Most would agree that having weights at home makes working out more convenient. But owning an in-home weight set may have seemed like it would take up too much space — until now. 
The Bowflex SelectTech 552 Adjustable Dumbbells ($259; amazon.com) are a best-selling product on Amazon, with over 3,500 customers reviewing this product, giving it a 4.7-star average rating. Most notably, reviewers commented on how convenient these were to use at home since they're adjustable and take up much less room in the home than a full set of weights. 
If you aren't currently incorporating weight training into your routine, there are several reasons to start. For one, according to 2014 research from UCLA, weightlifting can actually help you live longer, since the more muscle mass you have, the less likely you are to die prematurely. And if that isn't enough to convince you, weight training has also been linked to better sleep, stronger bones, better balance and less depression and anxiety. 
How do these adjustable weights work? This pair of dumbbells replaces 15 pairs of weights. Each one ranges from 5 pounds all the way up to 52.5 pounds. For the first 25 pounds, the weight can be increased by increments of 2.5 pounds. Changing the weight is easy. All you do is use the selection dials to switch in between exercises. And for those who want to track their progress, there's a free Bowflex SelectTech training app available for iOS and Android. 
If you're ready to up your weight training game straight from home, this is the set to choose. Not only will you save on space within the home, but you'll also live more efficiently when you can skip that commute to and from the gym.
