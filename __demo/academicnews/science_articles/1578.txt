Why Massachusetts should NOT change its time zone
The pros and cons to having daylight saving time all the time.

Some states and territories already don’t adhere to the twice-yearly time change: Hawaii and Arizona, as well as some Amish communities and overseas territories, do not follow daylight saving time. If Massachusetts did adopt the Atlantic Time Zone, it would be on the same schedule as some Canadian provinces and Puerto Rico.
 Here are the benefits of the possible switch, according to Prerau: 
• Residents would not have to change the clocks every year
• They would no longer have to adjust to a new time when switching hours
• It will be lighter in the evenings in Massachusetts during the winter, when it’s usually dark and cold
 But Prerau said there would be significantly more negative effects: 
• Massachusetts time would be out of step with the rest of the country during the winter
• National cable and network channels would have to add another time zone 
• Viewers would have to stay up even later to watch award ceremonies and sports games 
The commission’s proposal is not close to implementation. There will be a final vote on Nov. 1, and then the report will go on to lawmakers to create potential bills, The Wall Street Journal reported.
 What are the other effects of daylight saving time?  
Losing one hour of sleep as a result of daylight saving time may raise the risk of heart attacks, according to one 2014 study led by the University of Colorado in Denver. After Americans gained back the hour in the fall, the risk of heart attacks declined 21%. That said, people with sleep apnea and those who don’t sleep enough are already at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, regardless any other factors, according to the National Sleep Foundation.
Traffic accidents also rise after the clocks fall back (or spring forward), according to one 2001 research paper published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Sleep deprivation due to the loss of the hour in the spring showed a small increase in the number of accidents, whereas the anticipation of a longer day in the fall caused more fatal accidents when Americans gained an hour, possibly linked to alcohol consumption and driving while tired.
 How do you overcome the transition to daylight saving time?  
Keep your schedule. You don’t have to go to sleep an hour earlier when the clocks fall back an hour, according to the nonprofit medical center Cleveland Clinic. Be consistent with eating, exercising and other daily habits, too. Avoid long naps and give yourself a ritual for the end of the day. Put the smartphone or laptop down 30 minutes before bed, and go for a walk or find something else to do around sunset when people tend to get drowsy and plop in front of the television and doze off.
