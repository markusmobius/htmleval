 Call Me By Your Name: An intoxicating, sensual story of first love and desire
 Luca Guadagnino’s gorgeous new film Call Me By Your Name adapts André Aciman’s 2007 novel about a precocious 17-year-old named Elio (Timothée Chalamet), who falls in lust and love with his father’s 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver (Armie Hammer). And it's remarkable for how it turns literature into pure cinema, all emotion and image and heady sensation.
 Set in 1983 in Northern Italy, Call Me By Your Name is undoubtedly a gay love story, though it’s less about coming out than coming of age. It also captures a kind of love that’s equal parts passion and torment, a kind of irrational heart fire that opens a gate into something longer-lasting. The film is a lush, heady experience for the body, but it’s also an arousal for the soul.
 "Outside of a few short moments in Ismail Merchant and James Ivory’s 'Maurice,' and Ang Lee’s 'Brokeback Mountain,' the love and intimacy between two male characters has never truly felt this real or emotionally heartbreaking in a theatrical context. It’s almost revolutionary. It’s cinematic art." Gregory Ellwood, the Playlist
