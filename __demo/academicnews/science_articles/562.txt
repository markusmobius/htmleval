Hi everyone! I’m Michelle L. Dozois, a friend of Smarter Living, and this week the editor, Tim Herrera, has invited to me to talk about one of my favorite topics: hygge.
Hygge (pronounced HOO-gah) is the Danish concept of coziness. If you’re not familiar, here’s a crash course, and if you want to dive in further (you will, and you should), here are some books to check out.
Winter is the most hygge season — you can be hygge in summer, but it’s much easier to achieve when it’s cold outside — and my favorite hygge tradition is to seek out New York City’s best mulled wine. (I recommend The Grey Dog’s.)
However, hygge is best enjoyed at home, since you can maximize the hygge-ness of your surroundings. (As a few readers pointed out, to be precise, the adjective form in Danish is “hyggelig.”) For that, I love Instant Gourmet Crown Mulling Spices. It’s also great to bring to holiday parties, if your hosts have space on their stove for you to set up shop.
In collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are four other cheap(ish) items to help you have a hygge winter.
Slippers
This winter, I’m on a quest to see how many faux-fur items I can wear at once, partly inspired by this essay on why you should buy a silly winter coat.
When you’re settling in for a hygge evening, everything you’re wearing should be comfortable. There’s even a term for your pants that are oh-so-comfortable but shouldn’t be seen in public: hyggebukser. Slippers are the exclamation point on your hyggebukser.
The best slippers are fuzzy and warm without making your feet sweaty and are easy to slip on and off without using your hands, which are, of course, busy being warmed by your mug of mulled wine.
Dutch Oven
Comfort food is a hygge must. Unfortunately, I’m no cook — my halfhearted attempts at preparing dinner all inevitably end up affectionately being referred to as “gruel” by my husband, who is a much better cook.
It’s a resolution of mine to fix that in 2018, so someday I’ll put my Dutch oven to better use by cooking hearty stews, serving up decadent mac and cheese, and maybe even attempting to replicate my mother-in-law’s Knoephla soup recipe. (It’s a North Dakota thing.)
Miniature Lights
Lighting is an integral part of hygge. According to “The Little Book of Hygge,” 85 percent of Danes mention candles when asked what they most associate with hygge.
I’m here to make the case for indoor miniature lights, too. Tiny, warm white lights add a glow that magnifies that hygge vibe. Line your mantle or bookshelves, and don’t store them away until at least February (please unplug when unattended, friends). It’s not lazy. It’s hygge!
Dog Bed
For me, peak hygge is curling up on my couch with my hyggebukser, slippers and mulled wine as my dog, Zuki, rests in my lap or on my leg. She is kind of a hygge expert.
But dogs need their own hygge spot, too. If you have a four-legged friend keeping you company, think about getting the Majestic Pet Products Suede Bagel Dog Bed, Wirecutter’s favorite dog bed for most pooches.
