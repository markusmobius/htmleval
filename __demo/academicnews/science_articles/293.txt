These Numbers Prove It’s A Kind World After All
Kindness defeats hate 💕
It has been a turbulent few years, with monumental changes all over the world. If you think the last several years have been disappointing for humanity, you’re not alone: only 6 percent of Americans believe our society is improving. The good news? The facts tell a different story.
This constant attention to fault and flaw overlooks just how much goodness truly exists in the world. That’s why we’ve partnered with Dignity Health to highlight 15 ways humanity is only getting better, proving our world has never looked so good.

More than a century of experience and years of scientific research have shown that medicine is more effective when delivered with humankindness. Dignity Health believes that humankindness holds the power to heal the mind, body, and spirit.
