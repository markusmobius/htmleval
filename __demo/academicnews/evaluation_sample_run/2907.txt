After LeBron James reached 30,000 career points in the Cavaliers’ loss to the Spurs on Tuesday night, many of his friends, former teammates, celebrities and family congratulated him on the amazing accomplishment.
When Fox Sports Ohio showed James a video combining the congratulatory messages, the 33-year-old laughed, looked emotional, and at the end, he said he didn’t know what to say.

James said:
“That’s incredible. I was already at a loss for words, and now I have nothing to say. Just to my family and my friends: I wouldn’t be in this position without them. They give me the energy and the commitment and the effort for me to be able to go out and work on my craft every day, especially for my wife and my kids, not being able to be there as much as I like. They sacrifice so much for me. This is something obviously you could tell I wasn’t ready for. It’s an unbelievable feat, and hopefully I can just keep going.”
