President Barack Obama once said, “And nobody is tougher and nobody is more determined to do the right thing, even when in the face of fierce opposition, than Barbara Boxer.” Since leaving the U.S. Senate after four terms representing California, Barbara Boxer, is still tough, doing the right thing, fighting for our country, and calling for responsible governance, social justice and environmental responsibility. She is founder and lead volunteer for PAC for a Change, The Fight Back PAC. PAC for a Change is a unique political committee - it engages volunteers and voters as well as raising funds and highlighting critical issues. Barbara Boxer has been married to her husband Stewart for 55 years, has two children and their spouses, and 4 grandchildren.
