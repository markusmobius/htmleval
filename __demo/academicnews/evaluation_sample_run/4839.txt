Among the companies with shares expected to actively trade in Tuesday’s session are Caterpillar, Union Drilling and Odyssey Marine Exploration.
Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) lowered its forecast for profit growth over the next few years, citing sluggish economic growth, but said it could stay profitable even in a severe recession. Shares slipped 1.6% to $89.38 premarket.
Sidewinder Drilling Inc. has agreed to buy Union Drilling Inc. (UDRL) for about $242 million in cash as the Houston-based land drilling company looks to expand its footprint and reach customers in more regions. Sidewinder–which is controlled by Avista Capital Partners and targets unconventional oil-and-gas resource plays throughout the U.S.–will pay $6.50 for each Union Drilling share, a 6% premium over Union’s Monday closing price. Shares climbed 5.9% to $6.49 in recent premarket trading.
Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. (OMEX) said two recovery projects in the Atlantic Ocean will be deferred until the second quarter of 2013, citing current weather conditions and a previous commitment to another charter. Shares of the company, which has made a name for itself finding sunken treasure using high-tech deep-water equipment, dropped 23% to $2.85 in premarket trade.
