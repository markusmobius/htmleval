This Is When Daylight Saving Time 2017 Begins
Here are just a few ways it can affect your life.
Despite what the warm weather suggests, we’re still a few weeks from the official start of spring. But at least our clocks will be in the mood when they spring forward an hour this weekend.
Daylight saving time will begin on Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 2 a.m.
The time-honored tradition (sorry) will steal one precious hour of sleep. While that may not seem like a huge deal, experts say it’s a lot harder on our bodies than the “fall back” daylight saving adjustment. Here’s how:
It’s associated with higher rates of heart attacks.
A large 2014 study found that the Monday following the spring DST adjustment was associated with a 25 percent jump in heart attacks compared with other Mondays during the year. This may mean that those who are vulnerable to cardiac issues may experience a greater risk for heart trouble following the time change. 
It might be harder on your body clock.
Research shows that people’s circadian rhythms never fully adjust to springing forward. This is specifically true for night owls, since they’re already more prone to sleep deprivation. This means we may be more irritable and sluggish than usual following the time change since we’re lacking rest. So fun!
The sleep loss can lead to lifestyle consequences.
Research shows that the grogginess we experience following the time change may lead to an increased risk of car accidents, and a 2016 study also found DST prompts harsher legal sentences from judges compared to sentences awarded on other days of the year. This likely can be attributed to sleep loss as well, not to mention the other risks of getting fewer Zs, like a compromised immune system and lower productivity.
The best way to make up for lost sleep is to prioritize rest and keep a regular, healthy sleep schedule. And if the struggle is still real, here are a few more tips to help get adequate rest. 
Take that, DST.
