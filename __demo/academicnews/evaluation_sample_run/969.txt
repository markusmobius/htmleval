Gwen Stefani's Ex Is Reportedly Dating The Unlikeliest Of Stars
Who knew?
Well, we didn’t see this coming!
Gwen Stefani’s rocker ex-husband, Gavin Rossdale, is reportedly dating Elin Nordegren, according to an Us Weekly source. Nordegren, a former nanny and model, is most famous for her nearly six-year marriage to Tiger Woods, which we all know ended in scandal. 
“Elin flies to L.A. on her private plane a lot,” the Us Weekly source said of the mother of two. “They want to make it work.”
Rossdale has not dated anyone since splitting with Stefani in August 2015 after nearly 13 years of marriage and three children together. It was rumored the two broke up because the rocker was reportedly cheating with the family’s nanny for many years. 
Nordegren herself was inadvertently caught up in a cheating scandal when her husband’s many infidelities became public knowledge in 2009. Since splitting from Woods in 2010, she’s dated billionaire Chris Cline. 
The Huffington Post has reached out to reps for Rossdale and Nordegren and will update this post accordingly.
