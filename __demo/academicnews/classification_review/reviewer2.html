Photograph: Metropolitan police/PA", "The police are investigating a new complaint of sexual assault against John Worboys, the black-cab rapist, it has been confirmed, as prison authorities moved him to a London jail ahead of his scheduled release. The impact on Worboys\u2019 potential release is unknown but the move will give fresh hope to his victims that his release may be halted if he is arrested or charged in connection with a further offence. The Metropolitan police said they were investigating an allegation made this month of a sexual assault 20 years ago. \u201cEnquiries by officers from the child abuse and sexual offences command are ongoing,\u201d the Met said in a statement. Detectives have already consulted lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service, the organisation responsible for authorising criminal charges in England and Wales, though this does not necessarily mean charges will follow. It is understood the CPS has provided \u201cearly investigative advice\u201d to the new police investigation into Worboys. One of Worboys\u2019 victims, who has campaigned against his release and said she wants him excluded from Greater London if he is freed, said: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that another person has come forward. I\u2019m sure Worboys has many, many more victims. I hope now the Met will treat this extremely seriously and that more people might yet come forward. I\u2019d urge other victims to do so.\u201d Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer from Slater and Gordon, which represented 11 of Worboys\u2019 victims, added: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment while there is an ongoing investigation, but we would urge anyone with any information that may aid the criminal investigation to contact the police.\u201d It emerged on Monday that Worboys had been moved from HMP Wakefield to HMP Belmarsh in south-east London. There had been calls to keep him out of the capital, where he carried out most of his attacks. The justice secretary, David Gauke, promised MPs that the \u201cmost stringent licensing conditions\u201d would be placed on Worboys when he was released from prison and \u201cthe concerns of victims will be put at the heart of the process\u201d. It is understood that Worboys\u2019 release from Wakefield would have been more conspicuous as it is a high-security prison, from which few inmates are directly released. Belmarsh is a mix of high security and a local prison with many daily releases. At justice questions in the House of Commons, the Tory MP Zac Goldsmith pressed Gauke to \u201cassure us that he will do absolutely everything in his power to ensure that Worboys is released with strict licensing conditions that keep him out of Greater London\u201d. The justice secretary said the precise conditions of his release would be decided at an operational level. \u201cBut let me reassure [Goldsmith] that nearly a fortnight ago I wrote to the relevant authorities stressing the needs to ensure that the concerns of victims are put at the heart of this process, and ensuring that the most stringent measures are taken in place in terms of conditions,\u201d he said. The Parole Board is able to assess the continued risk posed by prisoners based on psychiatrist and prison guard reports at Parole Board hearings that take place around once a year for each offender. Some of the hearings are oral, some of them written. In November, a three-person panel of the Parole Board directed the release of Worboys, following an oral hearing. He will be released back into society under strict monitoring on a licence period of at least 10 years. Parole Board hearings are held in private and reasons for release are not made public, although a consultation is to be launched on how the body shares its decision-making with the public. The Parole Board is an independent body and its recommendation for Worboys\u2019 release cannot be overturned by the Ministry of Justice. There are examples of Parole Board decisions being challenged by judicial review in the courts, but only when the prisoner has been denied release. Victims of Worboys are pursuing a crowdfunded judicial review to challenge his release. They have asked Gauke to support their legal action. Scorer said of the disclosure of the Belmarsh move: \u201cThis is extremely distressing for our clients as yet again they have not been informed about developments. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace that they are perpetually ignored by the authorities and are not consulted about his release. It is an insult that they have had to find out from the media of every new development in this case and it is crucial that they are kept updated.\u201d Additional reporting by Rob Booth and Vikram Dodd  Topics"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

All these founders who started college, then dropped out and built companies that ended up defining people's lives.   Rather than follow the ideology that you have to drop out to start a company, I think ThirdEye shows that\u2019s not necessarily true.  ThirdEye, a start-up by Penn students to help the visually impaired, is sold https://t.co/WXMSrDzb64 via @PhillyBusiness \u2014 Rajat Bhageria (@RajatBhageria) February 15, 2017  We've always believed college is the best time to start a company, because resources on campus are available to you. We built a product \u2014 from our dorm rooms \u2014 that hundreds of visually impaired people all over the world are using on a daily basis, without dropping out, and without taking any risks at all.   How I juggled school and starting a business   I definitely didn\u2019t have the stereotypical freshmen college experience. I didn\u2019t do the things that most of my peers were doing. But it was a great exercise in learning how to prioritize what matters to me.   Obviously building ThirdEye into something that actually made a difference had a hierarchy. What\u2019s really cool is that I kind of structured my course work and life around that goal. My social life wasn\u2019t going to fraternity parties and going out with friends, but rather having lunch and dinners with interesting entrepreneurs, or interesting people building cool stuff. I'd pick their brains about how they do what they do.   The courses I took were tailored so that they were central to what I was doing with ThirdEye. It was really cool figuring out how to kill two birds with one stone.   The mentors I look up to   On campus, there are professors I\u2019m always working with. Off campus, I have entrepreneurs who aren\u2019t mentors, but rather friends I can call or text and grab coffee with.   More accurately, my support group has always been people I haven\u2019t actually met, but who mentor me from a distance. The two figures I point to, and are definitely cliche but very personal to me, are Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. I would throw Winston Churchill into that group as well, with his quote, \u201cWhen you\u2019re going through hell, keep going.\u201d The way they lived their lives helped inspire the way I built ThirdEye, and I hope to continue that in my later companies.   My ultimate life goal   I think I\u2019ve figured out I want to build a 100-year company. Something that lasts for a long time. I want to build a beautiful organization of people who come in every single day feeling as though they\u2019re having a significant impact on the world. It\u2019s kind of like a family. At the end of the day, I want to build products that really make an impact.   What I would tell my high school self   I was doing science fair projects in high school, which is very different from startups, but you have to learn how to sell yourself. How do you perceive yourself as a really smart person? It\u2019s more about the perception than it is about the thing. Learning how to do that was something I learned from science fairs.   For any high school student, it can be extremely valuable to work on some sort of project where you have to take an idea in your head which you know nothing about. You're forced to figure out how to solve the problem, ask for advice, read books all day, and then learn how to do everything else, from the science, to the legal, to building a team. Taking something in your head and making it into a reality; that\u2019s by the far the best education you can get."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Mr. Diallo\u2019s death sent racial tensions in the city nearly to a boiling point \u2014 helped along by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who regularly shunned meetings with black leaders and failed to treat the crisis with the urgency it required. Now Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, are dealing differently with their own Diallo-style disaster. Police officers firing 50 rounds early last Saturday killed Sean Bell, an unarmed man who was to have married his high school sweetheart later in the day. The mayor and the commissioner moved quickly to answer questions and to hear the concerns of the victim\u2019s family and the community. But their responsiveness will not bring back Sean Bell. The challenge here is far greater than good communications. The officers who killed Mr. Bell were part of a sting operation at a Queens nightclub suspected of narcotics, prostitution and weapons violations. According to published reports, the officers have said that as Mr. Bell and his friends left the club and headed toward their car, an undercover detective heard one of them say he was going to get a gun. They also reportedly said that when the men entered the car, the detective pulled his gun and identified himself, but the car suddenly gunned forward, hit him in the shin and then struck an unmarked police minivan. The officers then opened fire. The tragedy may simply involve two sets of very frightened men who reacted instinctively to what they thought was imminent danger. But only one of the sets was armed. There was no gun in the car, nor on the shooting victims, who sat helpless inside while five police officers began firing 50 rounds at them. One emptied his gun, a 9mm semiautomatic, reloaded and emptied it again, accounting for 31 rounds. The shooting appears to have been frantic, with bullets shattering windows as far away as the AirTrain station, hundreds of yards from the scene. Two of Mr. Bell\u2019s companions were injured; miraculously, there were no other casualties. Unlike the Diallo tragedy, the officers involved in the Queens shooting were not all white. They were also not inexperienced. The first bullet came from an officer with five years on the job, and the detective who fired the 31 rounds had 12. But it is hard to explain their actions as anything but panic. Police rules mandate that an officer pause after firing three rounds to assess the situation. If the shooters had followed procedures, they might have seen there was no threat before it was too late. Mayor Bloomberg has rightly called for a quick and impartial investigation. The officers must be held accountable for what has happened. But the Police Department must also confront the fact that a disaster that everyone swore to prevent seven years ago has repeated itself in Queens. A version of this editorial appears in print on , on Page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: 50 Bullets and a Death in Queens."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Scientists answer | Dana Nuccitelli", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Donald Trump listens to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt after announcing his decision that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 1, 2017. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters", "The climate is changing. That\u2019s not the debate. The debate is how do we know what the ideal surface temperature is in 2100? Pruitt\u2019s goal is to sow doubt on behalf of his oil industry allies in order to weaken and delay climate policies. Shifting the \u2018debate\u2019 toward \u2018the ideal surface temperature\u2019 achieves that goal by creating the perception that we don\u2019t know what temperature we should aim for. It\u2019s in line with his boss\u2019 recent ignorant tweet suggesting that \u201cPerhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming.\u201d  I spoke with a number of climate scientists who agreed that to minimize the risks associated with rapid human-caused climate change, from a practical standpoint the \u2018ideal temperature\u2019 is as close to the current one as possible. Temperature isn\u2019t the issue - temperature change is", "Stefan Rahmstorf, Head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research pointed out that we\u2019re not concerned about specific temperatures; it\u2019s rapid temperature changes that cause problems: Pruitt of course is trying to have a strawman debate, distracting from the fact that not a certain temperature as such is better or worse, but that a change from what we are adapted to is a problem, especially a very rapid change - in either direction, cooling or warming, this causes big disruption.  We should not stray too far away from what we and the currently existing ecosystems have evolved for. That is the optimum, simply because it is what we\u2019re highly adapted to, and any major change is going to be very painful. Civilization developed in a stable climate", "Texas Tech\u2019s Katharine Hayhoe agreed, noting that human civilization has developed in the relatively stable climate of the past 10,000 years. There is no one perfect temperature for the earth, but there is for us humans, and that\u2019s the temperature we\u2019ve had over the last few thousands of years when we built our civilization, agriculture, economy, and infrastructure. Global average temperature over the last few millennia has fluctuated by a few tenths of degrees; today, it\u2019s risen by nearly 1\u00b0C and counting. Why do we care? Because we are perfectly adapted to our current conditions. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities are located within a metre of sea level. What happens when sea level rises a metre or more, as it\u2019s likely to this century? We can\u2019t pick up Shanghai or London or New York and move them. Most of our arable land is already carefully allocated and farmed.", "What happens when we can no longer grow the crops we used to, as climate shifts and water becomes more scarce in many subtropical areas? We can\u2019t just take over new land: someone else already owns it. What happens when our water resources diminish or even run out? We can\u2019t take over someone else\u2019s water rights without a war. We care about a changing climate because it exacerbates the risks we face today, and threatens the resources we depend on for our future. In fact, Hayhoe specifically answered this question in one of her \u2018Global Weirding\u2019 videos for PBS: The Paris climate targets are appropriate", "Michael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State also pointed out that we\u2019re approaching some critical temperature thresholds. For example, his research has shown that at warmer temperatures, reproduction of malaria-transmitting parasites increases rapidly. There are some absolute temperature thresholds that are important when it comes to agriculture (particularly in tropics), coral bleaching, infectious disease, and heat stress (e.g. the tropics becoming essentially unlivable). So while it\u2019s difficult to say what the \u201cideal temperature\u201d is, there clearly is a range of temperatures suitable for human civilization and there is a real danger that we\u2019re pushing toward the upper limit of that range. Naomi Oreskes, Professor of the History of Science and Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard similarly noted that according to the peer-reviewed literature on climate change impacts, we\u2019re already headed into dangerous territory: Of course, there is no \u2018ideal\u2019 temperature so we should not accept that framing. We have strong scientific evidence that anything above 2\u00b0C is likely to be deeply problematic. Even the roughly 1\u00b0C change we have already seen is having measurable, adverse effects. That\u2019s why with the Paris climate accords, every country in the world except the USA has agreed to try and limit global warming to no more than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, and preferably closer to 1.5\u00b0C. The targets would be even more aggressive if possible, but as Oreskes noted, we\u2019ve already caused 1\u00b0C of global warming, and transitioning away from fossil fuels will take time. From a practical standpoint, 2\u00b0C is the best we can plausibly achieve.", "Ideally, cut carbon pollution as quickly as possible", "When speaking with the scientific experts it quickly becomes clear that the ideal response to climate change involves a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. Global temperatures are already warming at a rate more than 20 times faster than Earth\u2019s fastest natural climate changes. It\u2019s that rapid rate of global warming that poses an existential threat. Species can only adapt so quickly. The longer we wait to slow that dangerously fast climate change, the worse the consequences will be.

Research pioneered by Dr. Albert Mehrabian shows that what we communicate non-verbally can be highly impactful. We are hardwired to listen to our senses without conscious thought, and this ability helps protect us from danger and saves us time making endless decisions throughout the day.  If we are so influenced by our senses, what else is subconsciously triggering our everyday decisions? Lately, I\u2019ve been trying to pay more attention to \u201cnudges\u201d in the built environment around us. The built environment includes the size and shape of our roads, parks, and buildings: these all drive our behavior. Specifically, I\u2019ve been in search of ways the built environment can affect decisions we make about our health. What we see, hear, smell, taste, and feel impacts our actions\u2014and emerging research in urban planning, occupational health, and behavioral science validates this. Here are just a few of the many ways to leverage the built environment to improve health outcomes: Nudges to encourage movement Building location and access to public amenities can impact how much we move. For example, research shows that proximity to parks and other recreational facilities is consistently associated with higher levels of physical activity and healthier weight status among youth and adults. The same goes for proximity to public transit\u2014there is a link between access to public transportation and physical activity since transit use typically involves walking to a bus or subway stop. In one study, train commuters walked an average of 30 percent more steps per day and were four times more likely to walk 10,000 steps per day than car commuters. Several studies show that simply letting people know the health benefits of taking the stairs and showing their location (like putting a sign in the elevator lobby or using stair banners, like these) increases stair usage by 54 percent. Taking this a bit further, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a \u201cStairWELL to Better Health\u201dcampaign in its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. They use music, art, an upgraded appearance, and motivational signage to nudge employees to use the stairs more often. (Check out their downloadable signs, and see \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d images of their stairwells.) Nudges to encourage healthy eating habits You may not have heard the term \u201cchoice architecture,\u201d but you experience its impact every time you stand next to the candy display at a checkout counter. Choice architecture refers to the different ways in which choices can be presented to consumers and the impact of that presentation on consumer decision making. For example, the number of choices presented, the manner in which attributes are described, and the presence of a \u201cdefault\u201d can all influence consumer choice. Many companies are using this strategy by reducing the number of unhealthy foods available in the workplace or by making them harder to find. \u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c Brian Wansink, director of Cornell University\u2019s Food and Brand Lab and author of Mindless Eating, suggests a number of ways our eating behavior is significantly impacted by the way food is presented to us. For example, in some of his studies, people were 44 percent less likely to snack in kitchens that were tidy versus kitchen environments that were messy. Keeping the kitchen clean is more than just a sanitation issue\u2014it can affect how much we eat. In another study, Wansink found that people tend to eat less on plates that are 9-10 inches in diameter. People piled up food on larger plates, but felt \u201cdeprived\u201d and went for a second helping when eating on smaller plates (around 6 inches in diameter). His other studies show that people are likely to serve themselves 20 percent less food on plates with \u201ccontrasting colors\u201d to the food they are eating, e.g., white pasta on a red or blue plate. White breads and pastas on white plates? That is a recipe for \u201ccarb-loading\u201d! Nudges to reduce stress and improve well-being We have a strong desire to be in and among nature. It\u2019s only natural: for most of human history we spent all our time outdoors. This preference, often referred to biophilia, was introduced and popularized by E.O. Wilson, known as the \u201cfather of biodiversity.\u201d Wilson suggests that there is an instinctive bond between human beings and other living systems. In Biophilic Design: Theory, Science and Practice, authors Stephen R. Kellert, Judith Heerwagen, and Martin Mador describe the importance of nature for human productivity: \u201cNature is rife with sensory richness and variety in patterns, textures, light, and colors. All organisms respond with genetically programmed reflexes to the diurnal and seasonal patterns of sunlight and climate.\u201d Interestingly, biophilia-based design can be manifested in many ways. The most obvious way is to incorporate real plants, water, and natural views into buildings. Another way is to create \u201cnatural analogues\u201d or use materials and patterns that evoke nature, such as artwork, ornamentation, biomorphic forms, or the use of natural materials. A third way to use biophilia is through configuration of space, by organizing interior environments or man-made outdoor landscapes, using similar to natural environments elements. In its paper \u201cThe Economics of Biophilia,\u201d environmental consulting firm Terrapin Bright Green suggests: \u201cOver the last quarter century, case studies have documented the advantage of biophilic experience, including improved stress recovery rates, lower blood pressure, improved cognitive functions, enhanced mental stamina and focus, decreased violence and criminal activity, elevated moods and increased learning rates.\u201d There are hundreds more nudges and design strategies such as these that urban planners, architects, product designers, business owners, and homeowners can use to shape the environment around us to improve health and well-being. In the words of Winston Churchill: \u201cWe shape our buildings; thereafter, our buildings shape us.\u201d The key is to be aware of how our environment affects us and to use this knowledge for good.", "This article originally appeared on QuietRev.com.

The suit alleges that the hotel\u2019s practice of giving Latino guests\u2019 information to federal authorities without a warrant \u201cviolates federal and state civil rights laws barring discrimination based on national origin, and protections against unreasonable searches,\u201d according to a statement from the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF). The suit, which also names hotel parent company G6 Hospitality LLC, was filed by MALDEF in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The hotel company is accused of revealing the information \u2014 which included names and room numbers \u2014 to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at two Phoenix, Arizona, locations, according to MALDEF. The company also stands accused of violating state consumer fraud protections. Motel 6 gave guest information to immigration authorities, Washington AG says \u201cIt is in no company\u2019s interests to target and to violate the rights of any of its customers,\u201d Thomas Saenz, MALDEF president and general counsel, said in the statement. \u201cIf business incentives prove insufficient to deter poor practices, there are also powerful legal consequences for engaging in the kind of anti-consumer activity alleged here.\u201d The organization is pursuing class-action status for the lawsuit. The eight Latino plaintiffs in the lawsuit were detained last year after presenting official identification while checking into two Phoenix-area hotels, MALDEF said. \u201cThis lawsuit should serve as a warning to companies that attempt to enforce immigration laws by conspiring with the federal government to violate the civil rights of their guests,\u201d Andres Gallegos, an attorney at MALDEF, said in the statement. \u201cOur clients now face being separated from their families simply because they rented a hotel room.\u201d", "Motel 6's corporate office said in a statement to NBC News on Tuesday that, \u201cIn September, Motel 6 issued a directive to every one of our more than 1,400 locations, making it clear that they are prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guests lists to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\" \"While we cannot comment on specific pending litigation, we take this issue and the privacy of our guests very seriously,\" the statement said. Earlier this month, the Washington state attorney general also sued Motel 6, alleging that the chain disclosed the private information of thousands of its guests to immigration authorities. State Attorney General Bob Ferguson said motel employees had given out the names, birth dates, driver\u2019s license numbers and room numbers of more than 9,000 guests to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents without a warrant, according to The Associated Press. At least six people were detained or near the motel property during a two-year period. Ferguson\u2019s office began investigation the hotel chain after reports that Motel 6 workers in Phoenix had been giving out guest information to immigration agents. At the time, Motel 6 said in a statement posted to social media: \"This was implemented at the local level without the knowledge of senior management.

Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian", "A man who has been stateless for 31 years has been denied protection in the UK after the Home Office refused to accept he was originally from Palestine, despite advising him to return there on two occasions. Mohammed Al-Mustafa, 36, left Palestine at the age of five with his parents after his brother was killed. They did not have identity documents and he has lived without legal status in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Italy and France before arriving in the UK in 2010. His parents have both since died. Al-Mustafa claimed asylum in the UK in 2010. The Home Office rejected the claim, noting his nationality as \u201cPalestinian Authority\u201d and saying he would not be personally at risk if he returned. He tried to return to Palestine twice, but could not because he had no papers. He then claimed he was stateless in June 2016. But last year his claim was rejected on the grounds that the Home Office did not believe he was Palestinian. Cynthia Orchard, legal policy officer for Asylum Aid, said: \u201cGenerally, if someone is accepted as being from Palestine and they haven\u2019t been granted refugee status elsewhere they should be recognised and granted as a stateless person in the UK, because the UK doesn\u2019t recognise Palestine as a state.\u201d   What is statelessness?  A stateless person is someone who is not recognised as a citizen of any country. This often means they cannot attend school, legally work, vote, or access legal protections.  How many stateless people are there?  UNHCR estimates there are more than 10 million stateless people around the world.  Where do stateless people come from?   Stateless people come from a range of places, including Palestine, Kuwait, Cote d'Ivoire, Zimbabwe, Western Sahara, and the former Soviet Union.  How do you become stateless?  Statelessness is caused by a range of things, including gaps in nationality laws. For example, in countries where citizenship is passed on by descent, a child of unknown parentage will not be given citizenship unless there is a law protecting them.  Discrimination based on gender, ethnic, racial and religious grounds means some people are not recognised by their state or unable to pass on their citizenship to their children.  Statelessness can also occur when new states emerge or countries change borders, or if a child moves from their country of birth soon after they are born.  What does Britain do to protect stateless people?  In 2013, the UK established a procedure to consider statelessness claims. If someone is found to be stateless, they will be granted a protection visa for two and a half years, after which they can apply again for another visa.  How many people has the UK granted statelessness to?  It's hard to say, because the Home Office does not publish statistics about statelessness claims, but it's believed it grants protection to as few as 5% of applicants.  According to data provided by the Home Office for a report in 2016, by the end of March 2016, only 47.4% of applications that had been received since April 2013 had been decided, meaning some people were still waiting for a decision on their claim for three years.  Of the 754 decisions made by April 2016, only 39 (5.2%) were grants of protection. This compares with between 30-40% of initial decisions being grants in asylum cases. The refusal letter said some of Al-Mustafa\u2019s answers to questions posed by the Home Office cast \u201cserious doubts on [his] claim to be of Palestinian ethnicity\u201d, including that he could not accurately draw the Palestinian flag. Among the questions they claimed he had not answered satisfactorily during his statelessness interview was one about the Palestinian anthem, which was only adopted in Palestine in 1996, nine years after he left with his parents. \u201cI know the name of the anthem is al Fida\u2019i, but I didn\u2019t memorise the words and I told them, it\u2019s not about words. We can\u2019t get the country back because of the words,\u201d said Al-Mustafa. The Home Office also pointed to Al-Mustafa\u2019s answer to a question about whether Palestine had a particular national dish or food. Al-Mustafa replied: \u201cI haven\u2019t lived in Palestine to know these things. There\u2019s a couple, mutabbal, kibbeh and many other things.\u201d The refusal letter said: \u201cThe Home Office has conducted research into what food common [sic] around the Gaza strip. You failed to name any.\u201d Al-Mustafa\u2019s solicitor, Michael Ferguson, from the charity the Passage, called the Home Office\u2019s decision \u201cbrutal and illogical\u201d. \u201cAll through the asylum process, which started in 2010, they\u2019ve never questioned that he\u2019s from Palestine \u2013 they\u2019ve tried to send him back to Palestine themselves,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cI just think to pick out these small things, it\u2019s shameful really.\u201d Al-Mustafa has twice attempted to return to Palestine \u2013 in 2010 and 2015 \u2013 after the Home Office advised him to apply for the Assisted Voluntary Returns programme (AVR). In 2010 he was told that without a Palestinian passport and ID card return was not possible. The Palestinian General Delegates Office in London has since confirmed they cannot issue these documents to him. In 2015 the organisation running the AVR programme told Al-Mustafa they were \u201cunable to assist with the logistics of AVRs to Palestine\u201d and could offer him no further information or advice. Without legal status in the UK or the possibility of returning to Palestine, Al-Mustafa has slept rough, on and off for three years, on the streets, in a police station and in a churchyard.  The Home Office introduced a procedure for determining statelessness claims in 2013 to provide protection to people who are not recognised as citizens of any country.

If so, that may be a good thing\u2026if your baby is watching. A new study finds that babies as young as 13 months old can learn perseverance by watching you muddle through failure and repeatedly attempt to reach a goal. In the study, researchers presented babies with a challenge to activate a musical toy box. Babies who had just witnessed an adult struggle with a different kind of task a few seconds earlier, such as removing a key chain from a carabiner, tried harder to overcome their own little challenge, compared with babies who didn\u2019t witness such a struggle. [11 Facts Every Parent Should Know About Their Baby\u2019s Brain] The findings, published today (Sept. 21) in the journal Science, suggest there is \u201cpotential value in letting children \u2018see you sweat,\u2019\u201d the researchers wrote in their paper. \u201cShowing children that hard work works might encourage them to work hard too.\u201d Previous studies have shown that school-age children who persevere through modestly complicated tasks tend to be more successful academically later in life. However, scientists have not been able to determine how and when children develop such true grit. Most studies in this area have focused on children in grade school and middle school. Researchers at Stanford University, for example, found that seventh-graders who thought that intelligence was malleable and that effort determines achievement outperformed their peers who thought intelligence was fixed. The study was conducted over a two-year period through middle school. In the new study, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) wanted to see if babies might be inspired to persevere by witnessing a struggle that resulted in success. To do so, they recruited more than 260 babies (and their guardians). The babies, ages 13 to 18 months, were placed in three testing categories: A third of them watched an adult struggle and succeed with a task; a third watched adults succeed in a task easily; and a third were in a control group, not witnessing adults perform any kind of task. The task was either opening a container or removing a key chain from a carabiner. In the first group, the adult would pretend to struggle for 30 seconds with the task and then succeed, all the while making eye contact with the baby and saying things such as, \u201cHmm, I wonder how I can get my toy out of here?\u201d In the second group, the adult completed the task without struggling in 10 seconds, and then repeated this task twice more over the next 20 seconds. In all the groups, an adult would give the baby a trick music box with a big button that was inert and a hidden button that played music. The adult would activate the musical sound, hand the toy to the baby and leave the room. [Top 5 Benefits of Play] Although no babies found the hidden button, those who had witnessed an adult struggle pushed the inert button significantly more often and probed the toy longer before giving up, compared with the babies in the other groups. In fact, there were no significant differences in the amount of time both other groups examined the toy. The researchers hope that \u201cthe study reassures parents that they don\u2019t have to make everything look like it comes easily,\u201d said lead study author Julia Leonard, a graduate student at MIT. Leonard added that more research is needed to gauge the effects of watching adults struggle through tasks on babies\u2019 perseverance. \u201cWe have a lot of respect for parents and wouldn\u2019t presume to use a single laboratory study as a basis for parenting advice,\u201d Leonard told Live Science. \u201cHowever, we hope the study might interest parents, and we\u2019d be interested in knowing from parents whether simply showing children a couple of examples of struggling before succeeding seems to help their children persist more on tasks where the parent is confident that the child might succeed with effort,\u201d she said. And what about watching parents struggle through a task unsuccessfully? The researchers said they hope to investigate this in future studies. If an adult fails to achieve a goal, the baby might conclude that the task is beyond its ability, the researchers said.

Buzz60", "WASHINGTON \u2013 Thousands of FBI-issued phones have been affected by a glitch in the bureau's information management system that failed to preserve text messages during a five month period ending last May, two Justice Department officials said Wednesday. The breakdown was first discovered during a search of communications exchanged between two bureau officials who had been assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election, said the officials who are not authorized to comment publicly about the matter. That search, conducted by the Justice Department's inspector general, led to the removal of counter-intelligence agent Peter Strzok, whose text exchanges with colleague Lisa Page included disparaging references to President Trump. A review of the existing texts revealed that the FBI system not only failed to preserve the texts between Strzok and Page but also texts messages related to thousands of other bureau-issued devices between December 2016 and May 2017. Aside from the system breakdown, Republican lawmakers have seized on the text communications to question the credibility of Mueller's continuing inquiry into possible coordination between Russia and Trump campaign and subsequent obstruction of justice by the president. The lawmakers also have used the texts to hammer more broadly at the credibility of the FBI and its work on the Mueller probe. A number of congressional panels have requested the text communications between Strzok and Page to examine whether Mueller's investigation is biased against Trump. The texts were first discovered last summer by the Justice inspector general who is in the midst of a wide-ranging review of the department's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Earlier this week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions acknowledged the information system failure related to the Strzok and Page communications, indicating that the inspector general was reviewing the cause of the breakdown.

This, combined with evidence that the GOP\u2019s favorability has dropped, suggests that the Republicans are already in trouble for 2014 and maybe beyond. In the New York Times, Jeremy Peters suggests that the Republicans\u2019 hopes of a Senate majority are fading. In the New Republic, John Judis goes even further, suggesting that the Republicans are in their \u201clast days\u201d and \u201cdeath throes\u201d and that the party could be \u201ccripple(d)\u201d for \u201cnot just in the 2014 and 2016 elections, but for decades to come.\u201d Whoa. This is all too much, too soon. Let\u2019s take a broader look at public opinion and some recent history: 1) There are warning signs for Obama. First, it isn\u2019t like the public approves of his handling of the budget negotiations either \u2014 in the new Post/ABC poll 53 percent disapprove, a slight but not statistically significant increase from two weeks ago. Second, Gallup\u2019s tracking polls suggest that his overall approval rating has declined. Rasmussen finds the same thing. (And don\u2019t start in about Gallup\u2019s accuracy in the presidential election; there is nothing wrong with their presidential approval numbers.) I am the last person to put much stock in a single poll. But we have two polls showing the same trend \u2014 on top of a third warning sign: perhaps the best predictor of presidential approval, evaluations of the economy, are in freefall. I am happy to state that we need more polling to identify whether there is any trend in presidential approval. But all of these pieces of data deserve more attention than they are getting. 2) It may not matter that the public disapproves of Republicans more than Obama. One rejoinder to the above is that it only matters who the public blames the most. Ezra Klein writes: But a two-party political system with first-past-the-post elections is a zero-sum affair. That\u2019s true. But it matters a lot that low approval of Republicans is driven mostly by the well-documented split among Republicans. Thanks to Scott Clement of the Post\u2019s polling unit, I got some more detailed information about how approval breaks down among party lines. Assuming that the fraction of independents who lean Republican is what Gallup\u2019s data suggests, and assuming that Republican-leaning independents have attitudes similar to Republicans (a decent assumption), the Post\u2019s numbers suggest this: if Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in the electorate approved of congressional Republicans as much as Democrats approve of Obama (71% do), congressional Republicans would be no less popular than congressional Democrats are. Why does this matter? Because the politics of these approval numbers do not suggest that the GOP\u2019s disadvantage would redound to the Democrat\u2019s advantage in the midterm election in any clear zero-sum fashion. As Lynn Vavreck and I noted in our piece for CNN, party identification predicts the vote in congressional elections very well. The Republicans who don\u2019t approve of the GOP\u2019s handling of the budget negotiations aren\u2019t likely to go vote for a Democrat. 3) This all may blow over well before the election. The parameters of a deal are far from certain. The Senate negotiation seems like it might require lawmakers to revisit appropriations and the debt ceiling in the beginning of 2014. But if there is an accord \u2014 and if #1 and 2 are true then both parties have some incentive to produce one \u2014 then by November 2014 this may all seem like distant history. Nate Silver summarized this nicely (with a nice shout-out to The Gamble): Remember Syria? The fiscal cliff? Benghazi? The IRS scandal? The collapse of immigration reform? All of these were hyped as game-changing political moments by the news media, just as so many stories were during the election last year. In each case, the public\u2019s interest quickly waned once the news cycle turned over to another story. Most political stories have a fairly short half-life and won\u2019t turn out to be as consequential as they seem at the time. And Nate Cohn also reminds us that polls can shift. In general, if commentators make any consistent mistake, it is overestimating the importance of the events happening now. 4) The fundamentals of the midterm don\u2019t really advantage either party very much. Here is what Lynn and I said at CNN: Heading into 2014, a set of cross-currents seems likely to maintain this partisan balance. Republicans have more seats to defend in the House, and history shows that the larger a party\u2019s majority, the more seats the party is likely to lose. On top of that, the dismal marks that Americans give to Congress tend to hurt the majority party in the House most. But the Democrats face their own challenges. Two key fundamentals in both presidential and midterm elections are the economy and presidential approval. At the moment, the economy is growing only slowly, and approval of Obama has dropped 8 points since January. Both factors could end up hurting congressional Democrats. Another fundamental of congressional elections is the quality of the candidates being recruited. Democratic candidate recruitment has not gone so well that election handicappers give them an edge in many swing districts. Nate Cohn summarizes this nicely. And while the shift in the generic ballot is certainly good news for Democrats, political scientists Joseph Bafumi, Robert Erikson, and Christopher Wlezien have shown that during the election year the generic ballot tends to trend in the opposite direction as the president\u2019s party. This suggests that Democrats will lose ground in generic ballot polling during 2014. So what we\u2019re left with is the potential for either party to make small gains, but less potential for either party to make major gains. Certainly I cannot confidently predict that the Democrats will gain the majority. 5) The 1995-96 shutdown didn\u2019t necessarily help Clinton that much.  The conventional wisdom is that the shutdown helped Clinton in the 1996 election. I think that view has been debunked or at least substantially qualified by Sean Trende, Harry Enten, and Nate Cohn. I\u2019ll show my graph of Clinton approval from my post three years ago (and see also Nate Silver):", "Taken together, the two shutdowns left Clinton approval where it was when the first shutdown began. The subsequent increase in approval isn\u2019t evident until weeks after the last shutdown, thanks to a gap in the polling, so it isn\u2019t clear the shutdown had anything to do with it. In short, there is a lot of mythology about the Clinton-era shutdown, but the actual evidence is far more mixed. To be clear, I\u2019m not suggesting that this shutdown has been great for the GOP. It hasn\u2019t. They may even think it\u2019s been worse for them than I do! If that spurs them to make concessions so the government can reopen and we avoid possible default, I think that\u2019s a good outcome, policy-wise. But in the meantime, it seems to me that the prevailing commentary has been too quick to suggest that the GOP will suffer major consequences in the eyes of voters \u2014 now, in 2014, and beyond.

The views expressed here are solely hers.  (CNN) It started as a story about Sh***y Media Men. But it became a story about Amazing Media Women.  In mid-October 2017, shortly after the news broke about Harvey Weinstein allegedly being a serial predator -- and #MeToo broke the silence surrounding a complicit culture wide open -- a spreadsheet began quietly circulating around young women journalists. The spreadsheet was called \"Sh***y Media Men\" and invited women to anonymously post names of men in media whose behavior put them in the category of sexual harassers, and in some cases, assaulters. The cells on the spreadsheet began to fill with names and more names, some highlighted darkly in red to highlight men who had been accused by multiple women of sexual assault.", "Rachel Sklar As the list circulated, it went less-quietly viral, and Buzzfeed's Doree Shafrir wrote about it a day after its inception, causing an outward hand-wringing on Twitter about the danger of such a list (to men, natch) and a private stampede in media-type inboxes as women tried to suss out a copy and men quietly emailed lady-friends to see if they could take a look, too. Pretty soon the spreadsheet was pulled, but the screenshots lived on. As did the rumors. Companies began quiet investigations and a number of high-profile men in media were less-quietly terminated, while alongside them giants of media like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer were toppled amidst allegations of years of harassment and abuse of power. People began to reference the #MeToo movement as something that might be dangerously wielded against innocent men as opposed to a movement of women speaking publicly about their own experiences with harassment, and standing in solidarity with other victims.  #MeToo isn't about attacking men, of course. That's the wrong way to look at it, and one that erroneously centers on the concerns and comfort of men. Even so, it surely implicates men -- especially sh***y ones! -- so, in a refreshing change from many feminist issues, more than just women are thinking about it.  Read More", "Really, it was only a matter of time before Katie Roiphe got involved. Roiphe, who came to prominence in the 90s in an article (and book) denying the prevalence of date rape and continued as a purveyor of give-that-nice-dude-the-benefit-of-the-doubt-you-ladies-are-just-being-hysterical writing, had reliably inveighed against feminism over the years. In this one, she was contracted by Harper's to write about the Sh***y Media Men list. And this is where the Amazing Media Women come in. Like dominoes of sisterhood, the following happened in rapid succession:  (1) n+1 editor Dayna Tortorici tweeted that she'd heard Harper's was planning to out the author of the list: \"It's come to my attention that a legacy print magazine is planning to publish a piece 'outing' the woman who started the Sh***y [sic] Media Men list. All I can say is: don't. The risk of doxxing is high. It's not the right thing to do.\"  (2) Founder and publisher of the now-defunct-but-always-beloved The Toast, Nicole Cliffe, stepped up and urged Harper's to reconsider, and pledged to pay the fees for any writer who pulled their piece from the next Harper's issue in protest. Her inbox started to fill.  (3) Megan Lynch, VP and Editorial Director of Ecco publishing, tweeted that her company had pulled an ad from the next issue of Harper's: \"You can all guess why.\"  (4) The New York Times wrote about the matter under the headline \"A Feminist Twitter Campaign Targets Harper's Magazine and Katie Roiphe\" wherein it was reported that a fact-checker from Harper's \"contacted a person said to be a creator of the list and said the article identified her as someone widely believed to be one of the people behind it.\" Roiphe claimed that she'd had no plans to out the author and would never dream of doing so if she didn't want to be identified. (5) On Twitter, women began claiming to be the author of the list, standing up in a veritable \"I, Sh***y Media Men List-icus\" moment.  (6) Somewhere amid the hubbub, New York Magazine's The Cut and its editor, Stella Bugbee, gave the green light to a new piece.  (7) Wednesday night at 10:12 p.m., Bugbee published the piece by writer Moira Donegan. It was called: \"I Started the Media Men List.\"", "Overnight, Donegan has become a hero. Her name trended on Twitter. Her piece is now the most popular piece on the site. The New York Times updated its piece with a new headline leading with Donegan's name. Oh, and her account calls Roiphe's description of events into question to an eye-popping extent, since in Donegan's telling, the email from the fact-checker identified her as \"a woman widely believed to be one of the creators of the Sh***y [sic] Men in Media List.\" Like the sh***y men of media (obligatory disclaimer: #NotAllMediaMen!), Roiphe and Harper's have not come out looking good here. Here's who looks good:  (1) Tortorici, who took a stand publicly against outing and sounded the alarm about doxxing (and offering to pay for an ad to fill the space if necessary); (2) Cliffe, who according to the New York Times, \"pledged\" to pay approximately $19,000 in writers' fees and according to Cliffe, has already paid them;  (3) Lynch, who took a stand by pulling her company's ad and ended up on the right side of the story;  (4) The women of media Twitter, from the women claiming authorship to the women yelling loudly to collectively comprise the NYT's \"Feminist Twitter Campaign\" to the women who pledged to kick in with Cliffe for the pulled articles to the women who kept Donegan's name under wraps for so long;  (5) Stella Bugbee, for being an editor whom Moira Donegan could trust to stand behind her, and with her;  (6) And, most importantly, Moira Donegan, for her brave and honest and clear-eyed article -- and for starting the spreadsheet in the first place, because she saw that media needed a safe space for women, and that no one was providing that, so she tried to fill in that gap.", "Notice how Katie Roiphe is not on this list. That so-called feminist \"hysteria\" that Roiphe decried only yesterday is looking particularly well-founded given Donegan's account of the fact-checker email (with receipts) and let's just say Roiphe's veracity in speaking to the NYT has been roundly called into question.  Bugbee put her finger on it on Twitter: \"Katie Roiphe built her entire career telling men what they wanted to hear. A tactic for success only when men hold the keys to publishing.\" Bugbee holds her own keys, and used them here.  But also, Bugbee posits that Roiphe miscalculated, thinking that her version would not be contradicted because Donegan wouldn't go public. That makes sense, and here's why: Roiphe isn't part of a sisterhood. And when you're part of a sisterhood, you know that your sisters will have your back. I can only imagine what it meant to Donegan over the past few days watching friends and friendly feminists stepping up publicly to support her, many with their money and their reputations. I can only imagine what it meant to her to have Bugbee step up as an editor she could trust. And I can only imagine what it meant to see that Roiphe quote in the New York Times and feel brave enough -- and supported enough -- to challenge it. With receipts.  Late Thursday afternoon, Donegan tweeted: \"I'm so awed by and thankful for the amount of generosity, solidarity, and kindness that's been sent my way. Thank you\u2014really, it means more than you know.\" #MeToo is about women, standing up with and for other women, with the empathy of knowing exactly what they're talking about, because, well, them too. When I say I can only imagine how Donegan felt, it's because a decade (give or take) ago, I needed the Donegans, and the Bubgees, and the Cliffes, and the Torticis of the media world signaling that kind of solidarity.  Heck, I still need that. Whisper networks are imperfect, and they don't protect everyone (if they did, there'd be no need for a Sh***y Media Men list, and Harvey Weinstein and Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer would have been gone long ago). But it is also an unfair burden to place on women -- the gross abuses #MeToo has shown in sharp relief require an institutional response. Which is good for men too -- as Donegan acknowledges in her article, her list was \"vulnerable to false accusations,\" which in addition to potentially implicating someone who has not, in fact, harassed or abused, also risks undermining the credibility of legitimate accusations. It also leaves room for threats of legal action, especially from deep-pocketed alleged perpetrators (case in point: the current President!) which has a chilling effect on speaking up.  Join us on Twitter and Facebook So we come back around to women, left to fend for themselves when really they just want to work. With just whisper networks, the burden is on women to avoid and strategize rather than on systems and power structures to address and preclude. (This is perfectly expressed in a tweet by editor Hannah Giorgis: (sic) \"can't stop thinking about how many media dudes are having a perfectly normal thursday while the women around them deal with yet another wave of reminders that our safety matters less than their comfort.\") As Donegan writes,\"I had become so accustomed to hearing about open secrets, to men whose bad behavior was universally known & perpetually immune from consequence, that it seemed like no one in power cared about the women who were most vulnerable to it.\"  Well, guess what -- these women in power cared. It's a welcome, welcome shift in who has the power and what it's being used for. And it's right on time because -- to mix my metaphors, but not really -- time's up.

In stark contrast to the House rejection of the plan on Monday, a bipartisan coalition of senators \u2014 including both presidential candidates \u2014 showed no hesitation in backing a proposal that had drawn public scorn, though the outpouring eased somewhat after a market plunge followed the House defeat. The Senate margin was 74 to 25 in favor of the White House initiative to buy troubled securities in an effort to avoid an economic catastrophe. Only Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who is being treated for brain cancer, did not vote. The two Senate leaders, Senators Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, strongly urged their colleagues to approve the plan despite the political risk given public resentment. \u201cSupporting this legislation is the only way to make the best of a crisis and return our country to a path of economic stability, prosperity and growth,\u201d said Mr. Reid, who asked that senators vote formally from their desks. The presence in the Senate of both presidential candidates in the final weeks of the campaign also gave weight to the moment. The political tension was clear as Senator Barack Obama walked to the Republican side of the aisle to greet Senator John McCain, who offered a chilly look and a brief return handshake. Mr. McCain did not make remarks on the legislation. Mr. Obama, in his speech, said the bailout plan was regrettable but necessary and he referred to the stock market drop after the House vote. \u201cWhile that decline was devastating, the consequences of the credit crisis that caused it will be even worse if we do not act now,\u201d he said. President Bush issued a statement applauding the Senate for its vote in favor of a bill he called \u201cessential to the financial security of every American.\u201d He urged the House to follow suit. In the House, officials of both parties said they were increasingly confident that politically enticing provisions bootstrapped to the original bill \u2014 including $150 billion in tax breaks for individuals and businesses \u2014 would win over at least the dozen or so votes needed to reverse Monday\u2019s outcome and send the measure to President Bush. The stock market reflected nervous jitters over a vote that was to occur after it closed but that could affect the future of many Wall Street workers. The Dow Jones industrial average was off almost 220 points during the day, but recovered to close down just 19.6 points, or 0.2 percent, at 10,831.07. Besides the tax breaks, senators also made a change that had drawn widespread support in recent days \u2014 a temporary increase in the amount of bank deposits covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to $250,000 from $100,000. And the entire package was attached to legislation requiring insurers to treat mental health conditions more like general health problems, a long-sought goal of many lawmakers who demanded such parity. As the shape of the new bill became more clear Wednesday, some House Republicans and Democrats indicated that the changes were enough to get them to take another look at the measure and perhaps change their minds \u2014 even though the new items being added would substantially increase the burden on taxpayers. Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who on Monday voted no, said he found the new proposal more acceptable, as did Representative Jim Ramstad, a retiring Republican from Minnesota who voted in opposition as well. \u201cThe inclusion of parity, tax extenders and the F.D.I.C. increases has caused me to reconsider my position,\u201d Mr. Ramstad said. \u201cAll three additions have greatly improved the bill.\u201d Leaders of both parties in the House, who spent much of Wednesday on the phone taking the temperature of lawmakers not scheduled to return until Thursday, said they were identifying other potential converts as well, and were finding a more receptive audience for the revised measure because of the tax package and other changes.", "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky spoke on Capitol Hill after passage of the bailout plan. Credit Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times", "Some conservative House Republicans and liberal Democrats remained adamantly opposed. \u201cThe bailout legislation that the Senate is sending back to the House is a fraternal twin to the one I voted against on Monday \u2014 meet the new bill, same as the old bill,\u201d said Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas. While popular, the tax breaks, which had been the center of a bitter dispute between House and Senate Democrats, caused problems as well. A coalition of centrist Democrats led by Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, had refused to back the tax benefits unless they were deficit neutral \u2014 offset by tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere. The bill now includes the Senate version of the tax plan, which adds most of the cost to the deficit over the next decade. But the Senate leaders decided to present the House with a take-it-or-leave-it choice, and it is possible some Democrats could desert the bill over the tactic. Mr. Reid said the Senate would remain in session this week to see how House members react and whether they might attempt to change the bill, forcing another Senate review. Mr. Hoyer said he was disappointed in the Senate\u2019s decision on the tax breaks and worried it could cost Democratic votes. \u201cCertainly there are people who are upset we are making the deficit worse as we are trying to stabilize the economy,\u201d Mr. Hoyer told reporters. But in a telephone conference call among the Democratic leadership Wednesday morning, he told his colleagues he would back the measure because the economic rescue needed to take priority, according to participants. In the end, Senate leaders decided to overcome some of the ideological and political resistance that doomed the measure in the House with the tried-and-true Congressional approach of stuffing the bill with provisions that would make it hard for many lawmakers to resist. \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is get this thing passed,\u201d said Mr. Reid, denying he was trying to jam the House by giving members no choice but to accept the tax proposal he favored or again reject the bailout. The multiple tax breaks, called extenders in the Capitol because they renew or extend expiring tax benefits, appeal to many lawmakers and could provide a political argument for backing a bill that has otherwise been very unpopular. Instead of siding with a $700 billion bailout, lawmakers could now say they voted for increased protection for deposits at the neighborhood bank, income tax relief for middle-class taxpayers and aid for schools in rural areas where the federal government owns much of the land. \u201cThis bill has been packaged with a lot of very popular things to give it even more momentum,\u201d said Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama, who is an opponent. The approximately $150 billion in new tax breaks, which offer incentives for the use of renewable energy and relieve 24 million households from an estimated $65 billion alternative-minimum tax scheduled to take effect this year, would be offset by only about $40 billion in spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere. Moreover, the increase in federal deposit insurance will not be financed over the short term, as the insurance program now is, by assessing premiums on banks that benefit. Instead, banks will get an open-ended line of credit directly to the Treasury Department. But the Congressional Budget Office noted that federal law requires the banks to eventually make up any shortfall and any loans to be repaid, though not until at least 2010. The changes in the bill were measurable by volume. The initial proposal from the Treasury Department ran just three pages; the latest version exceeds 450. After receiving the proposal from Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. almost two weeks ago, Congress instituted a series of changes, including additional oversight, steps to limit home foreclosures and restrictions on the compensation of executives of institutions that take part in the Treasury program. Under pressure to tighten the plan even more, Congressional and administration negotiators decided to parcel out the $700 billion in installments, starting with a first tranche of $350 billion. And during a weekend of negotiations, they added as a final backstop a requirement that in five years the president must present Congress with a plan to make up any losses of tax funds by looking to the financial community to make up the difference.

Prof Basil Sharrack, of Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, said: \"To have a treatment which can potentially reverse disability is really a major achievement.\"  Around 100,000 people in the UK have MS, an incurable neurological condition.

Prof Snowden added: \"It's clear we have made a big impact on patients' lives, which is gratifying.\" Multiple sclerosis In MS the protective layer surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord - known as myelin - becomes damaged. The immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin, causing scarring or sclerosis. The damaged myelin disrupts the nerve signals - rather like the short circuit caused by a frayed electrical cable. If the process of inflammation and scarring is not treated then eventually the condition can cause permanent neurodegeneration.  The BBC's Panorama programme was given exclusive access to several patients who have undergone the stem cell transplant.  Steven Storey was diagnosed with MS in 2013 and, within a year, went from being an able-bodied athlete to needing a wheelchair and losing sensation in much of his body.  He said: \"I went from running marathons to needing 24-hour acute care. At one point I couldn't even hold a spoon and feed myself.\" Within a few days of the transplant he was able to move his toes, and after four months he could stand unaided. Steven still needs a wheelchair but is astounded at his progress: \"It's been incredible. I was in a dire place, but now I can swim and cycle and I am determined to walk.\"  Image caption Holly Drewry and Isla  Holly Drewry was just 21 when she was diagnosed with MS and her condition deteriorated after she gave birth to her daughter Isla. She said \"Within a couple of months I got worse and worse. I couldn't dress or wash myself; I didn't even have the strength to carry my daughter.\" Holly needed a wheelchair before her transplant, but after the treatment she walked out of hospital. She said: \"It's been a miracle. I got my life and my independence back and the future is bright again in terms of being a mum and doing everything with Isla.\"  Two years on she has suffered no relapses and there is no evidence of active disease on her scans. Doctors describe her MS as dormant, but there is hope that the transplant might be a permanent fix.  Image caption Profs Basil Sharrack (left) & John Snowden - a clinical partnership of neurology and haematology  Cost-effective The Royal Hallamshire Hospital - together with hospitals in the United States, Sweden and Brazil - is part of an international trial, MIST, which is assessing the long-term benefits of the stem cell transplant. All those on the trial have relapsing remitting MS, where patients experience attacks - or relapses - followed by periods of remission. The treatment involves intensive chemotherapy, so patients are warned that there are side-effects such as nausea and hair loss. Paul Kirkham, another MS patient, said he was glad to have had the transplant but added: \"It does knock you. I'd rather have done 10 rounds with Mike Tyson.\"  The transplant involves a one-off cost of around \u00a330,000, which is comparable to the yearly cost of some MS treatments.  Because the procedure involves no new drugs and instead re-purposes an existing therapy using the patient's own cells, there is little profit incentive for drug companies to get involved. Prof Richard Burt, Northwestern University, Chicago carried out the first HSCT for MS as long ago as 1995 and is coordinating the international trial which began in 2006.  He said: \"There has been resistance to this in the pharma and academic world. This is not a technology you can patent and we have achieved this without industry backing.\" A study published last year involving MS patients in Chicago showed significant reductions in neurological disability, and for some the improvements persisted for at least four years, although there was no comparative control group. The outcome of the more detailed MIST trial - which will report in a couple of years - could determine whether the stem cell transplant becomes a standard NHS treatment for many MS patients.  Dr Emma Gray, head of clinical trials at UK's MS Society , said: \"Ongoing research suggests stem cell treatments such as HSCT could offer hope, and it's clear that in the cases highlighted by Panorama they've had a life-changing impact.  \"However, trials have found that while HSCT may be able to stabilise or improve disability in some people with MS it may not be effective for all types of the condition.\"  Dr Gray said people should be aware it was an \"aggressive treatment that comes with significant risks\", but called for more research into HSCT so there could be greater understanding of its safety and long term effectiveness.", "Media caption Fergus Walsh reports on the cancer treatment which is 'rebooting' the immune system of MS patients like Steven Storey", "Panorama is broadcast on BBC One at 20:30 on Monday 18 January 2016."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times", "WASHINGTON \u2014 As a freewheeling candidate on the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump amassed a long list of promises. Some became rallying cries and signature to his candidacy (\u201cbuild the wall\u201d). Others reflected conventional Republican policy wishes (repealing the Affordable Care Act). And then there were the unorthodox pledges about how he would comport himself in office, a few probably improvised (\u201cI will never be in a bicycle race\u201d) or doomed from the start (\u201cWe won\u2019t tweet anymore \u2014 not presidential\u201d). Mr. Trump has described his first year in office as \u201ca year of real change.\u201d Here\u2019s an assessment on his progress on promises about his approach to the presidency. Draining the swamp Of the six measures Mr. Trump outlined in his 100-day action plan \u201cto clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington,\u201d he has kept his word on two, imposing lifetime bans on White House officials lobbying for foreign governments and requiring the elimination of two regulations for every one enacted. He has also partially fulfilled two pledges. His promised hiring freeze on federal employees was enacted in January 2017, but lifted in April. Additionally, he took a narrowly tailored approach to his pledge to bar White House and congressional officials from lobbying for five years after leaving office. Rather than a blanket restriction, his executive order specified that White House officials could not lobby the agencies they served, and did not cover congressional officials. But he has not taken any action on two other promises. Mr. Trump has yet to propose term limits for members of Congress or enact a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Forgoing a salary Mr. Trump, a billionaire, vowed to not take \u201ceven one dollar\u201d of his $400,000 annual salary as president, following in the footsteps of presidents like John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover. So far, he has kept his word, donating his paychecks to the National Park Service in the first quarter of 2017, the Education Department in the second, and then the Health and Human Services Department in the third to help combat the opioid crisis. The White House would not answer questions about what Mr. Trump would do with his paychecks in the fourth quarter of last year. Releasing his tax returns after an audit As the first presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his tax returns, Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed to do so once his Internal Revenue Service audit was complete. The pledge was flawed to begin with. Though tax lawyers may advise against it, the I.R.S. has said that an audit does not prevent individuals from releasing their own tax information. The Trump campaign also released a letter from his lawyers that said Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, before 2009, were \u201cclosed administratively\u201d \u2014 or no longer subject to an audit. But in May, Mr. Trump reneged on the promise in an interview with The Economist, moving the release date to \u201cafter I\u2019m out of office.\u201d Playing golf only in the interest of the country After incessantly chastising President Barack Obama for golfing, Mr. Trump promised during the campaign that \u201cbecause I\u2019m going to be working for you, I\u2019m not going to have time to go play golf.\u201d He later made an exception for \u201cleaders of countries and people who can help us.\u201d Yet Mr. Trump has played more golf than his predecessor, according to independent trackers. The White House has repeatedly declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s golf partners. While he played a round with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in February, he was also accompanied by professional golf players, not world leaders, for at least four games. Taking no vacations Mr. Trump pledged to \u201cnot be a president who took vacations\u201d and blasted Mr. Obama for his own personal trips. In a 2012 report, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the president is \u201calways on duty\u201d and that his vacations are considered official travel. Over the past year, Mr. Trump has taken some R&R. He spent 17 days in at his golf club in New Jersey, which the White House labeled a \u201cworking vacation,\u201d and voyaged to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a holiday respite that included presidential duties. It is unclear how those trips were different from the vacations that Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Obama for taking. The former president, for example, spent holidays in Hawaii \u2014 a frequent talking point of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 where he played golf, received intelligence briefings and visited troops. Over all, Mr. Trump has visited a Trump property one out of every three days since taking office. What else should we check?

Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.  (CNN) On my first day back at work as a network news correspondent after my first child was born 11 years ago, a late assignment meant I arrived home long after my daughter had gone to bed. A few mornings later, the phone rang as I got ready for work. My boss said I needed to travel to Massachusetts to cover a story. I hung up and burst into tears. My husband tried to make me feel better, saying I would be on the national news that evening, but all l could think about was being away from my daughter. My re-entry to the work world was anything but easy and seamless. Before I gave birth, I thought I'd return to my hard-charging television correspondent role three months after delivery and pick up exactly where I left off.", "And then I held my baby and couldn't imagine leaving her for an hour to get a haircut, let alone 12 hours, which is the time I typically logged each day at work before I became a mom. Read More I struggled with a changing identity and balancing the demands of motherhood with the challenges of a network role. Why hadn't anyone told me how hard it was going to be -- or was it just me? So many other women seemed to be handling things much better. If only I had known then that what I was going through was the \"fifth trimester,\" a term coined and trademarked by author Lauren Smith Brody, a former executive editor of Glamour magazine and a mother of two.  We mark pregnancy in three trimesters, and the \"fourth trimester\" is used to mean that time after delivery when your baby is adjusting to life outside the womb.", "Lauren Smith Brody is author of \"The Fifth Trimester.\"  The \"fifth trimester\"? It's the time when new mothers, just months after delivery, are going back to work but often before they feel emotionally and physically ready to return, said Brody, author of the new book \"The Fifth Trimester: The Working Mom's Guide to Style, Success, Sanity, and Big Success After Baby.\"  Brody considers the \"fifth trimester\" to be the first few months back at work, whether women return after a week or after six months of leave, whether they work in blue collar or white collar professions, whether they have paid leave, or are like the majority of Americans who work at companies that don't offer any paid leave. (The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not mandate paid maternity leave.)  \"For the first three trimesters, you could fill bookshelves full with the number of books out there, and then the same actually when (my son) was born, there was the fourth trimester, which was a term that was new to me at the time,\" she said. She was helped along by books about re-creating the womb during those first months after her son was born. \"But then I got back to work, and I had this weird feeling of both, 'Oh, thank goodness, I know how to do this,' and then also, 'Oh, no, I really don't know how to do this with a baby,' and there were very few resources to help me ease back in and to help me manage my expectations of myself and not blame myself for it being such a struggle.\"", "\"The Fifth Trimester\" includes tips and advice for new mothers returning to work.  Brody, whose sons are now 5 and 8, said she remembers feeling so harried when she returned to work that she didn't even take the time to look around to see whether any resources might be available for her. She realized later that she had undiagnosed postpartum anxiety after her first child was born. \"I hated that I wasn't what I expected of myself,\" she said. \"And that after all these years of achieving at work ... here I was with a baby, just absolutely incapacitated, and I was so thrown by that and so disappointed in myself.\" 'Everybody talked about guilt' The veteran women's magazine editor was open with her colleagues about her struggles in returning to work. As her sons got older, she found herself offering advice to women in the office who were starting families. And then, as she started thinking about what she might want to do next in her career, she wrote a memo of story ideas. The concept of promoting the \"fifth trimester\" was one of the ideas on her list.", "\"It was really, really eating at me,\" she said. \"I felt this sisterhood of mentorship and this working-mom mentor thing was really needed and real. And I knew that my experience alone is not enough to help everyone in the world, my God, definitely not. But if I could collect this huge breadth of experiences and put them all together and offer people that working-mom mentor that I didn't really feel like I had, that would be really valuable.\" She put together a 50-question survey and sent it via email to people within her network, asking that they also share it socially and with their respective networks of family, friends and colleagues. She hoped for 100 responses but ended up with more than 700, representing working women from every state in the country and from a range of professions, including police officers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, Fortune 500 executives, business owners, waitresses and freelancers. She followed up with more than 100 of the women, conducting in-depth interviews with them that help form the basis of her book.", "\"It was amazing to see the differences in their experiences, but what I actually found more remarkable was sort of the emotional through line of the things they had in common,\" Brody said. \"Everybody talked about guilt, even if it meant a different thing to each person. Everyone talked about coming back to work, feeling different and knowing that people saw them differently, no matter what field they were in.\" Seventy-five percent of the women Brody surveyed said they wished they had been able to take a longer maternity leave. When asked how much extra time they would want, the most common answer was \"a few more months,\" according to the book. This response tracks with what Brody heard from the women in terms of when they felt physically and emotionally back to normal after giving birth: The average respondent said they were physically back 5\u00bd months after delivery and emotionally back after almost six months. Brody interviewed women who returned to work a week after delivery and others who had six months of leave. \"Either way, there's a monumental transition,\" she said. \"I like to point out that the fifth trimester might be longer for some women and shorter for others. You kind of don't know how long that transition time is going to be until you're on the other side of it ... I will say that when women went back very, very early, they seemed to have lengthier transitions.\"", "Brody's survey is not scientific, she admits, but it does reflect some of the major stresses new mothers experience when they return to work. Even if a woman is able to take the three months of unpaid leave required in the United States under federal law in most cases (companies with fewer than 50 employees are exempt), she is still returning months before she feels emotionally and physically back -- and months before she is getting a decent night's sleep. The typical baby in Brody's survey was sleeping through the night at just over 7 months old. When you add in the stresses on a relationship, you've got what Brody aptly describes as a \"mess.\" Seventy-one percent of women said they battled more with their partners in the first three months after returning to work than they had ever before. It was the most stressful time in their relationship, they said, even more stressful than adjusting to a newborn or the first year of marriage. 'What do I need right now?' So what's a new working mother to do? Brody, who is a passionate advocate of paid leave, uses her book to focus less on what companies can and should do to help women with re-entry, and more on what women themselves can do. She provides tangible tips and helpful advice from women who have been there and who more than survived, they thrived. She covers such issues as \"how to win over any resentful colleagues\" and preparing for that first day back at work, which she calls the \"second cutting of the cord.\"  She encourages women to get their child care up and running slightly before the first day so they can try it out and adjust to leaving their loved one in the hands of someone else. She's proudest of a chapter on the importance of emotional health titled \"On Feeling Human Again\" and says the simplest way to feel very good again is to ask, \"What do I need right now?\" Think about what you need -- at home and at work -- and ask for it, she said.", "About one in seven women will have a postpartum mood or anxiety disorder, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Her risk increases if she is facing any kind of extenuating circumstance, such as single motherhood, loss of a job or a big life transition, according to Brody.  Going back to work sooner than you are ready can be an extenuating circumstance, she believes. One study found that the risk of postpartum depression was higher in women who took maternity leaves of less than six months. \"This is a matter of moms feeling like, from the very beginning, they can ask for what they need,\" she said. \"If you don't ask for what you need, you will find yourself in a deeper and deeper hole to dig yourself out of.\" Brody has also created a business called The Fifth Trimester, which works with new parents and companies to create more family-friendly cultures in the workplace. In addition to working with companies on ways to invest in women once they come back from work, she spends a lot of the time in her workshops talking about those \"soft skills\" that can help new mothers get what they need, whether it's at work or at home. She points to unique approaches some companies are taking, such as home furnishings firm Wayfair, where conversations begin about how employees want their jobs to transition even before they go on leave. \"They are so forward-thinking in this stuff, and they have just completely made it the norm that whenever someone is at the point where they announce a pregnancy or that their partner is going to have a baby, the conversation is completely opened up: 'How do you want your job to change and evolve?' \" Brody said. \" 'It is just an assumption that you're probably going to want to, so let's talk about it,' and then it becomes an opportunity, and this is something that I think a lot of companies of any size could do.\"", "She also points to how women can feel good about their skill set when they are back at work. New mothers are much more decisive about what they say \"no\" to -- they are making calculations about what comes at the expense of time with their child. \"But the things you say 'yes' to, like that new project you're taking on, you are so committed to it, because you've done the math on it, you've done the kind of emotional math on it to figure out, 'what am I going to feel from what compromises I'm making in order to be able to really commit to this?' So when you do commit, like, you are all in, and I think that's an amazingly valuable approach that women have when they come back to work and quality that they have when they come back to work.\" As more parents and companies start talking about the \"fifth trimester,\" Brody hopes people will come to understand that this transitional time exists and presents a host of challenges but also that women can get through it and come out stronger in every way. \"For me, I found that it was really helpful also to understand that the transition was finite and that when I got to the other side of it, I would actually see, really clearly see all of the ways in which I was a better editor, a better employee, a better manager and leader.\" For any women who are adjusting to the return to work or who have gone through it, Brody hopes they'll be open about their experiences. She says she wants every woman to do what works for them emotionally but hopes they realize that the more open they are, the better off we'll all be. See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \"If you are just open about what is challenging in this transition, about the fact that it is probably too soon (to return to work) if you feel that way, but then also about the fact that look at this, you are still getting your job done ... and even the things you're struggling through, you're going to get through it, look back and see that you made it through and came out stronger,\" she said.  \"I hope the book gives new moms the courage to be honest and open about the challenges of new working motherhood, so that even when you're struggling, you are doing a greater good by educating your workplace -- and shifting workplace culture for the better. \"More than anything, it's important to be transparent about the challenges but also about the triumphs. ... That will also help everyone be less afraid of it, both of going through it and managing people who are going through it.\" What do you think is the best way to help new moms when they return to work?

In brief: Some have suggested solar geoengineering \u2014 the injection of aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from the planet \u2014 as a way to counter global warming. However, new research suggests the radical process could do as much harm as good. Solar Geoengineering A new report suggests that geoengineering \u2014 intentionally manipulating the climate on a large scale to combat the effects of global warming \u2014 might have its own ruinous effect on the planet. Research led by scientists at the University of Exeter indicates that targeted solar geoengineering in one hemisphere might have a negative impact on conditions in the other hemisphere. Their research has been published in Nature Communications. The idea of solar geoengineering is fairly straightforward. By injecting aerosols into the atmosphere, we could reflect sunlight away from the planet, thereby cooling its surface. This would mimic the effect of aerosols that are naturally emitted into the atmosphere following a volcanic eruption. Drones are fighting wildfires in some very surprising ways For their research, the University of Exeter scientists conducted advanced simulations using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. Their results suggest that injecting aerosols into the Northern Hemisphere would decrease the number of tropical cyclones found in the North Atlantic. However, carrying out the same process in the Southern Hemisphere would increase the rate of these events. Furthermore, an effort to reduce the amount of cyclones in the North Atlantic could prompt droughts in the Sahel, a region in Africa. \u201cOur results confirm that regional solar geoengineering is a highly risky strategy which could simultaneously benefit one region to the detriment of another,\u201d said Anthony Jones, lead author of the paper, in a university news release. \u201cIt is vital that policymakers take solar geoengineering seriously and act swiftly to install effective regulation.\u201d Calculated Risk Not all scientists share Jones\u2019 reservations about solar geoengineering, however. Ken Caldeira is a climate scientist in the Carnegie Institution for Science, and he believes that the procedure is relatively innocuous based on the underlying science alone. \u201cIf you really trusted the models\u2026and were just worried about the physical climate systems and not about the social and political ramifications, you would just go ahead and do it,\u201d Caldeira told Futurism. \u201cThe reasons you wouldn\u2019t do it are you\u2019re concerned about the social and political ramifications, you\u2019re afraid that the models might be missing something important, or both.\u201d According to Caldeira, if geoengineering were interpreted as a kind of magic bullet that could provide a quick fix for global warming, humanity would have even less reason to change its behavior. It\u2019s a method of counteracting certain effects, but it\u2019s not a means of addressing the underlying issues. Dennis L. Hartmann, a professor in the University of Washington\u2019s department of atmospheric sciences, further emphasized the fact that geoengineering is far from a quick fix for climate change. \u201cSolar radiation management would have to be sustained and increased to offset increased greenhouse gas warming,\u201d he told Futurism. \u201cIf the solar radiation management is halted for any reason, then a rapid warming would result, with likely catastrophic consequences.\u201d According to Caldeira, solar geoengineering alone is unlikely to have a disastrous effect on the planet. If we were to ramp up to the amount of material introduced to the atmosphere when Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991 by 2100, we could likely offset projected levels of global warming for this century, he said, noting that that eruption didn\u2019t cause climate chaos. Still, the best course of action is taking stock of how human activity is affecting our environment and making some much-needed changes\u2014 a process that will be neither quick nor easy. \"There's a Radical Plan to Artificially Cool the Planet by Mimicking Volcanic Eruptions\" was originally published by Futurism, LLC on Nov. 16, 2017 by Brad Jones.

The New York Times has obtained a copy of the president\u2019s remarks. Check against delivery. Fellow plutocrats! I know you\u2019re as glad to see me as I am to see you. No, really. Like, I know you voted for Trump. Or maybe you didn\u2019t vote for me, because your wives, if you had voted for me, they\u2019d withhold sex. But, when I won, in your hearts, you were very happy. And now you\u2019re all so much richer, and your wives, girlfriends, boyfriends, whatever \u2014 I\u2019m a very tolerant person \u2014 they aren\u2019t withholding, probably. Am I right? I\u2019m right. It\u2019s been an amazing, amazing year. The New York Times, such losers! Right after I won, they predicted the stock market would never recover. Every week, it\u2019s Trump is destroying this, Trump is blowing up that, and has the world ended yet? Yet here we are, folks. No. 1 in fake news, the failing Times. As I said, you\u2019re all doing very, very well. The markets are up, up, up, like never before. Seven, eight trillion dollars in market cap since Trump was elected. Biggest tax cut in history, believe me. Apple, Google, Microsoft, all these companies bringing home trillions in overseas cash. How\u2019s your share price doing? If you have a problem with it, let\u2019s have a show of hands. No hands. Thought so. I couldn\u2019t help but notice on my way in how much snow you\u2019ve got here in Davos, five, six feet. Global warming, uh-huh. When it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s global warming, and when it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s climate change. It\u2019s like, heads I win, tails you lose. But people aren\u2019t stupid. That\u2019s why I took the United States out of that terrible Paris deal. Rex Tillerson, who\u2019s doing a terrific job as secretary of state, he said, \u201cMr. President, you just can\u2019t pull out like that! What about our allies?\u201d O.K., maybe Rex isn\u2019t doing such a terrific job, we\u2019ll see about Rex. Anyway, I know you all have your climate plans and corporate social responsibility B.S., but none of you believes a word of it. The difference between us is that you keep quiet so that you\u2019ll look good at Davos, but I don\u2019t. I say all the stuff you\u2019re too afraid to say. I say the truth, and people love me. I also say that Haiti is a, well, not such a nice place. Let\u2019s have another show of hands if you plan to move your wife and kids to Haiti anytime soon. I didn\u2019t think so. Wonderful, hard-working people, by the way, the Haitians. Many of them work at my properties in Florida as groundskeepers, maids, that kind of stuff. Ask them, they love me too. So what am I doing here? I read the papers \u2014 believe me, I read, I\u2019m, like, the best reader, you know I went to Wharton? \u2014 and I know this is all supposed to be about how you\u2019re all Davos Men and I\u2019m Mr. America First, and it\u2019s, you know, never the twain shall meet. Whatever. We\u2019re businessmen. We think the same way. You want to turn a profit and beat the competition. You don\u2019t want to get crushed. And you\u2019ll do what you need to do and say what you need to say to win. That\u2019s the way the world is, folks. You think China doesn\u2019t know this? You think Russia \u2014 and you know this Russia story, collusion, there was no collusion, none \u2014 doesn\u2019t know? Why do you think they keep winning? China is getting bigger, stronger, while Europe just gets smaller and weaker. Angela Merkel, sorry, but she\u2019s a total joke. Lets in a million Muslims, illegals, terrorists probably, in one year, and the German people don\u2019t like it at all. Remember, a year ago, how it was like, \u201cMerkel is the real leader of the free world\u201d? Now she barely leads her own government. She should have built a wall. Not smart! Anyway, China. Last year, Xi \u2014 we have a terrific relationship, by the way, Xi and I, but he could be a lot better on North Korea, believe me \u2014 Xi was here in Davos, saying he was, like, Mr. Globalization. And everyone was like, ooh, ahh, China\u2019s taking over, and adios America. You have got to be kidding me. Have any of you here had your trade secrets stolen by China? Any of you think the Chinese play fair? You like human rights in China, pollution in China? Do some of you want to live in a world run by Xi? Because, be my guest. But if you don\u2019t, then things have to change. It can\u2019t be, we\u2019ll play by all the rules, like a bunch of little girls, and China gets to cheat, and pretend that that\u2019s O.K. Because, believe me, cheaters always win. Nobody knows this better than me. So that has got to stop. That\u2019s my message to you people. Do you want America first or China first? I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s your choice. But if it\u2019s America first you want, then you\u2019re going to stop playing us for suckers. We aren\u2019t going to pay your bills while you take our jobs. We aren\u2019t going to fight your battles if you aren\u2019t going to buy our products. We aren\u2019t going to let you get rich off of us, if we can\u2019t get richer off of you. We\u2019re stronger than you and we\u2019re going to stay that way. We can leave the surrender stuff to our European friends. Got it? You want America to be nice, we can be very nice, I\u2019m very nice, isn\u2019t that right, Klaus? But, we\u2019re not stupid, believe me. Enjoy your snow day, people.

Photo illustration by Delcan & Company. Balloons by Jenue & Laura Ortega. Feature layer innocent nothing argue pottery winner cotton menu task slim merge maid The sequence of words is meaningless: a random array strung together by an algorithm let loose in an English dictionary. What makes them valuable is that they\u2019ve been generated exclusively for me, by a software tool called MetaMask. In the lingo of cryptography, they\u2019re known as my seed phrase. They might read like an incoherent stream of consciousness, but these words can be transformed into a key that unlocks a digital bank account, or even an online identity. It just takes a few more steps. On the screen, I\u2019m instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters: 1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66 This is what\u2019s called a \u201cprivate key\u201d in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there\u2019s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location. That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string: 0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9 That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data, that record is called the blockchain. The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I\u2019ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness. And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum\u2019s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened. Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \u201ccoin\u201d of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later. You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn\u2019t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment? But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it\u2019s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook. The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet\u2019s roots. Once the inspiration for utopian dreams of infinite libraries and global connectivity, the internet has seemingly become, over the past year, a universal scapegoat: the cause of almost every social ill that confronts us. Russian trolls destroy the democratic system with fake news on Facebook; hate speech flourishes on Twitter and Reddit; the vast fortunes of the geek elite worsen income equality. For many of us who participated in the early days of the web, the last few years have felt almost postlapsarian. The web had promised a new kind of egalitarian media, populated by small magazines, bloggers and self-organizing encyclopedias; the information titans that dominated mass culture in the 20th century would give way to a more decentralized system, defined by collaborative networks, not hierarchies and broadcast channels. The wider culture would come to mirror the peer-to-peer architecture of the internet itself. The web in those days was hardly a utopia \u2014 there were financial bubbles and spammers and a thousand other problems \u2014 but beneath those flaws, we assumed, there was an underlying story of progress. Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \u201cWe have to fix the internet,\u201d Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cAfter 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\u201d The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \u201cThe dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\u201d In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \u201cPublishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google\u2019s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\u201d (Full disclosure: Burnham\u2019s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \u201cmisinformation, or \u2018fake news,\u2019 which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.\u201d For most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft\u2019s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft\u2019s dominant position. The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today\u2019s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons. That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure. To some students of modern technological history, the internet\u2019s fall from grace follows an inevitable historical script. As Tim Wu argued in his 2010 book, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d all the major information technologies of the 20th century adhered to a similar developmental pattern, starting out as the playthings of hobbyists and researchers motivated by curiosity and community, and ending up in the hands of multinational corporations fixated on maximizing shareholder value. Wu calls this pattern the Cycle, and on the surface at least, the internet has followed the Cycle with convincing fidelity. The internet began as a hodgepodge of government-funded academic research projects and side-hustle hobbies. But 20 years after the web first crested into the popular imagination, it has produced in Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and indirectly, Apple \u2014 what may well be the most powerful and valuable corporations in the history of capitalism. Blockchain advocates don\u2019t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties. To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet\u2019s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade. The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don\u2019t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don\u2019t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don\u2019t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don\u2019t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history. To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts. But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky. But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation. The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo. For all their brilliance, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the internet failed to include some key elements that would later prove critical to the future of online culture. Perhaps most important, they did not create a secure open standard that established human identity on the network. Units of information could be defined \u2014 pages, links, messages \u2014 but people did not have their own protocol: no way to define and share your real name, your location, your interests or (perhaps most crucial) your relationships to other people online. This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know. The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation. If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power. But the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better. One of the most persuasive advocates of an open-protocol revival is Juan Benet, a Mexican-born programmer now living on a suburban side street in Palo Alto, Calif., in a three-bedroom rental that he shares with his girlfriend and another programmer, plus a rotating cast of guests, some of whom belong to Benet\u2019s organization, Protocol Labs. On a warm day in September, Benet greeted me at his door wearing a black Protocol Labs hoodie. The interior of the space brought to mind the incubator/frat house of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d its living room commandeered by an array of black computer monitors. In the entrance hallway, the words \u201cWelcome to Rivendell\u201d were scrawled out on a whiteboard, a nod to the Elven city from \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d \u201cWe call this house Rivendell,\u201d Benet said sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very good Rivendell. It doesn\u2019t have enough books, or waterfalls, or elves.\u201d Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype. Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201d Protocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come. Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders. And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you. Running Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore. So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo. The first hint of a meaningful challenge to the closed-protocol era arrived in 2008, not long after Zuckerberg opened the first international headquarters for his growing company. A mysterious programmer (or group of programmers) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto circulated a paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper was called \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\u201d and in it, Nakamoto outlined an ingenious system for a digital currency that did not require a centralized trusted authority to verify transactions. At the time, Facebook and Bitcoin seemed to belong to entirely different spheres \u2014 one was a booming venture-backed social-media start-up that let you share birthday greetings and connect with old friends, while the other was a byzantine scheme for cryptographic currency from an obscure email list. But 10 years later, the ideas that Nakamoto unleashed with that paper now pose the most significant challenge to the hegemony of InternetTwo giants like Facebook. The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain. History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features. First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data. Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201d For our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter. These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune. These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O. The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network. Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201d Pseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses. Let\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, that the hype is warranted, and blockchain platforms like Ethereum become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure. How would a distributed ledger and a token economy somehow challenge one of the tech giants? One of Fred Wilson\u2019s partners at Union Square Ventures, Brad Burnham, suggests a scenario revolving around another tech giant that has run afoul of regulators and public opinion in the last year: Uber. \u201cUber is basically just a coordination platform between drivers and passengers,\u201d Burnham says. \u201cYes, it was really innovative, and there were a bunch of things in the beginning about reducing the anxiety of whether the driver was coming or not, and the map \u2014 and a whole bunch of things that you should give them a lot of credit for.\u201d But when a new service like Uber starts to take off, there\u2019s a strong incentive for the marketplace to consolidate around a single leader. The fact that more passengers are starting to use the Uber app attracts more drivers to the service, which in turn attracts more passengers. People have their credit cards stored with Uber; they have the app installed already; there are far more Uber drivers on the road. And so the switching costs of trying out some other rival service eventually become prohibitive, even if the chief executive seems to be a jerk or if consumers would, in the abstract, prefer a competitive marketplace with a dozen Ubers. \u201cAt some point, the innovation around the coordination becomes less and less innovative,\u201d Burnham says. The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train. How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft. As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value. \u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201d Even decentralized cryptomovements have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. \u201cHow can we fix the internet if we can\u2019t even make coffee?\u201d she said with a laugh. Planted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems. The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same). The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet. What would prevent a new blockchain-based identity standard from following Tim Wu\u2019s Cycle, the same one that brought Facebook to such a dominant position? Perhaps nothing. But imagine how that sequence would play out in practice. Someone creates a new protocol to define your social network via Ethereum. It might be as simple as a list of other Ethereum addresses; in other words, Here are the public addresses of people I like and trust. That way of defining your social network might well take off and ultimately supplant the closed systems that define your network on Facebook. Perhaps someday, every single person on the planet might use that standard to map their social connections, just as every single person on the internet uses TCP/IP to share data. But even if this new form of identity became ubiquitous, it wouldn\u2019t present the same opportunities for abuse and manipulation that you find in the closed systems that have become de facto standards. I might allow a Facebook-style service to use my social map to filter news or gossip or music for me, based on the activity of my friends, but if that service annoyed me, I\u2019d be free to sample other alternatives without the switching costs. An open identity standard would give ordinary people the opportunity to sell their attention to the highest bidder, or choose to keep it out of the marketplace altogether. Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201d The token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201d Would that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201d Additional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201d So much of the blockchain\u2019s architecture is shaped by predictions about how that architecture might be abused once it finds a wider audience. That is part of its charm and its power. The blockchain channels the energy of speculative bubbles by allowing tokens to be shared widely among true supporters of the platform. It safeguards against any individual or small group gaining control of the entire database. Its cryptography is designed to protect against surveillance states or identity thieves. In this, the blockchain displays a familial resemblance to political constitutions: Its rules are designed with one eye on how those rules might be exploited down the line. Much has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age. The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state. Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago. Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone.

Sentell told Fox News that the former National Park Service director Jonathan Jarvis challenged him and other historians two years ago to create an inventory of surviving civil rights landmarks. Sentell turned to Georgia State University, who compiled a list of 60 sites and paved the foundation for the new U.S. Civil Rights Trail.  GSU researcher Dr. Glenn Eskew had already been collecting a list of locations that \u201cthe federal government, that state agencies, that local communities themselves identified as important civil rights sites\u201d for a separate project. A dozen state tourism directors, who are members of TravelSouth USA, supplemented the remaining locations to reach a total of 110. \u201c2018 is a very good year for equalizing the plight of humanity.\" Eskew says this list will continue to grow, adding that \u201cevery community has something because the fight took place in every community to alter America\u2019s oppressive racial system.\u201d  The trail highlights renowned historic sites like the recently expanded Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Park and King\u2019s birth home in Atlanta. The National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and the home of Medgar Evers, who was a voting rights activist assassinated just after President John Kennedy proposed civil rights legislation, also serve as anchors along the trail. But the tourism campaign is aimed at expanding people\u2019s scope of the era, thus also recognizing lesser-known sites that shaped the Civil Rights Movement. Howard High School of Technology made the list for its direct association to Brown v. Board of Education, which ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. In Kentucky, the birthplace of Whitney M. Young Jr. commemorates the civil rights leader\u2019s tireless work to end employment discrimination. \u201cThis movement didn\u2019t just happen in the cities, it happened all across the region,\u201d director of Georgia tourism Kevin Langston said. \u201cYou have to get out and see some of those sites off the main road to experience that.\u201d By providing this umbrella website, tourism directors hope to spark a domino effect in visitors\u2019 interest, getting tourists to not only cross state lines but oceans to learn more about the volatility in the 1950s and 1960s.", "The first NAACP field secretary Medgar Evers was assassinated at his home in 1963.

They crawl through labyrinths of equipment in utter darkness pierced only by their flashlights, listening for periodic explosions as hydrogen gas escaping from crippled reactors ignites on contact with air. They breathe through uncomfortable respirators or carry heavy oxygen tanks on their backs. They wear white, full-body jumpsuits with snug-fitting hoods that provide scant protection from the invisible radiation sleeting through their bodies. They are the faceless 50, the unnamed operators who stayed behind. They have volunteered, or been assigned, to pump seawater on dangerously exposed nuclear fuel, already thought to be partly melting and spewing radioactive material, to prevent full meltdowns that could throw thousands of tons of radioactive dust high into the air and imperil millions of their compatriots. The workers \u2014 and an increasing proportion of soldiers \u2014 struggled on Tuesday and Wednesday to keep hundreds of gallons of seawater a minute flowing through temporary fire pumps into the three stricken reactors, Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Among the many problems that officials acknowledged on Wednesday were what appeared to be yet another fire at the plant and indications that the containment vessel surrounding a reactor may have ruptured. That reactor, No. 3, appeared to be releasing radioactive steam. The reactor\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, said it had been able to double the number of people at the plant to 100 as a result of falling radiation levels, but that was before the sudden release of radioactive vapor. It was not immediately clear how many of the workers and soldiers at the plant might have evacuated after that. Those remaining are being asked to make escalating \u2014 and perhaps existential \u2014 sacrifices that so far are being only implicitly acknowledged: Japan\u2019s Health Ministry said Tuesday it was raising the legal limit on the amount of radiation to which each worker could be exposed, to 250 millisieverts from 100 millisieverts, five times the maximum exposure permitted for American nuclear plant workers. The change means that workers can now remain on site longer, the ministry said. \u201cIt would be unthinkable to raise it further than that, considering the health of the workers,\u201d the health minister, Yoko Komiyama, said at a news conference. There was also a suggestion on Wednesday that more workers may be brought to help save the power station. Tokyo Electric Power, the plant\u2019s operator, has said almost nothing at all about the workers, including how long a worker is expected to endure exposure. The few details  Tokyo  Electric has made available paint a dire picture. Five workers have died since the quake and 22 more have been injured for various reasons, while two are missing. One worker was hospitalized after suddenly grasping his chest and finding himself unable to stand, and another needed treatment after receiving a blast of radiation near a damaged reactor. Eleven workers were injured in a hydrogen explosion at reactor No. 3. Nuclear reactor operators say that their profession is typified by the same kind of esprit de corps found among firefighters and elite military units. Lunchroom conversations at reactors frequently turn to what operators would do in a severe emergency. The consensus is always that they would warn their families to flee before staying at their posts to the end, said Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at three American power plants for a total of 13 years. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly worried about the health and safety of your family, but you have an obligation to stay at the facility,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a sense of loyalty and camaraderie when you\u2019ve trained with guys, you\u2019ve done shifts with them for years.\u201d  Video  TimesCast | The Fight Against Disaster Hiroko Tabuchi reports on the workers inside the Fukushima plant and the Japanese government's relationship with Tokyo Electric Power Company.  By Ben Solomon|Jane Bornemeier on Publish Date March 15, 2011. . Watch in Times Video \u00bb  Adding to this natural bonding, jobs in Japan confer identity, command loyalty and inspire a particularly fervent kind of dedication. Economic straits have chipped away at the hallowed idea of lifetime employment for many Japanese, but the workplace remains a potent source of community. Mr. Friedlander said that he had no doubt that in an identical accident in the  United States , 50 volunteers could be found to stay behind after everyone else evacuated from an extremely hazardous environment. But Japanese are raised to believe that individuals sacrifice for the good of the group. The reactor operators face extraordinary risks. Tokyo Electric evacuated 750 emergency staff members from the stricken plant on Tuesday, leaving only about 50, when radiation levels soared. By comparison, standard staffing levels at the three active  General Electric  reactors on the site would be 10 to 12 people apiece including supervisors \u2014 an indication that the small crew left behind is barely larger than the contingent on duty on a quiet day. Daiichi is not synonymous with Chernobyl in terms of the severity of contamination. The Ukrainian reactor blew up and spewed huge amounts of radiation for 10 days in 1986. But workers at the plants have a bond. Among plant employees and firefighters at Chernobyl, many volunteered to try to tame, and then entomb, the burning reactor \u2014 although it is not clear that all were told the truth about the risks. Within three months, 28 of them died from radiation exposure. At least 19 of them were killed by infections that resulted from having large areas of their skin burned off by radiation, according to a recent report by a United Nations scientific committee. And 106 others developed  radiation sickness , with nausea,  vomiting ,  diarrhea  and dropping blood counts that left them highly vulnerable to infections. The people who had suffered radiation sickness developed other problems later, according to the report:  cataracts , severe scarring from the radiation burns to their skin and an increased number of deaths from leukemia and other blood cancers. Some of those Chernobyl workers were exposed to levels of radiation far beyond what has been measured to date at Daiichi \u2014 especially helicopter pilots who flew through radiation-laden smoke spewing from the reactor to drop fire-extinguishing chemicals on it. Radiation close to the reactors was reported to reach 400 millisieverts per hour on Tuesday after a blast inside reactor No. 2 and fire at reactor No. 4, but has since dropped back to as low as 0.6 millisieverts at the plant gate. Tokyo Electric and Japanese regulators have not released any statistics on radiation levels inside the containment buildings where engineers are desperately trying to fix electrical systems, pumps and other gear wrecked by Friday\u2019s earthquake and tsunami. But nuclear experts said that indoor radiation levels were likely to be higher because the containment buildings were probably still preventing most radiation from leaving the plant. The site is now so contaminated with radiation, experts say, that it has become difficult for employees to work near the reactors for extended periods of time. According to one expert\u2019s account of nuclear emergency procedures, workers would be cycled in and out of the worst-hit parts of the plant. In some cases, when dealing with a task in a highly radioactive area of the plant, workers might line up and handle the task only for minutes at a time before passing off to the next worker, said Katsuhiko Ishibashi, a former professor in the Research Center for Urban Safety and Security at  Kobe  University. Tokyo Electric has refused to release the names or any other information about the 50 workers who stayed behind, nor have utility executives said anything about how they are being relieved as they become tired or ill. Some of those battling flames and spraying water at reactors at Daiichi are members of Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Force, police officers or firefighters. Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa said Tuesday that Self-Defense Force soldiers might be called on to fly the helicopters Tokyo Electric may use to spray water onto the overheating used fuel storage pool at reactor No. 4. The same day, however, members of Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog group, who had been stationed about three miles from the plant, were moved to a site 18 miles away. (The authorities later said that using helicopters to put spray water on reactor No. 4 might not be feasible.) If the plant operator is limiting the exposure of each worker at Daiichi \u2014 and calling on hundreds of volunteers to make up the 50 on site at any given time \u2014 then Chernobyl may offer some consolation. To clean up the Chernobyl site after the accident, the Soviet Union conscripted workers in proportion to the size of each of its republics, and developed a system to limit their exposure. \u201cThey sent up to 600,000 people in to clean up the radioactive debris around the plant and build a sarcophagus,\u201d said Dr. John Boice, an author of the study, a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt and the scientific director of the International Epidemiology Institute in Rockvillle, Md. The workers were sent into contaminated zones for limited periods.

Many for-profit colleges get 80 percent, 90 percent, or more of their revenue from taxpayers. Taxpayers have a right to expect adequate performance and avoidance of waste, fraud, and abuse. Some for-profit schools do a good job. But there\u2019s enormous evidence that many for-profit schools, getting billions in federal aid, have engaged in deceptive and fraudulent practices and that many students have been left with terrible outcomes, including insurmountable debt. That\u2019s the problem. The Department had to act, and it did, with the gainful employment rule, and the 2016 borrower defense rule. Ms. Weisman told you this week you should get the rule right, because the Department should not have to start a new rulemaking any time soon to fix it, as it has many other regulatory issues to address. But that is what the Department is doing now: revisiting an issue it decided less than 15 months ago, and decided correctly, after listening carefully to all stakeholders. Secretary DeVos has claimed that under the 2016 rule \u201call one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money.\u201d That is not so. A student would have to show school misconduct, and relief would remain an uphill battle for many students who were in fact injured. School operators insist in this meeting essentially that former students would act as con artists, and exploit the rule to bring down good schools like theirs, even when the school leadership did nothing wrong. What kind of scam would that be? A student would have to put in all the hours of classes, studying, commuting; find child care; commit personal and family money, Pell grants, GI bill; and take out the high-interest private loans often needed to attend expensive schools. Most of that time and money would never be regained. All this alleged scam could achieve is possible cancellation of federal loans \u2014 far from the whole thing, and far from guaranteed. Look at the facts. Since the Department started taking borrower defense seriously after the collapse of Corinthian and ITT, it has received about 99,000 claims. 98.6 percent are from students who attended for-profit schools. Very few are from non-profit and public colleges. But also there are many for-profit schools where not a single student has filed for debt forgiveness. Students who attended good schools, it seems, are not seeking loan relief. For the owners who believe their schools are honest and effective, here\u2019s how you would avoid trouble under the 2016 rule: Be honest and effective. Don\u2019t set out to deceive or defraud students. Train your admissions staff to behave ethically. Offer a quality, valuable education at a fair price. There\u2019s no reason to believe the Department would create a kangaroo court and start rubber stamping phony student debt relief claims, or that the 2016 rule would force it to. No reason. All the 2016 rule does is give the student a fair chance to be heard. If a few students at a good school managed somehow to get their loans forgiven, taxpayers, not the school, would be on the hook for the money. Recoupment is in the Department\u2019s discretion. Only if the Department saw egregious or persistent wrongdoing would it likely come after the school, and the school would be able to defend itself. In that light, it seems clear that the 2016 rule is not a lucrative racket for crooked students at honest schools. Instead, it\u2019s basic protection for honest students at crooked schools. Compare that to the rule the Department proposed this week. Mr. McComis, who runs the leading for-profit college accreditor, told you that this proposal \u201cfeels a little stacked against the student.\u201d He described the multiple constraints to debt relief as \u201cbelts and suspenders on pants that are too tight.\u201d He added, \u201cI find it just not reasonable that a student would be able to achieve anything\u2026 If that\u2019s the intent, I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019re here.\u201d The draft rule would impose one of the toughest legal standards the government has ever required of a private party \u2013 and impose them on lower-income people who lack the means to meet the burdens, whatever the justice of their claims. The draft rule also would render the 1994 law a nullity. The Department doesn\u2019t have the power to do that. The Department does have the power to prohibit forced arbitration clauses as a condition of receiving Title IV aid, and I commend the Department lawyers who got that right the first time. The Justice Department\u2019s position on the Federal Arbitration Act is not on point. One last thing: The suggestion that stronger borrower relief is worse for taxpayers is short-sighted at best, dishonest at worst. If the Department granted injured students meaningful relief, it would soon have a stronger sense of the enormous costs of allowing bad schools to participate in the federal aid program, and it would remove the worst actors more quickly. I believe that\u2019s exactly what bad schools are afraid of. Good schools should want a strong borrower defense rule that drives out unscrupulous competitors, the ones who have given the for-profit college industry its bad reputation. All of you, I hope, got into the education field because you believed in the power of learning to lift people up and change lives. If you stay true to those beliefs, the best course is to reject proposals that, in truth, slam the door on abused students. The existing rule can work, and would protect students, taxpayers, and good schools. You should reaffirm that rule.

Credit Stephen B. Morton for The New York Times", "You\u2019ve found a home that suits you in terms of price, location and design, and you\u2019ve decorated it in a style that reflects your personal aesthetic. All should be good, right? Well, not if your furniture is a pain in the neck, back, hips or shoulders. When Jennifer and Roland Palmer bought a second home in Hilton Head, S.C., they wanted to furnish it stylishly, but they were even more concerned with comfort: Mr. Palmer, who is 70, had a few aches and pains and, at six feet, is taller than his wife by a foot. So Ms. Palmer, 44, ordered seating in custom sizes \u2014 his and hers \u2014 from Ekornes, a Norwegian company that specializes in ergonomic design. Now, she said, she can\u2019t bear to sit in the furniture back home in Michigan. \u201cUp there, I have to sit with my legs tucked underneath me, because the chairs and sofa are so big,\u201d she said. \u201cI end up getting sore in certain positions. But in the new furniture, the way your body is supported, you don\u2019t have your muscles being pulled.\u201d Unlike office furnishings, which tend to adhere to basic ergonomic or body-friendly principles, home d\u00e9cor can be surprisingly bad for your musculoskeletal health. The result is various strains, aches and pains that no amount of yoga and Pilates can undo. \u201cWhen people decorate their homes, it\u2019s all about what looks good, fits in the space, matching colors, with no thought to how it will impact their body,\u201d said Margo Fraser, a kinesiologist and ergonomics consultant in Calgary, Alberta. \u201cAnd then they mistakenly attribute their pain and discomfort to getting older or an exercise injury, when it\u2019s really their furniture.\u201d Buying furniture \u2014 specifically sofas and chairs, with which you are going to have extended bodily contact \u2014 should be like buying shoes. You can have your showpieces that are collectible, sculptural or fashionable, just like that pair of Manolo Blahniks. But to truly relax, what you need is seating that fits you as well as a pair of running shoes, with the right amount of support and cushion. Finding what is best for your body, however, can be a challenge, given the way home furnishings are made and marketed today. As a culture, we have come to equate comfort with a big, squishy seating experience in which you are swaddled, if not swallowed, in plush. \u201cI call it the sit-and-sink style, which over time is going to cause you real problems,\u201d said Alan Hedge, a professor in the department of design and environmental analysis at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. Regardless of your age, health or flexibility, he said, sinking into a cushy sofa or chair pulls down on your spine and pelvis, causing strain. And this is exacerbated by the effort required to get in and out of the pillowy abyss. While you may not feel it immediately, day-in and day-out, it can prove injurious. Apart from the Scandinavian companies Ekornes and Fjords, few manufacturers make truly ergonomic, supportive home seating. If you\u2019re not into the no-nonsense Nordic look, though, there are other options. You can find spine-friendly furniture in a range of styles, if you keep a few fundamental rules in mind. First, you want firm. \u201cNot hard like a wooden bench,\u201d said John Dunnigan, the head of the department of furniture design at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. \u201cBut firm cushioning that will support you over a range of compression,\u201d because your body will have various contact points that exert more or less downward pressure.", "Make Yourself Comfortable Credit Herman Miller", "Mr. Dunnigan recommended looking for furniture with a foam-density rating (a measurement indicating the amount of weight the foam can support over a cubic foot) of at least 2.4, or hand-tied coil springs, which can be found in some antiques and higher-end furniture. Examples include seating from the Federal or midcentury periods, when styles were more tailored, slim and firm. You can find similarly supportive contemporary looks from manufacturers like Natuzzi, R. Jones and Poltrona Frau. In addition to firm, you want furniture that holds you in an upright position, vertically aligning your ears over your shoulders over your hips, said Dr. David Rempel, a professor of medicine and bioengineering at the University of California, San Francisco and Berkeley. \u201cResting your back against the back support, you should be able to rest your feet flat on the floor,\u201d he said, with your knees at a 90- to 110-degree angle to your hips. Moreover, there should be some space between the edge of the seat and the back of your knee, so you don\u2019t have pressure on the veins and arteries there. Of course, the right height and depth vary from person to person, because we are all different statures and girths, so you need to try furniture in the showroom (sit for at least 20 minutes, experts suggest) or else be prepared to pay the charges to send it back if you choose to order online. \u201cA lot of chairs and sofas I see put you in the same terrible position you are in fancy sports cars, where you\u2019re cocked back, sitting low to the ground, with your legs out in front of you,\u201d said Laurie Johnson, a physical therapist in Houston who frequently finds that her patients\u2019 furniture causes or aggravates their musculoskeletal issues. \u201cThat pulls on your hamstring and sciatic nerve, and transfers all that tension to your back.\u201d Design Within Reach, Room and Board and SmartFurniture.com certainly sell some furniture that will put you in that awkward pose, but they are also among the few retailers that have some options that won\u2019t. They offer custom-made pieces, too. You might also have good luck shopping at stores that sell office furniture. Often, couches and lounge chairs made for corporate environments by manufacturers like Knoll and Herman Miller are both attractive and ergonomically sound. Another piece of advice from ergonomic and physiology experts: Choose and arrange your furniture according to what you will be using it for most often. If you like to binge-watch television, a supportive chair that reclines to take pressure off your back and neck or a firm sofa that allows full extension of your body in a reclining position might be the ticket, provided you put the television where you don\u2019t have to turn or crane your neck up or down to see it. Avid readers would do well to choose upright chairs that support the lower back, as well as some surface \u2014 even just a large pillow \u2014 on which to rest their books. Otherwise, you will stress your arms and put strain on your neck and shoulders looking down at the page. Knitters, on the other hand, might want a firm chair with armrests that support their elbows so they don\u2019t have to slouch or shrug their shoulders while knitting. If your living space will be where friends gather for lively or intimate conversation, then consider chairs that pivot or arrange the furniture in a circle so guests don\u2019t have to twist around to face each other. \u201cThe spine is a series of bones stacked up on each other like a column of blocks,\u201d said Dr. Hedge of Cornell. \u201cSo if you twist, what you\u2019re doing is twisting position of bone relative to other bone and asking for back pain and disc problems.\u201d Twisting and craning also happen when people use mobile devices, torquing the spine to use a laptop beside them on the couch or curving the neck downward while texting on a mobile phone. \u201cWhen you focus your eyes on your device, your body is going to follow, often into an unhealthy position,\u201d said Mark Goetz, a furniture designer in Brooklyn who designed the supportive Goetz sofa for Herman Miller. \u201cThink of your head as a heavy bowling ball. If it gets out of alignment looking at your cellphone, it\u2019s going to cause tremendous tension and strain.\u201d So make sure you sit without undue slouching or bodily torque, he said. And use armrests, pillows or other props to raise your devices to eye level. Furniture is like any other kind of equipment: It\u2019s most effective when you use it properly \u2014 and when you don\u2019t overuse it. \u201cOur bodies are not meant to watch television four hours straight,\u201d said Ms. Johnson, the physical therapist. \u201cGet up and move every once in a while.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on May 24, 2015, on Page RE4 of the New York edition with the headline: Seating as Comfortable as Running Shoes ."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

USA TODAY Sports", "The Milwaukee Brewers won\u2019t be confused with the Little Sisters of the Poor anymore. After opening each of the last two seasons with one of the five lowest payrolls in the majors as they rebuilt the team, the Brewers pulled off two stunning and expensive moves Thursday to bolster their outfield. Milwaukee fans were still rejoicing over the acquisition of sweet-swinging outfielder Christian Yelich from the Miami Marlins in a trade for four prospects when word came down the Brewers had signed free agent outfielder Lorenzo Cain to a five-year, $80 million contract. In an offseason bereft of much activity, the Brewers sent shockwaves through the industry with their sudden derring-do. Cain\u2019s deal is the largest signed so far this offseason. The total investment of $123.25 million for the two outfielders \u2014 Yelich is due $43.25 million over the next four seasons \u2014 is not much below the $130 million in Opening Day payrolls the Brewers had combined in 2016 and 2017. They\u2019ve also reportedly made a multi-year offer for Yu Darvish, considered the top free agent starting pitcher available. This is not the usual m.o. for a small-market team like the Brewers, but their unexpected success last season \u2014 when the club improved by 13 games and challenged for a wild-card spot before finishing at 86-76 \u2014 clearly convinced its brass to shift from rebuilding to loading up. After the trade for Yelich, general manager David Stearns told news reporters, \u201cBoth offensively and defensively, we view him as a player who can contribute to a championship-caliber team. We think he has proven that over his young career and we expect him to continue to do so.\u2019\u2019 The inclusion of the word \u201cchampionship\u2019\u2019 in Stearns\u2019 statement may come as a surprise to those who view the Chicago Cubs, the two-time defending NL Central champions, as the division\u2019s powerhouse, and the St. Louis Cardinals as their logical challengers. After winding up in second place in 2017, the Brewers clearly have other ideas. The biggest question remains whether they\u2019ll have enough pitching, especially with staff ace Jimmy Nelson likely out until at least midseason following shoulder surgery in September. Right-handers Chase Anderson, Zach Davies and newcomer Jhoulys Chacin currently head the rotation. Thursday\u2019s transactions leave the impression the club will try to address its pitching holes by dealing from its surplus of outfielders. Milwaukee got decent production from its outfielders last season, with starters Domingo Santana, Keon Broxton and Ryan Braun combining for 67 home runs. Santana finally had the breakout season long expected of him, batting .278 with 30 homers, 85 RBI and an .875 OPS. At 25, he seemed like a foundation piece for years to come, but he has been the subject of trade rumors this offseason and now appears certain to be dealt for pitching. Braun, with three years and $60 million left on his contract, likely isn\u2019t going anywhere, and Broxton won\u2019t bring back as high a return as Santana. Top prospect Lewis Brinson was sent to Miami as part of the package for Yelich, but lefty-swinging Brett Phillips is still available. He may want to keep a close eye on his cell phone.

(Henry Burroughs/Associated Press)  In 1973, attorney John Dean sat before the Senate Watergate Committee and recounted the grimy details of the scandal that brought Richard Nixon's presidency to a premature end. Dean ultimately pored over 600 hours of secretly recorded White House tapes and admitted he had been involved in strategic conversations about illegal activity. During the final months of Nixon's presidency, Dean testified against the commander in chief \u2014 words that helped end a presidency. Dean was granted immunity for his testimony, but still landed in prison. Now, 44 years later, the man who experienced presidential scandal up close says he has a case of deja vu. Dean said in an interview aired Friday that President Trump's first month in office \u2014 with its anti-media tirades and efforts to use intelligence agencies for political purposes \u2014 has \u201cechoes of Watergate.\u201d  I have expertise on this matter.

He has been a longtime Trump critic. And he has said that President George W. Bush should have been impeached. In fact, the title of Dean's 2004 book is \u201cWorse Than Watergate: The Secret Presidency of George W. Bush.\u201d But Dean said he sees a Nixonian patina in how Trump's administration has tried to get the U.S. intelligence community to play down alleged ties with Russia. This week, several news agencies reported that the administration asked senior members of the intelligence community to counter stories about Trump associates' ties to Russia. According to The Washington Post's Greg Miller and Adam Entous, the calls were made after FBI officials refused to do that. Dean isn't the only Trump critic who has made this comparison.

As details of Nixon's interactions with intelligence officials seeped out, Dean said the president tried to cover up what happened, which caused even more damage. \u201cWhat it did is it caught Richard Nixon in a lie, because he had denied he had known anything about any cover up until I told him much later, when I started having direct dealings with him,\u201d Dean said. \u201cAnd it was the lie that caught him more than that particular incident.\u201d Dean also said Trump's sour opinion of the media rivals Nixon's.

Dean said \u201cNixon made those kind of comments, that we only know about because he had his secret taping system running and seemed to forget it was on just constantly when he was in the office. \u201cIt would automatically go on. And he\u2019d make those kind of attacks against the media, calling the media the enemy, saying that he was going to wiretap them and surveil them to find out who was leaking.\u201d In his interview, Dean delves into a bigger question: If Trump has so many parallels with Nixon, will his presidency end in similar fashion? \u201cThe House and Senate are controlled by the Republicans, they\u2019re not going to impeach their president,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as he gives them what they want and signs into legislation or signs into law a lot of the things that they\u2019ve had in their dreams for many years, they\u2019re not going to give him any problem. \u2026 \u201cImpeachment is not a legal process. It\u2019s a quasi-legal process, but it\u2019s primarily a political process. And we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Read more:"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Bonneville Speedway, Utah (CNN) \"Wanna go for a ride?\" The Speed King's son poses the question as the early dawn paints pastels along the horizon and sends light dancing on the vast shimmering flatness that hot rod racers call the Great White Dyno.  His moment has arrived, at last. It took all of his 66 years and every penny he had to resurrect his father's old streamliner and race here at Speed Week. The annual event -- weather permitting -- sends some 500 hot rods, roadsters, motorcycles and their drivers ripping down a dried-up lake bed encrusted in salt. All in hot pursuit of national speed records.  And that is why, while most eyes were on the Olympic Games and the feats of Michael Phelps, Katie Ledecky and Simone Biles, I followed Danny Thompson to the salt flats of Utah to witness his day of reckoning.  It's not the Indianapolis 500 or NASCAR, but Bonneville has found its niche among purists who recall the day when cars ran on grease and testosterone. Each year a few thousand spectators and participants drive campers and trailers onto the salt and set up tents, tarps and lawn chairs.  Most come every year. Flush regulars book digs in the casino hotels in two nearby towns along the Nevada state line.  Read More The beverage of choice is bottled water, which a person can chug all day long without needing a portable john. That's what salt, triple-digit temperatures, relentless sun and 14% humidity does to the human body.  Nothing can survive long in the salt. A lone grasshopper spotted in a trash can clearly wasn't from around here and likely wouldn't make it. Cell phone service? Internet? Forget about it. The salt sucks the life out of everything. It gets in your eyes, under your nails, up your nostrils and on the back of your tongue. It coats your skin and stings. A small blister can blow up in a matter of minutes.  The harsh environment is part of the draw. It's like going to a beach without a shoreline. Regulars line key sections of the course, even though the view from the sidelines offers little more than sound. Up close, high performance engines set your ears ringing but from a distance tend to hum like a hive of angry bees.  By the time you hear the bees, a car going 400 mph has already passed. But if you anticipate the whine, use binoculars and look far down the course, you might see a blip -- followed by a plume of salt spun out by the back tires. Racers call it the rooster tail.  And so, when Thompson invited me into the pit and asked if I wanted to come along as he drove the course, scouting the salt conditions a couple of hours before his run, it was a no-brainer.  Wanna go for a ride? Yes, please.", "Danny Thompson has been waiting for decades to finish what his father started. Thompson, as it turns out, is the man to watch at the 68th running of Speed Week. Other drivers have a chance to go 400+ mph, but he's the one fans and other racers are cheering for. He's going for the record in memory of his dad, Mickey Thompson, the Speed King.  Mickey is long gone, murdered by a hit man hired by a business partner enraged over something that no longer matters. But here they are, father and son, together again at Bonneville.  And they are together. On the headrest behind the driver's seat of Challenger 2, Danny Thompson's speeding bullet of a car, the letters are carefully stitched: \"Drivers: Mickey * Danny.\"  Mickey may no longer be in the driver's seat, but he still gets top billing. The names of all the Thompsons -- Mickey; his dad, Marion, a cop; Danny; his mom, Judy; his wife, Valerie, and their son Travis -- are painted on the side of Challenger 2, proof that finishing the job Mickey started is, indeed, a family affair. Even 86-year-old Judy pitched in at the pit. Early this Saturday morning, Thompson sports the red cap given members of Bonneville's 200 mph club. He's hoping by Sunday afternoon to replace it with the black cap that designates an even more elite group -- the 400 mph club. How elite? Only 11 men have gone that fast at Bonneville.  Thompson aims to become The Twelfth Man.  Not everyone can go home with a land speed record, of course, but he is determined to settle some unfinished family business. He's here to go faster than anyone has gone before in a piston-engine car.  That includes his father, who went 406.6 mph in 1960, the first American to top 400 mph. That feat brought Mickey Thompson fame, which he used to amass a fortune making high performance racing tires and putting on motocross shows.", "Challenger 2 is built on the chassis of the car Mickey Thompson assembled in 1968 but never got to race. At Bonneville you have to make the trip twice to enter the record books. You go straight out, foot to the floor, for 5 miles or more on the first day -- the down run. Then you do the same thing again on the next day: the return run. Your official time is the average of both speeds at the 5-mile mark.  Mickey Thompson was never able to accomplish that. His car broke down on the return leg. He tried in 1968, but rain stopped him. He was going to try a third time in 1988, this time teaming up with Danny, when a bullet stopped him forever.  Danny couldn't bear the thought of continuing the project alone, and so he put Challenger in storage. Half a century after his dad broke 400, he decided to go for the official recognition that comes with two successful runs. He spent nearly seven years working on the car, getting it just right.  And so, on a clear, hot weekend in mid-August, Thompson and a team of two-dozen people -- many working for free because the money's run out -- descend on Bonneville to finish the job. It has become a labor of love -- and the hardest thing they've ever done. The Great White Dyno As the morning sun sends long shadows scooting across the salt, we climb into my rented SUV and set out along the 8-mile course. I wonder what the car rental people would think if they knew a second-generation hot-rodder was behind the wheel.  Thompson doesn't just feel the need for speed; he feeds on it. In a couple of hours he will slide his wiry frame between two 2,500 horsepower engines crammed inside a blue aluminum tube -- one in front, one in back -- and hurtle across the flats, his backside just inches above the salt. He jokes that when he's driving the streamliner, he's the baloney in \"a 5,000-horsepower sandwich.\" Challenger 2 was engineered and built by Thompson and his friends on the chassis of the hot rod his dad built in 1968 but never got the chance to race. This time, they built a Challenger so powerful they decided to add winglets.  When he talks about what it's like to taste salt with a side of nitro fumes, Thompson goes to his happy place. \"That's good stuff!\" he exclaims, punctuating his speech with growls that mimic the sound made by a revving engine. He is prone to pump his fist and give up throaty \"hoo-yahs!\" Why do they call it the Great White Dyno? The Internet offers several explanations, but I like Thompson's:  \"Well, the great white is the whiteness of the salt, and a dynamometer is what you test engines on to see how much horsepower they have,\" he says. \"You can test your engines all you want on a machine, but when you get to the Great White Dyno and test it on the surface, you're in the real deal now. This is the greatest testing facility in the world.\"", "Like the light at Bonneville, Mickey Thompson's legacy has cast a long shadow over his son's career. As he gives me a short version of Bonneville racing 101, the sun bounces off the white expanse, creating a mirror-like mirage that seems to lift the mountains off the Earth's surface. They say the course at Bonneville rises just 6 inches from start to finish; it's so flat drivers say they can see a slight curve in the Earth.  Thompson didn't hotdog it as we made our way up the course. He drove slowly, deliberately, like a beat cop on patrol.  He found the salt softer and wetter than he'd hoped. When it's in good shape, the salt casts a bluish shimmer. But this year, there was brown mixed in, a sign that mud lurked just under the surface -- particularly at the end of the course, where the salty crust appeared to be just an inch thick in spots.  During the day, the hot sun draws the water to the surface, turning the salt to mush. When the surface hardens overnight, it becomes bumpy. The drivers call it \"popcorn.\" The texture is similar to the \"corn\" snow skiers encounter in the spring. It was going to be hard to break any records under such \"marginal\" conditions, Thompson thought. He scouted out the spot where he'd veer ever so slightly off the course as his streamliner slowed so he could avoid the rough spots. He hoped he'd be able to get off the starting line early, while the salt was still cool and at its slickest.  He was ready, more ready than he had ever been. But, he said with a shake of his head, \"You can't control Mother Nature.\" A rivalry is born  I met Danny Thompson in 2014, on the weekend he started both of Challenger 2's engines for the first time. Classic rock blasted on the speakers as I strolled into a warehouse in Huntington Beach, California, and found his office.  I met the regulars -- crew chief Lou Anderson and fabricator Frank Hanrahan, who both stuck by Thompson even when he couldn't make payroll. (Mickey Thompson once fell short on payroll and made up the difference gambling at a hotel casino near Bonneville.)  And I encountered photographer Holly Martin, a racer herself. She was in constant motion -- and she'd brought cookies. I didn't know it then, but she'd be our guide at Speed Week 2016, helping us zip from one end of the course to the other during Thompson's runs.  Back then, at the beginning, none of us knew that Thompson's date with destiny would take so long. As I sat down with him for the first time in his office, I couldn't miss a unique, handmade, in-your-face paperweight. It was the F-word, carved into a polished block of wood. I laughed out loud, a reaction that met with his approval. I told him I was just happy not to see girlie calendars hanging on the walls. Thompson was still recovering from a mishap: He'd spent the previous night and about $1,300 at the emergency room after accidentally drinking from a water bottle filled with nitro, the fuel that powers Challenger 2. It's highly toxic; he'd heaved most of it into the bushes. But it burned, and it can blind.  Thompson, pushing 64 at the time, is one tough bird. He thinks he's probably broken every bone in his body, so he didn't let a little poison spoil his big moment: He jumped into Challenger 2 wearing a gas mask, ready to start those engines.", "Two dozen people, many working for free because the money's run out, are helping Thompson finish the job. Of all the racers at his level at Bonneville, Thompson has probably made the fewest passes on the course, according to racing officials. But in Challenger 2, each run has flirted with the 400 mark. The car is a beast. Challenger 2 went 419 mph at Bonneville that summer but broke down on the return run. The following year, the rain came and the salt was in no condition for racing. Thompson packed up and hauled Challenger 2 home to Colorado. He continued to work out to stay in shape, getting up each morning at 3:30 and going to bed with the chickens. It's a schedule that softens the early mornings at the speedway.  And so, as Speed Week 2016 began, Thompson was working on his car at the pit long before the sun came up. The desert air is sweet and cool at that hour, the salt in the best condition it will be all day.  After our cruise of the course, he was ready for the starting line. Thompson didn't get the early time he'd hoped for. He'd be the last driver down the long course. The current overall record holder, George Poteet, would go first in his new, state-of-the-art, computerized Speed Demon II.  Speed Demon II competes in a different class than Challenger 2 at Speed Week. Thompson's car is an AA fuel streamliner, while Poteet's is a blown fuel streamliner. It includes a supercharger that blows air into the engine when it burns fuel, giving it more horsepower. Speed Demon II and a handful of other blown fuel streamliners have topped 400 mph, and Poteet holds the fastest record at Bonneville for all piston-engine classes: 437.183 set in 2013.  Poteet crashed the first Speed Demon at 370 mph in 2014. He thought about retiring. But, like Thompson, he found the pull of the salt too hard to resist.  Thompson says he wouldn't mind having a supercharger, but there's no room for one. Challenger 2 is already packed tight, every millimeter spoken for. He compensates with two engines and four-wheel drive.  It didn't take long to see that while Poteet had everybody's respect, Thompson was the sentimental favorite.  While they race in different engine classes, Thompson and Poteet are both after the same thing. Each wants to be the fastest man on the salt.  At the starting line The wait can be long as the cars move up to the starting line, a streak of orange liquid sprayed into the salt. Since it can be 140 degrees in the car, Thompson donned his fireproof racer's suit at the last minute. Wife Valerie applied tape over the earbuds that would connect him to his radio communications system.  Crew members stood over Thompson, holding umbrellas and making last-minute tweaks to the car. Anderson, the crew chief, snapped Thompson's helmet on and strapped him in. The Challenger's hatch closed. There was no turning back. Go time.", "Final adjustments are made as Thompson prepares to take on the course. When I first wrote about Thompson and Bonneville, a colleague recommended I check out Rachel Kushner's \"The Flamethrowers.\" The novel, which won the National Book Award, includes some great scenes of salt flat racing.  One passage in particular resonates deeply, where she describes seeing the cars leave the starting line and take off down the salt:  \"One after another I watched the scream, the careen, the rooster tail, the float, and then the shimmer and wink off the edge of horizon, gone. \"Careen, rooster tail, float, gone. \"Careen, float, gone.\" Thompson is pushed to the line. The engine roars, and then he is gone. \"Godspeed, DT,\" a crew member shouts.  \"Run! Go, go, go,\" photographer Martin yells as we scramble to our SUV and race along the course in pursuit of Thompson. She steers far to the outside of the salt, away from the track and the crowd, and opens it up.  We carry CB radios and fire extinguishers, and our floor mats are wrapped in trash bags to keep out the salt. We are still barreling along when the radio crackles: Thompson was going 411 mph at the official 5-mile mark and 416 out the back door as he exited the course.  With a speed faster than 392.5 -- the record set for his class in 2009 -- Thompson qualified for the return run. Even better, Challenger 2 was still in one piece.  Thompson told us he'd had a good run but that the salt was not in great shape. And, in the two years since he'd first run Challenger 2 here, he'd forgotten about a quirk in the steering. He almost ran off course before moving his hands slightly to compensate.  But he'd get to go again -- a first for him -- and he hoped to do better the next day.  Challenger 2 headed off to impound with the other qualifying vehicles, where crews have four hours to get their cars in shape for the return run under the watchful eyes of racing officials.  The down run had stressed the streamliner, and at impound the crew virtually took it apart and put it back together. They washed the salt and expended fuel off the aluminum body panels, tires, wheels -- even the engines -- with Windex and water.  It made for a long day, but it meant they would get another chance to hit the salt before dawn and do it all again.", "Bonneville comes to life at first light, when the salt is at its slickest. As the sun comes up on Sunday, Thompson and Poteet's cars stand side by side as they're prepped. Again, Speed Demon II would go first and Challenger 2 would go last.  Speed Demon II, a color somewhere between rust and brown, is tight, aerodynamic and even looks fast in the same mean way a wasp looks fast. It is a thing of beauty. The crew works on the car quietly and efficiency. They wear black T-shirts, projecting a tough image. There is a corporate air about them.  Poteet, who operates out of Memphis, Tennessee, is nowhere to be seen, arriving to hop into Speed Demon II just before it is towed to the starting line.  Thompson, on the other hand, is everywhere -- working on Challenger 2 himself in the pit, even pushing a broom to sweep the salt off the tarp that covers the ground. His car is a friendly royal blue, and his crew wears white T-shirts.  Hollywood scriptwriters could have a field day with this scene, pitting the ragtag band of underdogs in white against the highly efficient men in black. They could shape it as a classic battle: old school, handcrafted racing from the heart vs. the best technology money can buy.  Some kind of luck Thompson is the crowd pleaser. A circle of spectators form around him while the Speed Demon team has their space pretty much to themselves. Sniffs one spectator, \"George Poteet is a checkbook racer. Danny Thompson's the real racer. He's over there, working on his car, getting greasy. Where's George Poteet?\"  As Thompson's run time draws near, liquid can be seen dripping under the rear right side of Challenger 2. A crew member says it is likely just overflow, and Thompson decides to go anyway. He is out of time and out of money. This is his shot.  Martin and I position ourselves at the 5-mile mark this time. We see a speck approach, then flash by. We can't see much of a rooster tail. By the time we hear the zoom, Thompson's already gone.  Even the race officials in the timing tower are cheering him on. A video posted by an observer in the tower shows their reaction:  \"He's hauling ass,\" one official exclaims as the times are called out, mile by mile: 341.560 at the quarter mile, 356.170 at the two-mile mark, 385.963 at the three-mile mark.  \"Oh, baby, look at that rooster! C'mon, 400 baby, 400, 400, 400, 400.\"  \"Woo hoo!\" The cheer erupts in the tower as the 5-mile time is called out: 402.348.  \"Good boy.\" Averaged with his official down run mark of 411.191, Thompson's speed is 406.767. He beat Mickey's time by a tenth of a second. And it's official. He set a national record for fuel streamliners.", "The record sheet tells the tale: Thompson's return speed broke 400 mph. Sitting with Martin, my neutral reporter's stance is toast. My throat tightens and my eyes tear up as we head to the finish line, and I don't know why.  Perhaps I've become too invested in this mad dash and the people involved in it. But I needed them more than they needed me.  Perhaps we all needed Danny Thompson -- and Michael Phelps and Simone Biles and all the others -- to remind us what it means to be an American during this ugly, violent, divisive summer of 2016. We needed to see what it means to work on cars and spend hours in gyms and pools and on tracks to push the envelope just a little further.  We raced to the finish line, where we found Thompson already out of Challenger 2. Fire extinguishers were strewn around the salt, but they hadn't been needed. That liquid dripping under the rear right side? A fuel line had ruptured, and he'd been spewing a mist of fuel as he raced down the course.  Thompson said he lost power in the rear engine at about the 4-mile mark.  He recalled sending up a prayer: \"Please God, just one more mile to go.\" The front engine pulled him across the finish line on its own. It was enough for the record. Poteet's run on Sunday also topped 400 mph, but a slow first run meant his average two-day speed didn't break 400. For 24 hours of Speed Week 2016, at least, Thompson was King of the Salt. As he packed up on Monday, though, Poteet raged down the course again, setting another record at 429 mph.  But that was fine. Thompson may not have broken Poteet's overall record, but he'd accomplished what he'd come to do. He'd won his class and wrote the Thompson name into racing's record books. And, he joined Bonneville's elite 400 mph club. He's being called \"The Twelfth Man\" now.  At the Indy 500, drivers kiss the bricks. In Bonneville, Thompson fell to his knees and kissed the salt.", "Thompson gives thanks to the salt flats of Bonneville. Back at the pit, he proudly donned the black \"400\" cap and sat down to sign a few autographs.  He'd set things right for Mickey after all those years. His dad, he says, was probably talking in his ear the whole time he was flooring it, \"standing on the gas,\" as Mickey used to say. Thompson joked that he's sure he wasn't listening, just as he didn't listen as a kid. \"We got lucky,\" he said.  It's Danny Thompson's kind of luck -- the kind that saves you time and again. It might not bring riches. But it delivers just enough. A couple of years ago, when I first wrote about his quest, the headline raised this question: What drives Danny Thompson?  On August 14, 2016, national record in hand, he finally had the answer: \"What drives Danny Thompson? Insanity, I don't know,\" he said with a big laugh. \"It's just being passionate about finishing the job. What drives me is getting that record, bringing that record to the Thompson family, finishing a legacy for my dad, and a legacy for Danny Thompson.\"", "The end of a long journey -- and the beginning of another challenge. He'll be back at Bonneville, salt permitting, for next month's Cook's Shootout, where world records are set. He knows Challenger 2 has the potential to go even faster, maybe 450 or even 470 mph.  \"It will be a shootout between Speed Demon and us,\" he says. \"I can't quit. We call it salt fever. You just want to come back to Bonneville. You want to go faster.\" This time he'll be racing for his own legacy."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

The two narrative threads meet in Arizona, where both the Trumpier and establishmentier wings of the party are fielding very strong candidates in an upcoming Senate primary, with the winner set to face a strong Democratic challenger on whose shoulders the party\u2019s hopes for retaking the Senate largely rest. Here\u2019s what you need to know.  Trump scuttled a DACA deal After a televised meeting with members of Congress in which the president seemed confused on policy specifics but ready to agree to anything Congress agreed to regarding the fate of the DREAMers, a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement on a proposal, only to have the White House scuttle it based on the objections of Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR).", "President Trump presides over a meeting about immigration with Republican and Democrat members of Congress in the Cabinet Room of the White House on January 9.", "Why it matters: Without a deal, we may be looking at a government shutdown and are almost certainly looking at serious negative consequences for nearly 700,000 immigrants who\u2019ll lose their work permits and protection from deportation. What\u2019s going on? There\u2019s a strong contrast between what Trump keeps saying (that he sympathizes with the DREAMers\u2019 plight and wants to help them but also wants to do something on border security) and what he keeps doing (deferring to the most hardline anti-immigration members of his party, who insist on sweeping revisions to immigration policy). His stated position is very conducive to dealmaking, but his actions make a deal impossible. What\u2019s next? Nobody has officially broken off negotiations, so it\u2019s still possible in principle that a deal will be reached. Certainly it doesn\u2019t seem too hard to imagine a deal that could get 60 votes in the Senate. But if the White House doesn\u2019t want a deal \u2014 and it seems like that\u2019s the case \u2014 there won\u2019t be one. CHIP got cheaper but still didn\u2019t pass Congressional Republicans have been refusing to do a five-year extension of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program over demands that it, unlike the $1.5 trillion tax cut the GOP passed late last year, be paid for through offsetting spending cuts.

During the press conference, Democrats urged Republican members of Congress to \"drop their partisan CHIP reauthorization and adopt reasonable offsets to ensure 9 million children keep their health care.\"", "The CBO\u2019s new math: New estimates from the CBO say that a five-year extension would cost $800 million, and a 10-year extension would save $6 billion. Why it works: The core issue is that by repealing the individual mandate in last year\u2019s tax bill, Republicans pushed up premiums on Affordable Care Act marketplaces. But low-income families are still eligible for ACA subsidies \u2014 subsidies that rise in line with premiums \u2014 so under the new system, it will be cheaper to give kids CHIP insurance than to have them buy it on the marketplaces. There\u2019s still no deal: Since the argument was originally about how to offset the cost of extending CHIP funding but there now is no cost of extending CHIP funding, you\u2019d think that would get Congress to an easy agreement, but Republican leadership still has no plans to bring a CHIP bill to the floor. The program\u2019s funding expired more than 100 days ago, and kids are losing insurance. Trump said some things The Washington Post reported Thursday evening that during a meeting with lawmakers, President Trump questioned why people from \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa (plus Haiti) are allowed to come to the United States, while advocating that we find a way to bring in more immigrants from countries like Norway.", "Haiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse attends a ceremony in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on January 12.

(CNN) The problems bothering white Americans without a college degree have less to do with immediate economic insecurity or material hardship, although those are widespread, than with the collapse of a whole way of life.  Following World War II, production workers experienced three decades of unprecedented economic and social gains. But since the end of the 1970s, they have seen a nearly unremitting decline in their real wages, working conditions and social status, along with a loss of the interpersonal and work networks that were once the basis of their upward progress and their entire community's stability. I think it's fair to say that large segments of the white working-class are feeling shell-shocked. One pastor who has ministered to a congregation of whites in post-industrial central Philadelphia and to a rural congregation in Wisconsin said this of his parishioners: \"Every time something changed in their lives, it changed for the worse. And I mean just about every stinking time.\"  The rise and fall of stability in working-class life explains much that otherwise seems puzzling in the responses to this week's CNN-Kaiser Family Foundation poll. We've heard much about working-class anger. Yet the poll reveals a rather uncomplaining acceptance of what is, in many cases, a far from an easy life.  Read More Sixty-three percent of white working-class respondents say they are \"very\" or \"somewhat\" satisfied with their personal financial situation, even though in the past year 46% of them say they postponed medical or dental care and half took an extra job or added work hours to make ends meet. About 30% of those who are employed face the stress of work shifts that change every week. But 76% say they are optimistic about what's going on in their personal life, and 77% of those who are working believe their jobs are secure. However, this willingness to see the upside of difficult living conditions coexists with a deep pessimism about the future, and especially their children's future. Fully half of working-class whites expect their children's lives will be worse than their own. Fewer than one-quarter expect their children to do better. Working-class blacks and Hispanics are far more optimistic than their white counterparts, even though the unemployment rate of blacks without a college degree is twice as high as that of whites, as is the percentage of black workers who are working part time although they want full-time jobs.", "On average, blacks and Hispanics have lower incomes and are less likely to own their homes. They lost more ground than whites during the recession and have regained less ground since. Yet 36% of working-class blacks and 48% of working-class Hispanics believe their children will do better than they. Another striking difference is that only 45% of whites without a college education, compared to almost 75% of blacks and Hispanics, say their life would be better if they had a four-year college degree. Fifty-one percent of the whites think it would make no difference, and 3% feel it would have made things worse. These attitudes stem from the tremendous leap forward that white working-class Americans made in the 1950s and 1960s. People who study race relations in America often talk about white privilege, but this is a relative concept when it comes to the working class. For 200 years, elites had encouraged a sense of white superiority to defuse class resentments and head off interracial class alliances. But as in so many conflicts, the foot soldiers of white dominance seldom got a very large share of the spoils.  Low-income whites were given preference over minorities in hiring, wages, and promotions (except during strikes, when employers were quick to replace strikers with minorities whom they fired afterward, reinforcing hostility on both sides). Yet their relative advantages over workers of other races did not produce a life of privilege for white production workers, who earned low wages with few benefits, faced frequent layoffs and suffered high rates of on-the-job injuries.", "A coal miner's boot remains inside the St. Nicholas Coal Breaker in Manahoy City, Pennsylvania. Life got better In the decades after World War II, though, life got much better for white male workers and their families. The tremendous growth of unions, along with new government regulations, put a stop to some of the exploitative practices of employers. Meanwhile, from 1950 to 1979, government invested in infrastructure and new technologies at almost twice the rate since 1980, creating rapid blue-collar job growth.  For the first time, the American Dream came within reach for white blue-collar workers-- a dream not of immense wealth but of the ability to sustain a comfortable family life by working hard and well at your job. Between 1947 and 1973, the real wages of the average young male worker without a college education doubled as he moved from age 25 to 35. In 1959, the average 30-year-old man could pay the mortgage on a median-priced home using only 18% of his gross monthly pay. And his wages continued to rise through his working life as new seniority laws prevented aging workers from being displaced or demoted. A man passing from age 40 to 50 saw his earnings increase by another 30 percent.  Perhaps more important psychologically was that young people in that era could see that they were doing much better than their parents. In 1961, men aged 25 to 29 were, on average, earning four times more in real wages than their fathers at about the same age. A different kind of success The basis of success in working-class communities was very different from how success is gained by today's mobile professionals. Working-class neighborhoods clustered around sources of employment, within walking distance from the small businesses that depended on them for customers, and often within sight of the homes of the managers who supervised them.  There was suspicion of strangers, and racial segregation was the norm, but there was less separation by class and income than today. Their bosses often frequented the same churches. Educated professionals had enough close contact with workers to respect the skill and stamina involved in what economists now call \"routine\" or \"semi-skilled\" labor. At churches, work, and schools, people were enmeshed in stable personal networks that were far from egalitarian but were often the main way young men found a job and small businesses built their base. If you worked hard, respected your place in the social hierarchy, and conformed to community standards, you could expect to get a decent job, have the satisfaction of doing better than your own parents, and see your own kids do better than you.  Coming out of this tradition, it's no wonder that half of these individuals don't think having a four-year degree would have helped them. Their frame of reference is a world where you didn't need to go to college to do better than your father. It often made more sense to simply follow in his footsteps. The erosion of such communities and workplaces has been going on for almost 40 years. Many manufacturing jobs have been lost or outsourced. Most that are still around or have come back now pay lower wages and provide fewer benefits. Between 1947 and 1979, for example, real wages of meatpacking workers increased by an average of 80 percent (to just under $40,000 per year in constant dollars). But from 1979 to 2012, those wages declined by 30%, to about $27,000 a year.  The old social contract -- and the old social contacts -- have, for good and for ill, ceased to organize work and community life. For the past three decades, the average young man without a college degree has consistently done worse than his father. Between 1979 and 2007, young men with a high school degree suffered, on average, a 29% decline in real earnings.   Humans see things in relative terms. When we assess our present position and prospects, we do so in relation to our past experiences and expectations. Most white working-class Americans are still better off than most black and Hispanic non-college-educated workers, but they have been on a long, demoralizing downward slope. By contrast, although blacks and Hispanics started from a much lower base, they have seen remarkable progress since the early 1960s, despite suffering more than whites during recessions.  It is not surprising that so many white workers are pessimistic about their future. Even if their changes for the worse leave them better off than many of their black and Hispanic counterparts, people usually focus more on what they've lost rather than on the narrowing edge they may retain over others.  Why not go to college? But why, many ask, aren't lower-income white men flocking to college? It's more complicated than lack of initiative. Ironically, one thing that now holds white working-class men back is the residue of their traditional race and gender bonus: Men who drop out of college initially earn, on average, as much as men who have recently completed their degree.  The college advantage multiplies over time, but it's tempting -- although self-defeating in the long run -- to start earning as much as Joe the new college grad without foregoing earnings for several years or taking on debt. Furthermore, going to college can be risky for people whose parents can't offer substantial support. Older Americans who brag of working their way through college may not realize that between 1975 and 2015, tuition and fees grew by more than 200% at community colleges and at private, nonprofit, four-year colleges and universities -- after accounting for inflation. At public four-year colleges and universities, they grew by nearly 300%.  In 1979, the average student at a four-year university could pay for tuition by working just 182 hours per year. By 2013, the average student had to work 991 hours. And unlike the early 1970s, most available aid takes the form of loans rather than outright grants. A recent study of 3,000 young adults who entered public four-year institutions in Wisconsin found that even with the help of Pell grants, college was still unaffordable. Only half the students received any credential within six years, a long time to put earnings on hold. Almost 40% dropped out, many saddled with debt that put them further behind than when they started.  Even getting a degree does not guarantee getting a job that allows you to pay off debts. Since 2000, employment of college grads has grown more rapidly in low-earning than high-earning jobs. Many liberal politicians have failed to acknowledge those realities, and many conservatives have manipulated them to fan racial resentments. It's not just Trump who's been stirring the pot. Racial fears have been whipped up for years by the same politicians who now piously denounce them. Think Reagan's Welfare Queen, George H. Bush's Willie Horton, Jeb Bush's \"free stuff\" remarks, and the Clintons' \"Super-predators.\"  Racism is not the only reason for Trump's popularity. A significant number of Trump supporters say they voted for Obama in 2012, and so far Obama seems to have done better with white working-class voters in Florida, Ohio, and Iowa than Clinton is currently doing.  Blaming it on race But the legacy of racism runs deep, especially in the old Confederacy. And in the absence of a clear acknowledgement of how and why white working-class men and communities have suffered and without any firm commitment to turn that around, many whites have been persuaded to blame their declining fortunes on blacks and immigrants.  In the 1950s, race outweighed education in determining wage rates. On average, white men with only a high school degree out-earned blacks with a college degree. Today, education outweighs race. But many working-class whites don't yet realize that this is not a result of reversed racial preferences but of new market preferences:  Studies confirm that employers still favor white men over blacks in most labor markets where applicants have equal education. When nearly identical r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are sent out, for example, the candidate with a white-sounding name receives more callbacks than the applicant with a black-sounding name.  Some whites look at the gains of black professionals, formerly held back by legally enforced discrimination, and say that \"those people\" are taking a job that could be theirs. Yet if educated minorities weren't in the picture, it would be OTHER white people, from more privileged families, taking those jobs. And when liberals respond by framing equal rights as a matter of \"compassion\" or \"tolerance,\" without mentioning the growing class divide, it's not entirely surprising that sections of the white working class mishear calls for diversity as endorsement of their accelerating marginalization. As one young man complained while we were both waiting for relatives receiving treatment in a New Orleans hospital, \"everybody talks about the problems of the blacks, the illegals, the gays, the transgenders. But I see a lot more of them getting ahead than white guys like me.\" And an older woman told me \"I actually voted for hope and change, but we haven't gotten it down here, so when Clinton says, 'oh we already ARE great,' she loses me.

None of this excuses racist reactions. The tragedy is that in the \"good old days\" for white Americans without a college degree, their prosperity was less dependent on their unfair advantages over minorities than on a social consensus reaching across both parties that government could and should invest in infrastructure projects that create jobs for working people and enforce policies that protect workers' bargaining power. In the 1960s, when civil-rights activism extended those opportunities and protections to minorities as well as whites, this resulted in increased progress for workers in general and for racial equality. The political challenge today is how to acknowledge the legitimate sense of loss and exclusion experienced by white workers while persuading them that reestablishing racial and masculine privileges is a poor substitute for ensuring secure rights for all workers and getting rid of a political decision-making process that is rigged against them by business lobbyists and financial interest groups.  So far, most of Trump's establishment critics have failed to persuasively explain how they would create well-paying jobs and improve working people's bargaining power. So we see growing numbers of people who think that in a stacked deck, a \"wild card\" might not be such a bad thing. As a retired deputy sheriff from Montana put it, Trump is \"risky\" but at least he's looking at things \"through a different scope.\" Attacking Trump's unpredictability might even help his cause. The last 40 years have been depressingly predictable for working-class communities and small towns, and Trump's critics need to establish that they too can be \"change agents\" -- but in a much more substantive way."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

But even as President Trump has declared the opioid epidemic a national emergency, some agencies have failed to act as if it is one. Just last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama administration policy on marijuana, signaling that the Justice Department may prosecute people selling or using the drug. Regardless of your views on marijuana, deploying limited federal resources to prosecute pot cases amid a raging opioid epidemic is like telling firefighters to inspect smoke detector batteries in one home while the house next door is engulfed in flames. Meanwhile, the U.S. Postal Service could be doing more to intercept packages of illicit fentanyl coming from abroad. The Postal Service has moved at a lethargic pace to get much needed advance data from foreign countries that could cut exports of fentanyl, which is often mixed with or sold in place of heroin, to lethal effect.  For reasons that are unclear, the State Department, Justice Department and the president have had only limited success in getting China, the main source for fentanyl entering the United States, to assist in choking off the supply.  Sessions applauded the Chinese last week for restricting two chemical ingredients for fentanyl, an important move. But the Chinese government has failed to arrest two Chinese nationals, indicted by the U.S. last October as large distributors of fentanyl to Americans. Indictments aren\u2019t worth much if the criminals remain at large. Much of the fentanyl, which can be ordered on the Internet, comes into this country from China and Mexico often in small packages via private shippers and the U.S. mail. Customs and Border Protection officers, looking to intercept illegal shipments, now have to go through bags and bins of parcels manually, a daunting task.  The Postal Service could more easily spot fentanyl if it had some basic data \u2014 who and where the package is coming from and the recipient\u2019s name and address \u2014 in advance. That would \u201caid in targeting shipments,\u201d a top Customs official told a Senate hearing last May. Although a federal law has required private shippers to provide advance electronic data since 2002, the Postal Service\u2019s participation was left up to the postmaster general and leaders of another Cabinet department. More than 15 years later, the Postal Service still doesn\u2019t demand this advance data from all countries. Since 2016, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and a bipartisan coalition that has grown to 29 senators and 252 House members have pushed a commonsense measure to require that all countries provide this electronic data.  The president\u2019s commission on opioids supports it, too. The Postal Service's response? In testimony prepared for the Senate hearing, a top official said that it \u201cagrees with the goal\u201d of the measure, but that requiring all nations to provide this data immediately is \u201cimpractical\u201d and could cost as much as $4.8 billion over 10 years. Why not start with maximum tracking of mail from China and any other countries that appear to be significant sources of synthetic opioids? Nor has the U.S. given foreign countries a hard deadline to provide this potentially life-saving information. The best the Postal Service could offer was that it's \"seeing substantial data\" from China. It would not answer our questions about what percentage of Chinese mail comes with advance data. \u201cHow many more Americans have to die before our government gets its act together \u2026 to keep this poison out of our communities?\" Portman asked officials at the hearing. Good question. Deaths from drug overdoses have now far outstripped the toll from car crashes or guns, once the leading causes of accidental deaths. In fact, for two years in a row, skyrocketing deaths from drug overdoses have dragged down how long Americans are expected to live. According to several national polls over the past two years, 49% of Americans, an astounding number, said they know someone who has been addicted to prescription painkillers. Yet according to the same polls, more than half said it is a major problem but not an emergency. Perhaps that\u2019s because the deaths don\u2019t occur as mass tragedies but in an unending stream of individual casualties in cities, towns and rural communities across the country. Galvanizing the public would be helpful. More important is galvanizing the federal government into emergency mode to deal with an elusive mass killer, fentanyl, that is claiming the lives of more than two people every hour.

The firmly tongue-in-cheek study is published in the mostly humorous end-of-year holiday issue of the British Medical Journal.   \u201cOutstanding questions on this topic remain; first and foremost perhaps is why a delicacy such as asparagus results in such a strong odor?\u201d Mucci\u2019s team asked in their report.   \u201cAnd, will scientists take the results of our study and apply gene editing techniques to convert smellers to non-smellers?\u201d   The team used two big studies of 6,900 men and women to find out why some people can smell the asparagus effect and others cannot.   \u201cFindings show that 40 percent of participants agreed that they could smell a distinct odor in their urine after eating asparagus, and 60 percent said they could not and were labeled as 'asparagus anosmic.'\u201d   They're pretty sure it's not a case of some people having the smell or not -- people who can't smell the asparagus effect in their own urine can't smell it in the urine of people who are known to produce the smell.   They looked through 9 million different genes to see why, and found 871 mutations in the majority of people who cannot smell the effects of eating asparagus in their own urine. \u201cAll were located on chromosome 1, containing multiple members of the olfactory receptor 2 gene family,\u201d they wrote.   Asparagus is good for you, they noted, so it may be important to help people cope with their ability or inability to smell it.   \u201cAsparagus is rich in iron, fiber, zinc, folate and vitamins A, E and C. Consumption of asparagus, as part of a diet high in vegetables, has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of cancer, cognitive impairment and cardiovascular related diseases,\u201d they wrote.   \u201cFurthermore, literature from the 15th century touts its aphrodisiac qualities.\u201d   It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s better to smell the asparagus or not to smell it.   \"Future replication studies are necessary before considering targeted therapies to help anosmic people discover what they are missing,\u201d the team concluded."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

His Emirati hosts couldn't have been happier. \"We could have given that exact same speech,\" Emirati Ambassador to the U.S. Yousef al-Otaiba said. Gulf Arab nations, which view Iran as a regional menace and opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, have welcomed the hard line adopted by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. But there are differences lingering beneath the smiles and handshakes, including over Washington's alliance with Qatar, which is being boycotted by the UAE and three other Arab nations. Ryan said the nuclear deal should remain in place, but that more economic sanctions should be imposed to counter the \"Iranian threat.\" He pointed to Iran's ballistic missiles and its \"land bridge\" to Syria, where it has provided crucial military and economic support to President Bashar Assad. \"This is an existential threat to you, it is an existential threat to Saudi Arabia,\" the Wisconsin Republican told an audience at the Emirates Diplomatic Academy in Abu Dhabi, the day after his delegation visited Saudi Arabia and met with its king. \"I want you to know that we see this issue the same way that you do,\" he said. \"Let me be clear: Congress will not repeat the mistakes of the past. And we will not remain silent about the plight of the Iranian people who have faced brutal repression at the hands of the regime in Tehran.\" Al-Otaiba, a well-known figure in Washington, also said Iran must be confronted. \"If you live in the UAE, the biggest problem is Iranian support for terrorist proxies, its missile program, its funding and subversion of friendly countries in this part of the world,\" he said. \"I couldn't be happier to hear a speech like this from the Speaker of the House.\" The UAE is a major U.S. ally that hosts some 5,000 American troops and the U.S. Navy's busiest foreign port of call. The UAE also has purchased billions in American armaments, including the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD. The UAE is also a key member of the Saudi-led coalition at war with Yemen's Houthi rebels. The U.S., which is providing some support to the coalition, and its Arab allies accuse Iran of providing increasingly sophisticated weapons to the Shiite rebels, including a ballistic missile fired at the Saudi capital on Nov. 4. Iran denies arming the Houthis. The war has been locked in a stalemate for most of the last three years, with more than 10,000 civilians killed, many in Saudi-led airstrikes using American armaments. Ryan did not mention the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which the U.N. has described as the worst in the world. The U.S. is still waging a longstanding campaign of drone strikes targeting suspected members of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. A January 2017 raid ordered by Trump killed a U.S. Navy SEAL and 30 other people, including women, children and an estimated 14 militants. \"You fight this battle every single day against al-Qaida in Yemen,\" Ryan said. \"You understand firsthand why we must take these threats very seriously.\" No one mentioned Qatar at Thursday's event. The U.S. ally has faced a boycott since last June by the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia over allegations it supports extremists and maintains too-close ties to Iran. Qatar, which has supported Islamists who the UAE views a threat to its system of hereditary rule, denies backing extremists. It also shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Iran and has increasingly relied on Iranian airspace for flights of its state carrier Qatar Airways. Qatar hosts some 10,000 American soldiers at the al-Udeid Air Base, which hosts the forward operating base of the U.S. military's Central Command. Al-Otaiba, who had his personal emails hacked and released publicly during the Qatar crisis, has been a vocal critic of Doha. He's also suggested U.S. forces relocate from al-Udeid to somewhere else, perhaps the UAE, but did not offer that suggestion publicly Thursday. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

One is to deport people who come to the United States illegally and commit serious crimes. Another is to target people who come on temporary visas, fail to leave when the visas expired, and melt into the population \u2014 a group that makes up more than 40% of the undocumented immigrants.  But smart changes do not begin with forcing out immigrants, such as nearly 200,000 Salvadorans who\u2019ve been welcomed in the country for 17 years and who are primarily productive, tax-paying residents. Or, for that matter, the 800,000 young immigrants, known as \u201cdreamers,\u201d who were brought here as infants or children with no idea that their parents were doing anything wrong. With so many people's futures at stake, there are obvious deals to be made from which all sides \u2014 Republicans, Democrats and immigrants alike \u2014 could gain. But just when such an agreement seemed to be within reach, President Trump\u2019s vulgar slur against some immigrants at a White House meeting Thursday blew up negotiations and, not surprisingly, spurred global condemnation. As the world now knows, during a discussion about the future of immigration from Haiti, El Salvador and some African countries, Trump questioned why the U.S. was letting in people from \u201cshithole countries\u201d rather than nations such as Norway, according to Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who attended the Oval Office meeting.  Racist language of any sort does not belong in the White House and demeans this country\u2019s history as a beacon of hope and a haven for even the most downtrodden. That welcoming culture has made America a diverse, economically strong and powerful nation. Consider, for example, these facts about the 195,000 Salvadorans and 50,000 Haitians who\u2019ve been welcomed under \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d here for many years but would be sent home by 2019 under Trump\u2019s plan: Nearly 90% of Salvadorans and 81% of Haitians hold jobs and pay taxes. A third of the Salvadorans hold mortgages, and nearly half speak English well or very well. Together, both groups have nearly 220,000 U.S.-born children who are citizens. All of those with protected status from 10 countries have been vetted repeatedly, including providing fingerprints about every 18 months. They are just the kind of productive, law-abiding immigrants on which this nation counts. Trump tweeted Sunday that an immigration deal is \"probably dead,\" but if a compromise is still possible \u2014 and it should be \u2014 it could combine changes sought by each side. For Republicans, the deal could include more money to strengthen southern border security, including electronic surveillance, drones and physical barriers where needed; a gradual move away from immigration based on family relationships toward immigrants selected for skills the U.S. needs; and a better system to spot and remove those elusive foreigners who overstay visas. Democrats would get full-scale protection and an eventual path to legality for the 800,000 dreamers, along with a permanent reprieve for Salvadorans, Haitians and others who were given \u201ctemporary\u201d protection from natural or man-made disasters in their home countries \u2014 protection that was extended by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama for as long as 15 years. At some point, the meaning of temporary gets overridden by the reality of extensions, which these people relied on as they put down roots. Should they be punished for relying on the government's actions? Should the Salvadorans be forced to return to a place where, the State Department warned last week, \u201cviolent crime \u2026 is common\u201d and \u201cgang activity \u2026 is widespread.\u201d Future immigration policy needs a good dose of honesty to replace fiction, which hurts immigrants and erodes Americans\u2019 belief in the rule of law. It is not honest for Congress to make it illegal to cross the border, then allow businesses to hire undocumented immigrants for years with no penalty. Nor is it honest to claim that a program is \u201ctemporary\u201d and then extend it for two decades. The contours of a bipartisan compromise on immigration are clear \u2014 but that won't happen if the president, elected in part because of his supposed deal-making prowess, continues to roil the waters with racist rants.

It cannot be considered fully complete because records of some player arrests might not have been found for various reasons, including lack of media coverage or accessible public records. Many resolutions to these cases also are pending or could not be immediately found.

Beyond, that is, the tribulations of the Trump administration, the controversies of the Democrats, and the always critical question that vexes \u201cThis Town\u201d: what\u2019s the hottest restaurant? As The Washington Post asked last month, is it possible to get a decent dinner for two in DC for less than $100? Okay, so here\u2019s another item that\u2019s punched through inside the Beltway: A new article on climate change\u2014a cover story, in fact\u2014in New York magazine is getting lots of attention. The headline was indeed a grabber: \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth: Famine, economic collapse, a sun that cooks us: What climate change could wreak\u2014sooner than you think.\u201d The piece, by one David Wallace-Wells, has been touted in Politico\u2019s July 10 edition of \u201cPlaybook\u201d as a key \u201cAfternoon Read.\u201d And then the equally Beltway-buzzy Mike Allen\u2014himself formerly of Politico and \u201cPlaybook\u201d\u2014touted it even harder in his Axios AM report that blared, \u201cIf you read only 1 thing: \u2018Doomsday.\u2019\u201d Admittedly, such hyping doesn\u2019t guarantee that the article will play in Peoria, but it\u2019s a safe bet that many leading Democrats, and their Green allies, will be devouring \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth.\u201d Indeed, lest anyone think that some headline-writer oversold the story, here are the actual first words: It is, I promise, worse than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible. The author understands that his core readership is likely to have kept up with the daily\u2014or is it hourly?\u2014updates from The New York Times on the presumed horrors of climate change.  Still, he continues, there\u2019s more to fearful of: \u201cNo matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough.\u201d To further pound the point home, the article is festooned with imaginative graphics of future human \u201cfossils,\u201d all meant to illustrate the deadly end that CO2 supposedly foretells for us as a species. Some have accused Wallace-Wells of overwriting his piece, and in fact, there\u2019s been plenty of pushback, including from \u201cPlaybook,\u201d which fair-and-balanced-ly cited a Green critic of the article. Indeed, some more moderate Greens have taken issue with the lurid tone of the piece\u2014although, of course, such controversy might only increase its notoriety. As they say, Just spell the name right. In fact, there\u2019s already a thriving market for climate-change doom-and-gloom. Indeed, there\u2019s a rapidly expanding genre known as \u201cclimate fiction,\u201d or \u201ccli-fi,\u201d which includes such books as Year of the Flood, The Drowned Cities, and The Water Knife; there\u2019s even a book on how to write your own book: Saving the World One Word at a Time: Writing Cli-Fi. And of course, there are plenty of movies with cli-fi plots or themes, including The Day After Tomorrow, Interstellar, and Snowpiercer. And coming soon: Gerard Butler in Geostorm. It might well be the case, of course, that there\u2019s more eagerness, in Manhattan and Hollywood, to supply these works than there is eagerness among ordinary audiences to consume them. Yet still, the cumulative weight of all this Green-themed content is having some impact\u2014as the polls suggest. Yet even if cli-fi can be dismissed as a case of the elite attempting to force-feed its worldview onto the non-elite, we still might be curious to ask: Where did this high-end end-is-nigh impulse come from in the first place? Why are so many in the upper crust so eager to embrace such pessimism? One answer, of course, is that the idea of eschaton\u2014the consideration of the world\u2019s end\u2014has always been with us; it is simply always finding new fans and taking on new forms. Wikipedia provides a handy, if hardly complete, list of doomsday prophecies from the past, as well as plenty more about the near future. Moreover, in 2011, The New Scientist magazine looked at the question of \u201cWhy do we like reading about our own destruction?\u201d It quoted Lorenzo DiTommaso, a professor of religion at Concordia University in Montreal, describing doomsayers across history: \u201cThey tend to be quite intelligent compared with the general population but they are looking for answers for how life is the way it is.\u201d Of course, some might dispute that these apocalypse-now-ers are, in fact, \u201cquite intelligent,\u201d but it\u2019s impossible to deny that today at least, they tend to be well-educated and well-off. We can further observe that for the elites, special knowledge of a certain type is a kind of status symbol. That is, it\u2019s empowering to think that one knows things, and sees things, that mere proles and other lesser mortals aren\u2019t smart enough to know and see. So if the elites are as anointed as they think they are, then of course they have a vision that gazes farther into the future than everyone else. By this reckoning, a serious concern about climate change is what sociologists call a \u201csignifier\u201d\u2014that is, an indicator of exalted status. Adding that doomsayers have a distinct and articulated worldview, DiTommaso continued:  Within its limitations, apocalypticism is very rational. It\u2019s a worldview that explains time, space, and human existence. It\u2019s not science\u2014it\u2019s not universal or repeatable\u2014but it does explain things. The professor also said that for the world-enders, a vision of doom \u201cprovides a very powerful way of understanding the world and all its problems.\u201d We might linger over those words, \u201ca very powerful way of understanding the world.\u201d  We can further observe, in the hands of the motivated, that an argument doesn\u2019t have to be true; it merely has to be useful. Moreover, we can see that such mind-tools suggest that doomsayers will find comfort in political activism, as well as religious belief\u2014especially an active belief in Green religion. And since we\u2019re speaking of professors and their new forms of faith, we might recall the famous case of Stanford University\u2019s Paul Ehrlich. Back in 1968, Ehrlich published The Population Bomb, declaring, \u201cThe battle to feed all of humanity is over\u201d\u2014as in, humanity has lost. Indeed, he predicted that \u201chundreds of millions\u201d would starve to death in the 1970s, including 65 million Americans. Finally, he concluded, \u201cSometime in the next 15 years, the end will come\u201d\u2014that is, \u201can utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.\u201d By now, the chronologically inclined reader will have calculated that Ehrlich\u2019s prediction of global degringolade was set to occur in 1983. (In that year\u2019s World Series, the Orioles beat the Phillies in five; in other words, despite Ehrlich\u2019s prophecy, human affairs carried on.) Yet revealingly, even though The Population Bomb was a bomb in terms of accuracy, it remained in print for decades; we can only conclude that for some, the veracity of a prediction is less important than its utility. That is, some people actively want to believe the worst, truth be damned. And of course, an active belief in anything is the seedbed of political activity. And the Greens have certainly been active. As this author has noted in the past, the 2016 Democratic Party platform proved to be far more attentive to the issue of climate change than to the well-being of middle-income workers. (That might help explain why Hillary Clinton did so poorly among those folks last year.) Of course, since then, the Greens haven\u2019t gotten any weaker; if anything, they are stronger inside the Democratic Party. And thus we come back to Wallace-Wells\u2019 piece, the one that seems to tell us that we\u2019re all doomed\u2014the sad scenario that brings smiles to the faces of so many Greens. Yet interestingly, foreordained doom isn\u2019t quite what the author foresees. Indeed, despite the despairing tone of the piece, at the end, after 7,000 dire words, the piece\u2019s conclusion is rather hopeful; the author volunteers that despite all the climate-darkness, there\u2019s a ray of hope. Happily, that ray of hope isn\u2019t just some figment of imagination, but rather, a solid beacon of historical precedent\u2014the knowledge that in the past, technological progress has saved us, and it can do so again. As the author puts it, to reach the carbon dioxide goals set by the Greens will take some doing, but we can do it: By 2050, carbon emissions from energy and industry . . . will have to fall by half each decade; emissions from land use (deforestation, cow farts, etc.) will have to zero out; and we will need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet\u2019s plants now do. Nevertheless, by and large, the scientists have an enormous confidence in the ingenuity of humans\u2014a confidence perhaps bolstered by their appreciation for climate change, which is, after all, a human invention, too. In other words, if we have invented our way into a problem, we can invent ourselves out of it. Ah yes, human inventiveness: It\u2019s been changing our world since cave-men stumbled into the sparking of that first fire. And more recently, since the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions of the 17th and 18th century, inventiveness has changed our world a thousand times more. And so, Wallace-Wells asks, why shouldn\u2019t human invention continue into the future? As he himself writes, if we can put a man on the moon, we can de-carbonize the atmosphere. To be sure, some on the right will argue that we shouldn\u2019t bother worrying about CO2, because climate change is a mirage, or even a hoax. And that might be the case\u2014or it might not. Yet either way, being mindful of global political realities, it can\u2019t hurt for all of us to prudently explore ways of improving our scientific understanding of carbon capture. The upside of such an understanding is the greater likelihood that we will be able to continue burning the hundreds of trillions of dollars of fossil fuels\u2014oil, gas, and coal\u2014that is yet to be found in the US, as well as saving the tens of millions of well-paying American jobs in the fossil-fuel industry. With the economic well-being of red-state America\u2014and of all America\u2014in mind, this author has argued for such a carbon-capture strategy in the past, including here, here, and here. Okay, leaving aside eschaton, ideology, and technology, what about the raw politics of the carbon-capture issue? What do the two parties think of it? Right now, carbon-capture has little salience, even if it is a multi-billion dollar effort. Yet looking ahead, we can assume that Republicans, who mostly represent the fossil fuel states, from Texas to Kentucky to North Dakota to Alaska, will be on board with anything that lets them and their voters continue to drill, baby, drill. Alright, so now what of the Democrats? Although once the \u201coil patch\u201d was solidly Democratic, these days, newer Democrats have been hostile to the extractive industries; they are now the party of high-tech \u201cpost-industrial\u201d classes, as well as public-sector dependents\u2014and neither are much interested in old-line energy jobs. Yet still, as the reality that they lost the 2016 election\u2014as well as the four contested special elections in 2017\u2014sinks in to the Democrats, they might find that they, too, will be well-served by a non-greenhouse gas-producing energy solution. After all, they have to do something to get back the votes of working-class whites\u2014and they know it. So there\u2019s at least the chance of a meeting of the two parties\u2019 minds, based on that classic American goal: More. To be sure, we shouldn\u2019t minimize the challenges ahead for a carbon-capture strategy, but the upside, in terms of economic gains and political cooperation, makes it a worthy undertaking. Yes, it\u2019s a bit ironic: That ultra-gloomy New York magazine article ultimately comes down on the side of hope, including hope for folks in the Heartland, whose livelihoods and futures depend on robust energy production. Indeed, one can even look at the piece and see within it the prospects of a blue-state/red-state reconciliation, of the kind that our polarized and divided nation sorely needs. So who knows: Maybe one day it will be said that the challenge of climate change, when twinned with the imperative of economic growth, served to actually bring Americans together, joined in a new era of prosperity."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Whether the Rams are in a good situation, however, is up for debate. It\u2019s never a good thing to have six starters set to watch their contracts expire, even if it is a testament to how well they played the previous year. There\u2019s no doubt the Rams will work extremely hard to retain all six players, but they also have to deal with the fact that Mark Barron and Robert Quinn could both be cut, and Aaron Donald needs a contract extension.

The inspector general\u2019s move comes in response to a request from Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) for an investigation into whether the EPA staffer colluded with the agricultural giant to bias research on glyphosate, a key component of the product Roundup. His request was based on media reports of documents released in the course of a lawsuit against Monsanto alleging glyphosate causes cancer, and that the company may have spun research and hired scientists to cover this up. \u201cAs you are aware, there is considerable public interest regarding allegations of such collusion,\u201d wrote Inspector General Arthur A. Elkins Jr. in his response to Lieu, dated May 31. \u201cAs a result, I have asked the EPA OIG Office of Investigations to conduct an inquiry into several agency review-related matters.\u201d The EPA and Lieu did not immediately return requests for comment for this story. Documents released in the lawsuit reference internal Monsanto emails mentioning Jess Rowland, who was previously a manager in the EPA\u2019s pesticide division, allegedly bragging to company officials in April 2015 that he could \u201ckill\u201d investigations into glyphosate. A Monsanto regulatory affairs manager sent an email to colleagues that said Rowland had told him, \u201cIf I can kill this I should get a medal.\u201d At the time of the email, Monsanto was apparently seeking Rowland\u2019s help to shut down a review of glyphosate within the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Rowland retired from the EPA last year, and plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have been deposing him about allegations that Monsanto may have funneled money to him through third parties. Rowland\u2019s lawyer, William E. Lawler III, downplayed the IG\u2019s letter in an email to HuffPost. \u201cJess Rowland is a well-respected former public servant who honorably served the EPA for 26 years and received commendations from the agency both during his service and on his retirement,\u201d wrote Lawler. \u201cHe is a man of the highest integrity and ethics and he has done nothing wrong.\u201d Monsanto did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Inspectors general have wide-ranging authority to investigate matters of corruption at federal agencies, explains Michael Hubbard, a retired Special Agent in Charge for the EPA\u2019s criminal investigations division.  With confirmation that the IG\u2019s office is taking up a probe, it\u2019s likely that IG investigators will begin interviewing Rowland\u2019s former colleagues and bosses, pulling records and looking through his emails, Hubbard said. Another step could involve looping in investigators at the Department of Justice\u2019s Public Integrity Section, or obtaining subpoenas that would grant access to Rowland\u2019s bank records. \u201cYou want to start looking at money trails,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cHas he benefited from Monsanto? Was the money changing hands with him or his significant other?\u201d The court cases against Monsanto have rippled across the Atlantic, sparking debate in Europe, where governments are considering whether to renew an application allowing glyphosate to stay on the market in the European Union, said Bart Staes, a Belgian member of parliament representing the Green Party. \u201cThere has been a political and scientific debate for the last two years because the authorization to bring glyphosate to the market has expired and we need to make a decision by the end of the year,\u201d said Staes. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, the World Health Organization division focused on cancer, issued a conclusion in March 2015 that glyphosate is carcinogenic. But the European Food Safety Authority, an EU scientific body evaluating food-related concerns, issued its own finding in October 2015 that it was not. The two rely on different criteria to come to their decision, Staes said: While IARC relies on published studies, EFSA is also able to assess data that is proprietary to companies. Last week, Christopher Portier, the former associate director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, sent a letter to the president of the European Commission stating that he had re-examined some raw data of animal studies EFSA used to conclude that glyphosate did not cause cancer, and found eight instances of tumors that EFSA had not included in its assessment. Portier recently retired after 40 years of employment in the United States government and is now a part-time adviser to the Environmental Defense Fund and a consultant to a law firm involved in glyphosate litigation. Members of the EU Parliament had asked him to review a portion of the proprietary data EFSA released to them, though he is not allowed to make that data more widely available, he said. \u201cThe lawyers back in the States haven\u2019t seen this,\u201d Portier told HuffPost. Portier, who added that he wasn\u2019t compensated for this work, said he is going to write to the EPA administrator himself because \u201cthey also missed all the tumors.\u201d  \u201cThey have had this information in their files for decades, but they never analyzed the data,\u201d he told HuffPost. The head of IARC recently told Politico that his organization has faced an onslaught of criticism regarding its conclusions on glyphosate similar to backlash IARC faced from tobacco companies in the early 2000s when it concluded that secondhand smoke causes cancer.  Staes said the glyphosate lawsuit in the U.S. has spurred further concern that Monsanto has colluded with purportedly independent scientists: \u201cWe are now getting some written proof of collusion between scientists and Monsanto, which has these scientists like puppets on a string.\u201d Following Portier\u2019s letter, Staes and three other members of parliament filed a lawsuit demanding that EFSA make all the data on glyphosate public.  \u201cMore and more, the debate is about corporations controlling the science, and then this science is used by the regulators,\u201d said Staes. \u201cThis really goes beyond glyphosate.\u201d"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@FantasticMrNate) reports. Buzz60", "The Securities and Exchange Commission was in the hot seat after it admitted hackers made their way into its EDGAR electronic filing system last year and made off with information it believes might have been used to make money illegally in the stock market. U.S. lawmakers were stung by the news, late Wednesday, of the breach of the SEC's sensitive corporate data -- a disclosure that comes just two weeks after Equifax, one of the nation's three largest credit bureaus, revealed that hackers were able to access the private financial data of 143 million people. A Senate banking committee will seek answers Tuesday in Washington, when members, at a previously scheduled hearing, will likely grill SEC chairman Jay Clayton -- who took over the SEC's top post in May -- on the timeline and details of the data breach. The breach involving Wall Street's top cop may be unsettling \"burglary\" of market-moving data, but it's no Equifax in terms of consumer exposure. However, the hack that allowed cyber thieves to burrow into a government regulator's database filled with millions of corporate filings about earnings, mergers and digital trading footprints does little to instill confidence in the integrity of the market that millions of Americans depend on to fuel their 401(k) and pension investments.  \"It won't make mom-and-pop investors feel comforted to know that the regulator keeping their investments safe got hacked,\" says Joe Saluzzi, co-founder of Themis Trading and co-author Broken Markets. Members of the House of Representatives also say they are in fact-finding mode. In an interview with USA TODAY, Congressman Bill Huizenga of Michigan, chair of the House subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment, said: \"We all need to dive in more deeply as to what happened here.\" What troubles Huizenga is the fact that everyone knows the SEC is a prime target of hackers, \"and clearly not enough attention was paid to securing\" the corporate data in its filing system. \"We can't view this as a victimless crime. It was a burglary. Market-moving information like that has got to be protected,\" said Huizenga. \"Regulators have to be held to the same standard as the companies and (market players) they are regulating.\" But security experts say the financial fallout for everyday Americans might not be as bad as feared. \"This hack is different than the Equifax or Target hacks,\" says Lev Lesohkin, executive vice president of New York-based CAST, a software intelligence company. \"The hackers (in the SEC data theft) are not going after consumer data\" that could be used to steal a person's identity. It was only in August that the SEC learned that hackers may have been able to use their illegal activities to make ill-gotten gains through market trading, said SEC's Clayton in astatement posted on the SEC's website late Wednesday. EDGAR, which stands for Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval, is considered critical to the SEC's operation and the ability of investors to see the electronic filings of companies, brokerage firms and mutual funds. The SEC says about 50 million documents are viewed through EDGAR on a typical day. It receives about 1.7 million filings a year. While most filings are made public immediately, ones that require SEC feedback at times, such as quarterly and annual reports or documents related to companies about to sell stock to the public for the first time, are not. It is these types of non-public data that can be stolen and traded upon illegally by hackers, analysts say. Lesohkin's theory is the SEC attack was executed by sophisticated hackers that understood how they could profit by extracting market-moving data from the EDGAR system. For example, hackers might have targeted what the SEC calls its Consolidated Audit Trail, or CAT.  CAT provides what amounts to a digital trading footprint, that facilitates \"the efficient tracking of trading activity\" in the stock market, the SEC's Clayton noted in his statement. For example, if a hacker found out in a filing that, say, Warren Buffett was building a huge stake in a stock unbeknownst to the marketplace, a hacker could profit on that information by buying the stock before the rest of the market found out and it rose in price, says Saluzzi. This is not the first time the SEC's EDGAR system has been infiltrated by cyber thieves. In May, the SEC filed fraud charges against a man that schemed to manipulate the price of Fitbit stock by \"making a phony regulatory filing.\" Similarly, on May 15, 2015, a fake financial firm put in a fake filing with the SEC claiming it was buying cosmetics company Avon for $18.75 a share, at the time the stock was trading at $6. Avon shares shot up, and trading in the stock was halted three times that day before the fraud was determined.

For others, it's a decision reached later in life, either after a defining moment that snaps everything into focus or after carefully deliberating for years. And then there are those who wait for a clear answer that never comes. We asked HuffPost Women's Facebook community about what it's really like to make the decision to be childfree. Here are 11 of their stories: Getting pregnant made everything clear. When I was 27, I got pregnant with a guy I was dating. I wasn't far along, but I could already feel my body changing. My gums were swollen and bled. My breasts were tender. The guy I was seeing said he would support whatever decision I made, and my mother and sister were just as supportive. It was entirely my decision. On the third day after taking the test, as I woke up to grab my Gatorade (which was the only thing I could stomach) it hit me: I don't want a child. I don't want the pregnancy experience. I don't even like to hold babies, much less give birth to one. Before I got pregnant, I would say I was 98 percent sure I didn't want kids. When people would ask me, I'd say no -- but always follow that up with \"you never know, maybe one day.\" In that moment, however, it was like, no. Just, no. -- Callie, 33, South Carolina   I've just always known. I've never wanted children, for as long as I can remember. If I played house with other kids, I was never the mom. I went to a very small Catholic grade school and I vividly remember an assignment for our confirmation classes that asked us where we saw ourselves in five to 10 years. Every girl in my class talked about how they wanted to be married with children, a white picket fence... the whole package. I was literally the only person that said I wanted to live in an apartment in Chicago with a dog. -- Katie, 28, Illinois   I realized I don't want to bring kids into a world like this.  I was always on the fence about having children, but then I started to volunteer as a sexual assault crisis counsellor in my mid-20s and that pretty much got rid of my ambivalence. As I worked with more and more women who were survivors of childhood sexual trauma, it became obvious to me that our justice system is not in their favor. They were courageous survivors, but most of them never saw justice as children and battled lives full of PTSD, fear, depression, addiction and anxiety. I quickly realized this is not the type of world I wanted to bring a child into -- it simply was not right for me. I believe I would have come to the same decision if I hadn't had that experience; however, not as decisively as I did. What I witnessed as a sexual assault crisis counsellor was not something I could shake -- especially when I thought about bringing my own child into this world. Until we care more about the well being of our children in general, I won't be in a hurry to have any myself. -- Sara, 28, Canada   For no particular reason, I suddenly had my answer. I've known for as long as I can remember that I never wanted kids and I never even thought twice about it until my late 20s. At that point, I went through some real angst over it, wondering how I could look at a baby and feel nothing inside, and trying to talk myself into having a kid or two. A lot of my friends were having kids, and my mom was asking about it. It was almost a daily thing -- I'd just be spinning the wheels in my head. One day something inside of me snapped and I told myself that I was making the decision then and there. I said, there are no new facts to consider. You're not suddenly going to get some new information that makes this easier, so just go with your gut. In that moment, I knew the answer was I didn't want kid -- and then I instantly felt so relieved. I haven't looked back since. (I have a lot of weird epiphanies, like, I can tell you the exact moment I began liking bell peppers.) I don't know what it was about that particular moment; it was just... time. It's like being at a restaurant and not being able to chose between a salad and a burger. At some point when the waitress comes, you just have to order. -- A, 33, Texas (for privacy reasons, only first initial has been used)   I finally saw a model for what a childfree life looks like. I've never had an interest in children, but it was in college that I decided that I would be childfree. I had a few female professors who did not have kids and who led perfectly fulfilling lives, with books and pets. I spoke to one of my professors about it, and I follow her on Facebook, so I get a lot of updates about her life. I never had a model for it before then, as my entire family is \"traditional\" -- you get married, have kids, that kind of thing. I had never considered the childfree life a \"complete\" life, having grown up with that, but I knew it was the life I wanted to have. It's taken a lot of work to accept that it's not selfish to want what I want. -- Jessica, 25, South Carolina   I still have some fears (and that's natural) I've never wanted kids, I just feel like I don't have the \"mother gene.\" The only real regret I have is that I know how badly my own mother wanted grandchildren, and that I never gave her any -- she has stage IV colon cancer, so that definitely makes the regret run a little deeper.  But I don't think these fears or regrets need to be eased, and they don't run my life. They are more fleeting thoughts, which I believe are normal -- natural. There was no defining moment for me, no a-ha. To this day, kids and babies just make me very uncomfortable. I don't relate to them. -- Niki, 38, Chicago   I'm 39 and still unsure. I'm 39 and always thought in the back of my mind I might have kids someday, but now I'm ambivalent about it. I have a good job, a house, I travel several times a year and have a lot of freedom. So if kids were to happen now, fine. If not, that'd be fine, too.   I'm surprised by my ambivalence. I always said 35 was my cutoff to have a baby... and then 35 came and went. I was briefly married in my early 20s and figured it would just happen eventually, but then the marriage ended before it even became a topic of conversation. If I met a man I felt would truly make a good father and life partner, I would consider it, though at 39, I am not sure it's even a reasonable expectation that it would occur naturally. It's also definitely not a priority in my life. -- Kristen, 39, Florida   Spending a lot of time around kids gave me my answer. When I was a child, I thought I would get married and have four kids. Then I became a teacher and realized that I really like children, but I don't really like them after 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. It was a sudden realization. I would think to myself, \"How could I go home and deal with more kids, even if they were my own?\"    I have a niece and a nephew who I helped take care of when they were babies, which was a pleasure, but when their mother or father came to get them, I was elated. I realized that I just don't have that thing, that factor, to be the type of mother I'd want to be -- the kind that gets on the ground and plays, is patient when they're moody. I just... don't. I hear all the time, \"You're so good with kids!\" People just assume that if you're a nurturing person, you should automatically have children, but I don't have that desire. -- Andi, 33, Texas   I don't want to go off my medication. I have always loved children -- I love being around them, listening to the things they have to say. How they perceive the world is magical to me. When I was younger, I thought that I would have lots of babies, but now at 25 I have a feeling in my very core that I'm not meant to. I have been taking Paxil, the anti-anxiety medication, since I was 12, and it has been linked to birth defects. I've tried to get off the medication, but every withdrawal has been filled with cold sweats, vomiting, dizziness, chronic fatigue and weight loss. The thought of going through nine months of withdrawal while pregnant is something that terrifies me. The stress it would put on the baby and myself wouldn't make for a healthy pregnancy. I know that I will probably never be able to carry a child. Call it instinct. -- Samantha, 25, Florida   I feel ill just thinking about pregnancy, but I worry about regret. I'd always planned that I'd get married and then have kids by the time I was 30. I was engaged at 21, but realized I didn't want to spend the rest of my life with my husband. Then I was in a relationship with a guy for seven years who was a terrible father to his kids already, and I left him. Since then, I've traveled. I volunteered in Africa for two years. I'm 36 and I really don't know if I want kids or not -- I've cried over the fact that I may well now be too late (I'm not sure I have enough time to find someone and bring kids into the world with him) and at the same time, I'm not sure that I actually want to go through pregnancy at all. I love the freedom I have, and the fact I have a well-paid job with plenty of time to travel; however, I'm scared from everybody's hype that one day I'll wake up and regret not having kids. To be really certain that I want to have kids, I'd have to meet the right guy, and know that he wants to have kids also and that we'd continue adventuring together. But then I read an article about pregnancy and childbirth and I think no again... I feel nauseous just thinking about pregnancy and childbirth. -- Kayley, 36, UK   When I got my tubes tied, I finally felt '\"childfree.\" I remember telling my mother when I was about 5 years old that I never intended to have children. Of course, she brushed me off and gave me the usual, \"Oh, you're young. You will change your mind.\" As I grew older I wavered -- not because I was unsure, but because of the pressures of society. But when I was 25, I decided to be loud and proud about my childfree status -- that was the year that I became pregnant while on birth control. My boyfriend and I were terrified at the thought of being parents. We decided that if my pregnancy was viable, we would go through with an abortion. Lucky for us, it turned out to be ectopic so no other action was needed on our part. I don't think I needed the pregnancy to make things clear for me about where I stood, but I do think I needed it to make things clear to others. After the ectopic pregnancy, I decided to actively pursue getting a tubal ligation. It was performed in April, 2014 and that was the first moment that I truly felt childfree and in control of my reproductive health. -- Ulonda, 27, Ohio These accounts have been edited and condensed for clarity.

She is the author of the forthcoming book, \"Keep Marching.\" The views expressed here are her own.  (CNN) Tax plans can be hard to decipher, but with each passing day, women and moms across the country understand more clearly how the GOP tax plans \u2014 both the US Senate and the House versions -- will affect their families and our economy. At MomsRising, we hear from moms -- from Alaska to Alabama -- every day and they are telling us they are terrified. Over the last few weeks, we've seen rumblings of concern turn to full-fledged alarm about what this tax plan will mean for America's women. Their worries are certainly justified.  The GOP tax plans are the opposite of what women and our economy need. Women in the United States of America are already facing severe economic inequality at the exact same time as the cost of raising children, and the percentage of families who are relying on the wages of women to make ends meet, are rising quickly. Times have changed. For instance, women are now breadwinners in more than half of all families \u2014 and are the primary breadwinner in 42% of families, according to Pew; and over the past 30 years, childcare costs for working families have increased by 70%, according to Census Bureau data.", "Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner  Yet women on average earned just 80 cents to a man's dollar in 2017, with moms and women of color experiencing increased wage hits. Women are under financial duress even as our purchasing power is needed to fuel our economy. That's right: The vast majority of purchasing decisions are made by women in our country, where according to the World Bank, 70% of our GDP is now based on consumer spending.  Economic inequality for women is a huge weakness for our nation, and the GOP proposed tax plans in the US House and Senate could turn that disaster into a national calamity. Read More Want to know who will reap huge rewards under this plan? Ultrawealthy individuals and corporations who aren't hanging on by a thread. For instance, the top 0.1%, households with incomes over $3.1 million per year, would gain nearly $100,000 in tax cuts a year.  In stark contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates households making $75,000 or less a year, while likely to see modest cuts in the short term, will see a tax increase over the next decade under the Senate bill.  In fact, nonpartisan estimates reported by the National Women's Law Center found that over 75% of the GOP tax plan's benefits would go to the wealthiest 20% of households, while the bottom 20% would only receive around 2% of the benefits. Simply put, women and middle-class families would be further buried by this tax plan. It's appalling in both the House and Senate versions. It's a back-door evisceration of the health care coverage voters in every state in our nation have said they need. On childcare and many other measures, it's grossly insufficient.  The GOP tax plan amounts to a massive wealth shift in an economy that already has massive wealth inequality. Here's a reality check for the GOP: Our country is now the third worst nation in terms of income inequality \u2014 after Chile and Mexico \u2014 among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.", "Because of this rising wealth inequality, MIT economist Peter Temin recently pointed out that we're regressing to developing nation status. This doesn't bode well for our future economic success as a country. One example of how the House and Senate tax plans bolster income inequality is their treatment of \"pass through\" business income. Although \"pass through\" tax changes are being sold as a benefit to small businesses and Main Street, it turns out these changes would greatly benefit the already-wealthy -- like Donald Trump, who is lobbying for this -- while only about 2% of households with incomes below $100,000, the true small business owners, would get any tax benefit at all. In fact, it's the top 1% who gain the vast majority of the benefit from \"pass-throughs.\" This isn't Main Street being helped. This is Wall Street getting a handout. By doubling down on wealth inequality, the GOP tax plan would jeopardize the health, financial stability, and future of millions of women and families across our country while growing our national debt over the next decade by over $1.3 trillion in the House version; estimates on the Senate bill range from $1.4 to $1.6 trillion, according to the Penn-Wharton Budget Model. It will leave a legacy of debt our children will spend their lives trying to pay off.  The women of America know that it's not OK to raise taxes for millions of people while gutting essential provisions that boost our access to health care, education and housing, and that fuel our economy. That's not smart economic policy. We also know that it's not OK to starve the federal budget in ways that are sure to put Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Head Start and other essential programs on the chopping block. It's also not OK to pretend trickle-down economics is going to work now, when it never has before.  Join us on Twitter and Facebook The women of America also know these GOP tax plans don't reflect our values, don't recognize our contributions, and don't boost our economy. Most heartbreaking of all, we know that the GOP tax plan, which is being rushed through even though it's the most comprehensive tax reform bill in decades, takes an ax to the American dream for many of our children. Members of Congress who vote to pass the GOP tax plan do so at their own risk. Women are watching, counting this vote, and will remember this at re-election time. It's time for congressional Republicans to rethink their approach, invest in programs that help reduce income inequality and boost our economy, and open the doors to opportunity, instead of slam them shut."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

At 19 years old, lauded for his role with the \"untouchable\" championship-winning Kentucky Wildcats, he was taken with the sixth overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. He quickly made his presence felt at the next level, leading the Celtics in scoring (17.5 points per game) and rebounding (nine per game) en route to a spot on the NBA's All-Rookie First Team.  Over the next decade, he became an NBA Live cover athlete, a three-time All-Star, an NBA champion, and the recipient of over $108 million in contract money. In 2010, two years after he played his final NBA game, it was all gone. The temptations \u2014 the cars, the clothes, the pressure to help family and friends \u2014 that came with the fame and fortune caught up to Walker, and he was forced to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \"That process of me playing in the NBA created a very expensive lifestyle for myself,\" Walker told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview last month. \"I lived a very good lifestyle where I took care of not only myself, (but) my brothers and sisters. I was the oldest of six, so I watched my mom raise us by herself. I have two kids of my own ... and I brought friends along on the journey as well. I ran with a group of friends, seven or eight of us that grew up in the same neighborhood. I kind of took them on this journey with me throughout the NBA and made sure that they enjoyed the fruits of my labor too.\"", "Walker, who would never wear the same suit twice and owned more cars than he could count on one hand, accelerated his financial downfall when he dove into real estate. \"In the process of taking care of (friends and family) and myself and creating a lifestyle for myself, seven years into my career I decided I wanted to venture off into real estate,\" Walker said. \" ... Eventually, four years down the line, it ended up going bad. Recession hit, 2007, 2008. ... The downfall, the mistake that I made, was being the personal guarantor of the real estate company and putting up my personal financial portfolio in order to get these loans and this money.\" After spending over two years in bankruptcy, Walker was given a new lease on life, announcing in 2013 that he was debt free. Now, he's trying to \"change the narrative.\" In addition to working as an analyst for SEC Network and 120 Sports, Walker serves as a consultant to Morgan Stanley Global Sports and Entertainment, where he in 2014 helped launch a financial education program designed to steer young athletes down the proper path and prevent them from falling victim to the pitfalls he faced when he entered the NBA. As he travels across the country to share his cautionary tale, Walker says his goal is to \"make a really negative story into a positive story. \"But also, (to use this) platform to one: share my story, and two: educate young student athletes on finances, so when they do make this money, that they don't make the same mistakes that I made and really work hard and try to really change this thought process of athletes going broke.\" PHOTOS: Antoine Walker through the years", "Flip through the gallery to see Antoine Walker through the years.

(CNN) As the extraordinary vanities and profanities of the drama of President Donald Trump's inner circle combusting continue to crackle, those of us around the rest of the world can take comfort in one thing: at least he is busy. It's not a particularly popular view at a time of global discombobulation, but it is possible to see 2017 as having been \"not as bad as it could have been.\" The extraordinary unraveling of the White House's past and present staff members, resulting from the meteor strikes of Michael Wolff's book and Robert Mueller's investigation, has led to a kind of paralysis when it comes to foreign policy. The commander in chief has time to bark, but not necessarily to bite.", "Yes, we had the naming of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Kim Jong Un as a \"Little Rocket Man,\" and US-nemesis Vladimir Putin as \"very smart.\" But this is a foreign policy conducted minute by minute, over Twitter. In this field, at the least, it isn't coherent and rarely backed up with action. Even on Thursday, when @realdonaldtrump tweeted that North and South Korea wouldn't necessarily be talking if the US hadn't carried such a big stick of late, what we saw was the reputed product of more presidential bluster, not actual US armed action. Read More In fact, 2017 saw only two real moments of genuine foreign policy action that was Trump's and Trump's alone. First, he bombed the Syrian regime in response to a horrific chemical attack at Khan Sheikhoun. But the 59 cruise missiles were swift, hit a relatively distant part of the regime's military infrastructure, and were accompanied by a background message that it was almost certainly a one-off. It was like the 90s again, when Bill Clinton would bomb Saddam Hussein overnight because he wanted to send a message, but not actually start a war.", "JUST WATCHED Bannon gets cease and desist letter from Trump  Replay MUST WATCH  02:39 Second, he announced a policy in Afghanistan. Wars there are nothing new, but this was an actual moment of departure from -- say -- the script of the previous administration. Trump kept the ISIS war going pretty much as it was when he was inaugurated. In Afghanistan, he announced his own retweak of the almost decades old variations on strategy. And, most importantly, he declared winning as his goal. Like everyone before him, he may not get there. But he does own a policy. There are plenty of global crises where he could have been a lot more irrational or destabilizing. He hasn't upped US assistance to the Saudi Arabian side in the war in Yemen -- already claiming many civilian lives and causing an unprecedented famine.", "He didn't act militarily in or around North Korea. He's stayed out of Libya, mostly. And been mostly rhetorical about Venezuela. It could have been so, so much worse. Foreign policy and conflict does take a lot of planning and effort. Even wars that are bad ideas require plotting. Trump is often far too busy reacting to occasional slights to spend the time needed to devise and gain congressional support for proper sustained military action. He also has the firewall of experienced military generals around him: Mattis, McMaster and Kelly, who have all seen war and are hence not fans of it. 2018 has been described by some as a smorgasbord of potential geopolitical disasters, not seen for decades. That is true. Previous guaranteed norms are evaporating fast, often thanks to Trump's Twitter thumb. But what we have learned from 2017 is that, no matter how troublingly foreign policy can seem to be used as a distraction by this administration to its domestic woes, they don't have the time or the bandwidth to be that focused or damaging. Of course, that's no comfort in another Crimea or North Korean ICBM crisis. And it's no reason for broad comfort with the White House's foreign policy. But the distraction does limit what proactive moves they can make outside of America."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

In an April 2014 appearance on \"Live!

Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute.  Guttmacher defines abortion clinics as facilities where half or more of the patient visits are for abortion services. There are other clinics that provide abortions, called nonspecialized clinics, but fewer than half of the patient visits there are for abortion services.  Abortion rights advocates say \"TRAP\" laws -- or targeted regulation of abortion providers -- have resulted in fewer abortion clinics.  \"Some TRAP laws require that abortions be performed in far more complicated and expensive facilities than are necessary to ensure the provision of safe procedures,\" the Center for Reproductive Rights said.  \"These requirements may require costly and unnecessary facility modifications, which may not even be feasible in existing facilities, or impose unnecessary staffing requirements that are expensive or impossible to meet.\" Jones said there's another issue: finding enough doctors willing to perform abortions. Since 1994, anti-abortion extremists have killed at least 11 doctors and attempted to kill 26 doctors, the National Abortion Federation said. Arsonists have set fire to at least 39 clinics, and several others have been bombed.  \"If a physician retires, it might be difficult to find another physician who is willing to take over, potentially putting their life and the lives of their family members at risk -- risk of harassment, risk of stigma and risk of violence,\" she said. Six states are now down to one abortion clinic -- Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming, according to the Guttmacher Institute.", "Demonstrators protest outside the EMW Women's Surgical Center in Louisville. Kentucky could become the first with zero abortion clinics due to alleged shortcomings with the Louisville clinic's \"transfer agreement.\" Transfer agreements are written agreements between an abortion clinic and a hospital, saying the hospital agrees to accept the clinic's patients in case of emergency.  In the past, the EMW Louisville clinic's transfer agreement was signed by the head of a hospital's obstetrics/gynecology department. But now, the state says that signature isn't good enough -- the clinic needs the signature of a hospital president or CEO. And so far, no local hospital president nor CEO has agreed to sign a transfer agreement.  \"The standards are just outrageous,\" said Wells, who co-founded the EMW Louisville clinic. Wells and other critics of the state law say it's unnecessary because federal law requires emergency rooms to accept anyone who shows up -- with or without a \"transfer agreement.\" They believe the restriction is actually an attempt by Gov. Matt Bevin's administration to eliminate abortion services in Kentucky.  But Doug Hogan, spokesman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said the regulations are about women's health and safety.  \"The Bevin Administration is working diligently to protect the health, welfare and lives of women in Kentucky,\" Hogan said in a written statement.  \"The statutory requirement for transfer agreements -- which was enacted in 1998 and not questioned for 19 years -- is necessary to ensure women have access to life-saving procedures in the event of an emergency.\" When asked why EMW's transfer agreements were considered adequate in years past, but not this year, Hogan and a state health department spokeswoman did not respond to multiple requests for comment.", "Anti-abortion demonstrators protest outside the EMW Women's Surgical Center in Louisville. A federal judge is now considering whether requiring a hospital transfer agreement -- and a related ambulance transport agreement -- are constitutional. Whichever way US District Judge Greg Stivers decides, the outcome could get appealed, potentially to the Supreme Court.  And that could have a chilling effect across the country.  The growing pleas for help  The emails, phone calls, and texts rarely stop in Marcie Crim's office. She's the executive director of the Kentucky Health Justice Network, a non-profit that helps Kentuckians pay for abortions and the related travel expenses -- which keep rising as the number of clinics keep declining. \"Just this morning we bought a ($662) plane ticket to fly someone to New Mexico,\" said Crim, who became KHJN's first executive director last year.  The group regularly helps fly clients to New Mexico because there, women can get abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy. In Kentucky, abortions are legal until 20 weeks after fertilization or 22 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period. That limit can make a huge difference -- especially since the results of genetic abnormality testing might not come back until well into the second trimester.  \"The majority of folks who get a late-term abortion are for high-risk (cases) or for fetal abnormalities,\" Crim said.  Those aren't the only reasons for late-term abortions. In February, Crim helped fly another woman to New Mexico after she had been repeatedly raped by the same attacker.  \"She finally figured out she was pregnant. She didn't realize how far along she was because she was raped repeatedly,\" Crim said. The woman tried to get an abortion at the EMW Louisville clinic, but was denied because it turned out she was 24 weeks pregnant.  \"So we flew her to New Mexico ... that was really heartbreaking,\" Crim said. \"We get cases of rape and incest more often than we'd like.\" The majority of KHJN Support Fund clients are Kentuckians who can't afford to get abortions in their own state due to \"constant barriers,\" Crim said.  One of those barriers is Kentucky's 24-hour waiting period -- meaning a patient must consult with the clinic at least 24 hours before the procedure.  It's not a big deal for women who work salaried jobs and can easily take time off work, drive across the state and pay for a hotel during that waiting period. But it's a huge deal for hourly employees who have no sick days and don't even have a car to drive across the state to get to a clinic.  Kentucky does allow the 24-hour consultations to take place by videoconference, but that still doesn't help rural, impoverished women, Crim said.  \"We like to think everyone has high-speed internet access in their homes, but not everyone does,\" she said.  While the KHJN helps women with transportation and lodging costs, the most common request is for help paying for the actual procedure.  About 95% of KHJN's clients go to the lone clinic in Kentucky, where a medical abortion (for up to nine weeks of pregnancy) is $750. The cost of an abortion near the legal limit is $2,050, Crim said.  And the need for KHJN's financial aid, which is funded by donors, would \"skyrocket\" if 100% of the clients had to go out of state, Crim said.  She recalled the haunting words of a 16-year-old who couldn't afford to travel and was denied an abortion in Kentucky because she was almost 23 weeks pregnant.  \"Fine, I'll just do it myself,\" Crim recalled the teen saying. \"I've looked it up online. I can do it myself.\" Crim's agency managed to find the funding to help the girl get an abortion. But as a woman who has had an abortion herself, Crim said she's terrified of what will happen if the EMW clinic shuts down.  \"It makes me want to cry,\" she said. \"It takes me to an emotional place, because of my own experience with abortion and trying to put myself in the shoes of somebody who's pregnant and scared and ... feel like they have absolutely no option.\" The options at A Woman's Choice Some abortion critics have actually had abortions -- and they want to tell other women it's not the best choice. \"If I could go back and change my decision, I would,\" said 36-year-old Nici, who asked that only her first name be used.  \"I chose abortion because I didn't see any other way out. It seemed like my only option.\"", "Nici said she was traumatized after getting an abortion in her early 20s. She now helps other women in similar situations. She was about 23 when it happened.  Her boyfriend's mother paid for the abortion. And for the next decade, Nici said, she suffered a horrific mix of guilt, shame, \"cold sweat nightmares and anger -- just unexplainable anger.\"  \"It's just a really dark place to be in,\" Nici said. \"It's all because I took that life, I severed that connection. And you feel it. You know. It's not just a glob of tissue. There is a connection. I could feel the heartbeat.\"  Sherri Churchill's mother forced her to have an abortion at age 15. For most of the last three decades, she said, the psychological trauma has been relentless.  \"We had no idea what the side effects and the outcome would be after an abortion,\" Churchill said. \"And what I know now that I didn't know then is abortion hurts women. Abortion psychologically hurts women. And I know that for myself because I went through it.\" Churchill said she tried to ease the pain with drugs, alcohol and physical relationships. \"I was in very, very unhealthy relationships, and the drugs and alcohol was to stuff the pain,\" she said.  Now 48, Churchill is a counselor at A Woman's Choice Resource Center, which counsels women to choose alternatives to abortion.", "Sherri Churchill said she just recently made peace with her mother, who forced her to have an abortion when she was 15. The facility is right next to Kentucky's lone abortion clinic. A large sign in front of A Woman's Choice advertises free pregnancy testing, pre- and post-abortion counseling and ultrasounds.  Given its name and proximity to EMW, patients might confuse A Woman's Choice for the abortion clinic. That's not a coincidence.  \"We're definitely pro-life,\" said Monica Henderson, executive director of A Woman's Choice and Necole's Place -- a sister facility that offers parenting classes and other life skills courses.  Both facilities are merging this month under a new name, BsideU for Life Pregnancy & Life Skills Center. They're expanding to a new location, but will keep a facility next to the abortion clinic.  \"We located strategically near EMW so that women would know there's another option,\" Henderson said.", "A Woman's Choice Resource Center, right, has been located next to the EMW abortion clinic for seven years.  When one client, Cassandra, walked into A Woman's Choice pregnant and panicked, she did not have the means to raise a child.  \"I came here with nothing. I didn't know how I was going to make it work,\" said Cassandra, who only wanted to be identified by her first name. \"I didn't have a chair to sit in when I was pregnant. I came to A Woman's Choice asking, 'Do you all have a chair? Can you get me a chair for my house?' \"", "Cassandra decided against having an abortion and wants other women to know they can handle motherhood, too. April Hickman was in a worse predicament -- she was homeless when she went to an emergency room to take a pregnancy test.  A doctor broke the news: \"You're pregnant. Do you want to be pregnant? ... If you don't, we have a pill that you can take.\"  Hickman said she considered it. But that night, she had a dream about a little girl with a bright smile. And the next morning, she went to A Woman's Choice.  \"When I got in for the orientation, it was then that I decided I'm going to keep this baby,\" Hickman said. \"I took parenting classes to learn how to be a better parent. ... I was afraid of having this baby because I screwed up so bad, and I was so afraid. But everybody loved me when I came and needed wipes or Pampers.\"", "April Hickman was asked if she wanted an abortion when she was pregnant with Marlee, right. Marlee now has a 2-year-old sister, Michilee. Hickman is now the mother of a 3-year-old girl, Marlee. Cassandra also has a 3-year-old -- a son named Theodore, which means \"a gift from God.\" Both mothers, along with Nici, now help other women at Necole's Place. \"Coming here helped me enjoy being a mom even more because I know I'm not alone,\" Cassandra said. \"The responsibility of being a mother is not all on my shoulders.\" Nici and Cassandra declined to say whether they want Kentucky's last abortion clinic to close. But Cassandra said that outcome would allow her to help more women at Necole's Place. \"I think we would have more women to support,\" she said. \"And we'd have to start planning to help more people.\" 'It's more common than people believe' Anna Collins, 32, is a successful business owner, homeowner and philanthropist. She says none of that would have been possible if she hadn't had an abortion.  Collins was 20 years old, working a \"very low-level, non-skilled labor job\" in a cafe. She made about $9 an hour -- barely enough to support herself.  The financial stress was compounded by emotional stress when her boyfriend broke up with her. Shortly after that, she learned she was pregnant.  \"We were using contraceptives. We were not intending to get pregnant,\" she said. \"The only thing that I can come up with is that the condom broke. We just didn't realize it.\"  It took Collins several days before she decided to have an abortion.", "Anna Collins said her abortion allowed her to finish massage therapy school and start her own business. \"The longer I thought about it, the more I didn't want to bring a child into this world that I couldn't financially support, that I couldn't emotionally support,\" Collins said. \"I would definitely have had to go on government assistance at that time.\" So she went to the EMW clinic. And to this day, she says it was one of the best decisions of her life.  \"In the last 12 years, I've been able to go to massage school, buy a house, start my own business,\" she said. \"I've been able to donate my time and money to organizations that I believe in.\" Collins has housed friends who have fallen on hard times and regularly shelters rescue animals. She used to volunteer as an escort at the EMW clinic, but her massage therapy business is doing so well that she no longer has time to volunteer on Saturdays.  \"I think of all the wonderful, beautiful things that I've been able and lucky enough to do in life, and I can't imagine doing any of those with a child -- or especially having a child before I was able to go to school,\" she said.  Now, she worries the freedom she enjoyed is eroding. Collins said she's \"ashamed\" that her state could become the first with no abortion clinics.  \"I love my country, I love my state. I want Kentucky to be known for things that I'm proud of, and not for being the first state to take accessibility to abortion away from women,\" she said.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 5,000 abortions took place in Kentucky and more than 650,000 took place nationwide in 2013, the latest available year of data.  The demographics may be surprising: More than half the women who get abortions are Catholic, mainline Protestant or evangelical Protestant, according to the Guttmacher Institute. \"I think that it's more common than people believe,\" Collins said. \"And I think that if people were more open to hearing personal stories, that they would realize how many people they know have had abortions. ... If you haven't had one, you know somebody who has. You just don't know that you know (them).\" They even include women who have protested outside the EMW abortion clinic. During her time as a clinic escort, Collins said she was surprised to see a woman who had frequently protested walk into the clinic herself.  Collins said she didn't judge.  \"We walk everyone in just the same, whether we recognize them or not,\" she said. \"I'd like to believe that made her realize that this is something that can happen to anybody.\" 'Shut it down' Across the state, in rural Warren County, Jennifer Fink sells clothes, furniture and appliances next to a gas station. With seven children, she's had to get creative about making ends meet.", "Jennifer Fink and her boyfriend JayJay Wilson sell some of Fink's belongings in Rockfield, Kentucky. (Holly Yan/CNN) \"I had to do what I had to do. I was a dancer for a little while,\" she said. \"You figure it out. When you love 'em, and you're a mom, you figure it out.\"  Fink knows how challenging motherhood can be, but she's thrilled about the possibility her state will have no more abortion clinics. \"I think it's awesome, because I would consider it murder,\" she said. \"Shut it down.\" That shouldn't stop with Kentucky's last clinic, she said. \"I would be happy if all of them were gone, everywhere.\" While opinions run the gamut in both rural and urban parts of the state, Fink's sentiment is a common one in southern Kentucky.  Fink said she knows contraceptives can fail -- some of her own pregnancies were unexpected -- but that's still no excuse for an abortion.  \"Don't have sex if you can't have a baby,\" she said.  The possible end of an era Before abortion was legalized nationwide in 1973, Dona Wells was already helping Kentuckians get abortions. She shuttled women to the airport so they could fly to New York, where abortions were already legal.  Then, not long after Roe v. Wade, Wells started working as a counselor at Kentucky's first recognized abortion clinic in 1974.  The demand for services was immense.", "Dona Wells shows a model of the female reproductive system used in explaining abortion procedures. \"When I was at RELSCO (abortion clinic), we used to see about 400 patients a month,\" said Wells, now 75. \"We were the only people doing abortions in Louisville.\"  The need was so severe that new clinics popped up across the state. And over the next four decades, Wells counseled thousands of women in several clinics.  \"I would say that I have probably ... provided abortion services in this country as long or longer than anybody has,\" she said.  She retired from her role as executive director at the EMW Louisville clinic in 2006. The clinic still performs about 250 abortions per month -- roughly half of which are medical abortions.  Wells knows she doesn't fit certain stereotypes about abortion rights activists. She's a mother of two who never wanted to have an abortion herself. She grew up Southern Baptist and attended Baptist and Catholic colleges. \"I took a lot of theology and religion and philosophy in school,\" she said. \"I do still call myself Southern Baptist.\"  But she said religion and abortion rights aren't mutually exclusive.  \"I think this is the Christian thing to do. We're all put here on this Earth to help each other,\" Wells said. \"And that's what I'm doing. That's my mission in life -- to be a support system for whatever people need.\"  Wells said when she co-founded the clinic in 1981, \"little did we know that they were going to figure out how to restrict (abortions) in a million different ways.\" Wells said Roe v. Wade doesn't need to be overturned to eliminate legal abortions in the country. All it takes is more state restrictions.  \"They're trying to restrict it in so many ways that you won't be able to get an abortion,\" she said. \"There will be nobody -- no clinics, no doctors, nobody to do abortions.\""]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

But whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating.  In fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar.", "But there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin.  \"Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old,\" said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of \"The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great.\" \"What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging.\"  Read More Sugar addiction  Here's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. \"People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar,\" Alpert said. \"We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more.\"", "JUST WATCHED How to tame a sweet tooth Replay MUST WATCH  01:05 About 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, research suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs.  One of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff.  \"People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night,\" Alpert said.  How to sugar detox: Going cold turkey for three days The good news is that even if you're not a true sugar \"addict,\" by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance.  \"There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets,\" Lustig said. Children can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days, every aspect of their metabolic health improved -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed.  But going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.", "\"Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clich\u00e9d and not effective,\" Alpert said. \"It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers. \"What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate,\" she said. \"They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to.\" So for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. \"You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats.\"  For example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee. Though they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. \"These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is,\" Alpert said.  Consuming artificial sweeteners causes \"you not only (to) store more fat,\" Lustig explained, \"you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage.\" How to sugar detox: When an apple tastes like candy Once the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple.  \"By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy,\" Alpert said. \"The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again.\"  Starting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. \"Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster,\" Alpert said.", "You can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too.  During week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash. For week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day. \"Week three should be quite livable,\" Alpert said. Week four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week.  \"You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier,\" Alpert said. \"I want people living. Week four is the way to do it.\" Week four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. \"Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one,\" Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days.  \"The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life,\" Alpert said. Benefits and cautions with slashing sugar Detoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. \"We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction,\" Alpert said. \"Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser!\"  Participants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings.", "Natural sweeteners", "Natural sweeteners Although maple syrup contains some vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the amounts in a typical serving are quite small.

She has been on the plan for approximately two years. \"I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes.\"  Diane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. \"This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal.\" There are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive.  \"Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue,\" Alpert said.

But he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.  Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there. His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound. \"I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,\" ten Hoopen said.  Read More With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.", "Photographer Pieter ten Hoopen The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.  One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.  \"This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,\" ten Hoopen said. The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees. The photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.  Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa. Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely. \"They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible,\" he said. \"I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective.\" The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well. \"I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,\" ten Hoopen said. He said some patients at the hospital \"had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio.\"  Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength. Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.  Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography. \"I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,\" he said. \"It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you.\"  How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?  \"It wasn't hard,\" he said. \"I just told them to relax and have fun. \"Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature.\" Pieter ten Hoopen is a photographer based in Stockholm, Sweden.

Photograph: John Amis/AP", "More than 100 people have died from swine flu and intensive care beds are filling up with victims, the government's chief medical officer revealed today. A sharp rise in the proportion of hospital patients needing critical care is a matter \"of some concern\", Sir Liam Donaldson admitted as he unveiled the national vaccination programme due to start next week. High-risk patients and frontline health workers in hospitals will be the first to be inoculated from 21 October. More than 4m doses of Pandemrix will be delivered to GP surgeries the following week so that patients in priority groups can be given protective injections. A national postal strike could disrupt the process severely, Donaldson warned, saying it could prevent doctors from sending out letters to vulnerable patients to invite them in for vaccination. \"We are worried about the postal strike,\" the chief medical officer said. \"GPs need to send letters out to patients. [A strike] would be an extremely unwelcome piece of timing. We need to get people into GPs' surgeries to give them this life-saving vaccine.\" There were about 27,000 new cases of swine flu last week, an increase on the 18,000 new cases in the previous week. There have now been 106 deaths in the UK connected to the virus: 83 in England, 15 in Scotland, four in Wales and four in Northern Ireland. Two of the latest people to die were pregnant women, a group emerging as a particularly at risk in the outbreak. David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department of Health, dismissed fears that the \"adjuvants\" \u2013 material added to the vaccine to boost the body's immune response \u2013 would harm pregnant women. The Pandemrix vaccine, he said, would provide virtually immediate immunity and guard against a broader spectrum of flu viruses. Freshly issued advice from the World Health Organisation today confirmed that \"the GSK [Pandemrix] vaccine has been licensed for use in pregnant women in Europe as of September 2009\". Salisbury promised, however, to review the data. There are 364 people in British hospitals with H1N1 swine flu, of whom 74 are in intensive care. \"This is the highest proportion [of hospital patients] needing critical care since this all began,\" Donaldson said. \"Most of the time it's been around 12% or 13%. Now it's up to 20%. \"We are seeing more serious cases than before but no sign of any change in the virus. This is giving me some concern. There's a school of thought that when a flu virus is operating in the summer it's milder than when it's operating in the flu season without a change in the virus. \"We don't understand why. We are doing a more detailed study of hospital patients,\" Donaldson said. The Ministry of Defence announced that 15,000 doses of the vaccine would be delivered to the 9,000 UK troops serving in Afghanistan. \"We can't afford to have soldiers off with flu if we can prevent that,\" said an MoD spokesman. No cases have yet been reported among servicemen there. The Department of Health is reviewing whether any other groups should be deemed high-risk categories and given early vaccinations against swine flu. Among the latest deaths was a pregnant teenager from southern Scotland, whose unborn child also died. The 17-year-old was being treated in a hospital in the Borders region. Her death was the latest in a series in Scotland: four deaths were reported in one 48-hour period earlier this week. Health officials in Wales said that a pregnant woman, aged 21, from Monmouthshire, died in intensive care after a planned caesarean section. Three deaths were reported in Wales in 24 hours. Six pregnant women have now died from the virus in the UK. Another pregnant woman who contracted the virus, Sharon Pentleton, has given birth to a son at Crosshouse hospital in Kilmarnock. In July, when she was six months pregnant, she was airlifted from Ayrshire for highly specialised treatment in Sweden which oxygenated her blood outside her body. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish health secretary, yesterday urged pregnant women to take the new H1N1 vaccine to ensure they had \"maximum protection\" for themselves and their babies. Vaccination schedule \u2022 21 October 415,000 doses of the vaccine Pandremix will be given to high-risk patients in hospitals and to frontline health workers. \u2022 Week beginning 26 October 4.4 million doses of Pandremix to be delivered to GPs. Doctors will inoculate patients in priority groups \u2013 such as those with compromised immune systems and pregnant women. \u2022 At the same time 236,500 doses of Pandremix and 49,200 doses of another vaccine, Celvapan, will be sent to NHS primary care trusts. \u2022 The World Health Organisation has backed the use of Pandremix for pregnant women despite claims ingredients have not been sufficiently tested on expectant mothers-to-be  Topics"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

(The concept exists pretty much everywhere--Florida's Sunpass, Illinois' I-PASS, California's FasTrak, etc.) It's a pretty ingenious invention: bearers of an E-ZPass transponder don't need to stop, wait in line, then dig out exact change to pay tolls, saving them time and hassle multiple times per road trip.  It's hard to believe there was ever a time when the E-ZPass program was anything but a seamless part of my daily commute and weekend road trips. I hope and believe that in the very near future, air travelers will feel the same way about TSA PreCheck. Like any new program, though, PreCheck has some perception challenges to overcome before this can happen. There are reports about travelers hesitating to enroll for a variety of reasons, including cost. Too, my friends who are enrolled in PreCheck hate when I publicly extoll the program, because they're afraid that the more people sign up, the longer those security lines will become. I, for one, recall feeling all of those things in the occasionally bumpy early days of E-ZPass. But that program's gargantuan success is a glimpse of what the future can be like for TSA PreCheck. Here are four reasons why.    1. Both process travelers faster.  Because drivers can whip through tollbooths, paying automatically, E-ZPass lanes can handle four times the traffic volume of a cash-only lane. Likewise, TSA PreCheck lanes usually process an impressive 300 passengers per hour and move, on average, twice as fast as the regular security lanes at airports. This is possible because travelers enrolled in TSA PreCheck don't need to remove their belts, jackets, shoes, laptops or \"3-1-1\" liquids at airport security.  2. Everyone benefits from E-ZPass and PreCheck--not just those enrolled.  From the beginning, E-ZPass has had visible benefits for everyone at the toll plaza. More E-ZPass users mean fewer people lining up to pay tolls the old-fashioned way, reducing delays for non-enrolled drivers. This effect is also apparent in airport security lines, especially after a recent surge in TSA PreCheck enrollment. This past Fourth of July weekend, TSA screened 10.7 million travelers, some days processing the highest number of travelers for that date since 2007. Despite this heavy traffic, all flyers waited less than ten minutes on average--and those in PreCheck usually waited less than five.  The recent airport security streamlining measures announced by the Department of Homeland Security, which include initiatives to increase TSA PreCheck enrollment, are starting to work--and all travelers are reaping the benefits.  TSA PreCheck even surpasses E-ZPass in an important respect: it keeps everyone safer. Because TSA PreCheck enrollees are pre-screened against multiple security databases, eliminating them as threats, TSA screeners can focus instead on unknown travelers who warrant more scrutiny. I've often said identifying terrorists is like finding a needle in a haystack, and the easiest way to do that is by \"shrinking the haystack.\"  3. Both save the government (and taxpayers) money.  New Jersey Turnpike officials, who oversee the busiest stretch of road in the Northeast, have stated that cash payments cost the government five to 10 times more to process because of staffing demands. Similarly, by rigorously pre-screening passengers, TSA PreCheck frees up valuable TSA personnel resources to focus on less-known travelers who may pose a potential threat. Taxpayers are already seeing savings from increased enrollment in PreCheck: TSA's chief risk officer testified to Congress last year that expanding PreCheck has saved the TSA $319 million in the past two years.  4. More travelers in E-ZPass means more lanes open--and the same goes for TSA PreCheck.  E-ZPass enrollment has grown exponentially since it first began--and that growth has allowed local governments to create more E-ZPass lanes, which reduce wait times for all drivers, and so on. It's the best kind of domino effect.  Here's where we find the most important similarity between E-ZPass and TSA PreCheck (one that assuages the fears of my aforementioned friends): TSA PreCheck is meant to expand along with its enrollment. The more flyers sign up for PreCheck, the more money that saves TSA to dedicate more lanes and personnel to PreCheck. To use another metaphor, TSA PreCheck is not like your favorite neighborhood restaurant, where more people mean bigger crowds and longer waits. Like E-ZPass, if travelers continue to grow the program, TSA PreCheck lanes will soon be ubiquitous at airports, outnumbering the \"regular\" security lines--and the entire airport security experience will be safer and more efficient for everyone."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Credit Peter DaSilva for The New York Times", "Hoping to give new meaning to the term \u201cnatural light,\u201d a small group of biotechnology hobbyists and entrepreneurs has started a project to develop plants that glow, potentially leading the way for trees that can replace electric streetlamps and potted flowers luminous enough to read by. The project, which will use a sophisticated form of genetic engineering called synthetic biology, is attracting attention not only for its audacious goal, but for how it is being carried out. Rather than being the work of a corporation or an academic laboratory, it will be done by a small group of hobbyist scientists in one of the growing number of communal laboratories springing up around the nation as biotechnology becomes cheap enough to give rise to a do-it-yourself movement. The project is also being financed in a D.I.Y. sort of way: It has attracted more than $250,000 in pledges from about 4,500 donors in about two weeks on the Web site Kickstarter. The effort is not the first of its kind. A university group created a glowing tobacco plant a few years ago by implanting genes from a marine bacterium that emits light. But the light was so dim that it could be perceived only if one observed the plant for at least five minutes in a dark room. The new project\u2019s goals, at least initially, are similarly modest. \u201cWe hope to have a plant which you can visibly see in the dark (like glow-in-the-dark paint), but don\u2019t expect to replace your light bulbs with version 1.0,\u201d the project\u2019s Kickstarter page says. But part of the goal is more controversial: to publicize do-it-yourself synthetic biology and to \u201cinspire others to create new living things.\u201d As promising as that might seem to some, critics are alarmed at the idea of tinkerers creating living things in their garages. They fear that malicious organisms may be created, either intentionally or by accident. Two environmental organizations, Friends of the Earth and the ETC Group, have written to Kickstarter and to the Agriculture Department, which regulates genetically modified crops, in an effort to shut down the glowing plant effort. The project \u201cwill likely result in widespread, random and uncontrolled release of bioengineered seeds and plants produced through the controversial and risky techniques of synthetic biology,\u201d the two groups said in their letter demanding that Kickstarter remove the project from its Web site.", "Arabidopsis, the first plant test subject. Credit Peter DaSilva for The New York Times", "They note that the project has pledged to deliver seeds to many of its 4,000 contributors, making it perhaps the \u201cfirst-ever intentional environmental release of an avowedly \u2018synthetic biology\u2019 organism anywhere in the world.\u201d Kickstarter told the critics to take up their concerns with the project\u2019s organizers. The Agriculture Department has not yet replied. Antony Evans, the manager of the glowing plant project, said in an interview that the activity would be safe. \u201cWhat we are doing is very identical to what has been done in research laboratories and big institutions for 20 years,\u201d he said. Still, he added, \u201cWe are very cognizant of the precedent we are setting\u201d with the do-it-yourself project and that some of the money raised would be used to explore public policy issues. Synthetic biology is a nebulous term and it is difficult to say how, if at all, it differs from genetic engineering. In its simplest form, genetic engineering involves snipping a gene out of one organism and pasting it into the DNA of another. Synthetic biology typically involves synthesizing the DNA to be inserted, providing the flexibility to go beyond the genes found in nature. The glowing plant project is the brainchild of Mr. Evans, a technology entrepreneur in San Francisco, and Omri Amirav-Drory, a biochemist. They met at Singularity University, a program that introduces entrepreneurs to futuristic technology. Dr. Amirav-Drory runs a company called Genome Compiler, which makes a program that can be used to design DNA sequences. When the sequence is done, it is transmitted to a mail-order foundry that synthesizes the DNA. Kyle Taylor, who received his doctorate in molecular and cell biology at Stanford last year, will be in charge of putting the synthetic DNA into the plant. The research will be done, at least initially, at BioCurious, a communal laboratory in Silicon Valley that describes itself as a \u201chackerspace for biotech.\u201d The first plant the group is modifying is Arabidopsis thaliana, part of the mustard family and the laboratory rat of the plant world. The organizers hope to move next to a glowing rose. Scientists have long made glowing creatures for research purposes, including one or more monkeys, cats, pigs, dogs and worms. Glowing zebra fish have been sold in some aquarium shops for years.", "Mr. Taylor, left, is lead scientist of the glowing plant project, and Mr. Evans its manager. Credit Peter DaSilva for The New York Times", "These creatures typically have the gene for a green fluorescent protein, derived from a jellyfish, spliced into their DNA. But they glow only when ultraviolet light is shined on them. Others going back to the 1980s have transplanted the gene for luciferase, an enzyme used by fireflies, into plants. But luciferase will not work without another chemical called luciferin. So the plants did not glow unless luciferin was constantly fed to them. In 2010, researchers at Stony Brook University reported in the journal Plos One that they had created a tobacco plant that glowed entirely on its own, however dimly. They spliced into the plant all six genes from a marine bacterium necessary to produce both luciferase and luciferin. Alexander Krichevsky, who led that research, has started a company, BioGlow, to commercialize glowing plants, starting with ornamental ones, since it is still impractical to replace light bulbs. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like your beautiful flowers to glow in the dark?\u201d he said, invoking the glowing foliage in the movie \u201cAvatar.\u201d Dr. Krichevsky declined to provide more about the products, timetables or the investors backing his company, which is based in St. Louis. Whether it will ever be possible to replace light bulbs remains to be seen and depends to some extent on how much of the plant\u2019s energy can be devoted to light production while still allowing the plant to grow. Mr. Evans said his group calculated, albeit with many assumptions, that a tree that covers a ground area of 10 meters (nearly 33 feet) by 10 meters might be able to cast as much light as a street lamp. While the Agriculture Department regulates genetically modified plants, it does so under a law covering plant pests. BioGlow has already obtained a letter from the department saying that it will not need approval to release its glowing plants because they are not plant pests, and are not made using plant pests. The hobbyist project hopes to get the same exemption. Todd Kuiken, senior research associate at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, who has been studying the governance of both synthetic biology and the do-it-yourself movement, said the glowing plant project was an ideal test case. \u201cIt exposes the gaps and holes in the regulatory structure, while it is, I would argue, a safe product in the grand scheme of things,\u201d Dr. Kuiken said. \u201cA serious look needs to be taken at the regulatory system to see if it can handle the questions synthetic biology is going to raise.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on May 8, 2013, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Dream of Trees Aglow at Night."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Do we owe the dead a small plot of earth? A gravestone or an urn? A whispered prayer, a spray of flowers, or some other means by which we signal to the great silence that we remember? These are among the many questions raised by a continuing scandal in Ireland that is the focus of a New York Times special report called \u201cThe Lost Children of Tuam.\u201d Though well-known in that country, the disturbing case, involving the historic mistreatment of unwed Irish mothers and their children, is less familiar beyond Irish shores. The scandal was exposed in 2014 by Catherine Corless, a determined woman with no press or academic credentials. At the matter\u2019s troubled core are the deaths of nearly 800 \u201cillegitimate\u201d children at the since-demolished Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway, from 1925 to 1961. Institutions like the one in Tuam were created nearly a century ago to rehabilitate \u201cfallen\u201d women and their offspring, with management given to the Catholic Church, whose moralistic teachings dictated much of Irish life. In March, two colleagues \u2014 Kassie Bracken, a senior video producer, and Megan Specia, a story editor for the International section \u2014 and I became intrigued by a significant development in the protracted scandal. Before long, the story of Tuam was being added to a series by The Times on how death is experienced and processed around the world. I thought I was a natural for this story. I\u2019ve been to Ireland many times and spent a summer there as a Times correspondent. What\u2019s more, my mother was from a County Galway crossroads about 35 miles from Tuam. But it didn\u2019t take long for me to be reminded, yet again, that the chasm of presumption and misunderstanding between Irish America and Ireland is as deep as the Atlantic. Just to understand the history of the stone building that served as the mother and baby home required that I learn more about the development of mid-19th century workhouses, the local impact of the famine known as the Great Hunger, and the Irish war for independence (as well as the civil strife that followed). But as Conall \u00d3 F\u00e1tharta, an investigative reporter for The Irish Examiner, repeatedly told me, the case\u2019s implications extended well beyond the eternal whereabouts of hundreds of children who died at the Tuam home. There had been other mother and baby homes around the country, all connected to what many historians say was part of a system that subjugated vulnerable women \u2014 a system that also included the notorious institutions known as the Magdalen Laundries. And what of the children they were often forced to abandon? There were many more deaths, shadowy adoptions, medical experiments and painful marginalization. To this day, many adult \u201chome babies\u201d are trying to learn what happened to their mothers. I was paralyzed: The story seemed too complex to be contained in even in an uncommonly long newspaper article. In total, I would interview about three dozen people, but still I needed someone to lead me \u2014 and the reader \u2014 through this maze of distant and modern Ireland. Of course, she was right in front of me: Ms. Corless, that woman with no credentials, a gardener and grandmother whose determination had unearthed a troubling part of the past and forced a national reckoning. I spent several days with the shy Ms. Corless, who patiently recounted her reporting. Tracking down archival documents and maps. Conducting dozens of interviews. Refusing to accept pat answers from those in power. Ms. Corless told me that she was motivated by the thought of all those children who deserved to be remembered. Ireland, she said, owed them at least that. As I sat in her kitchen one day, sipping tea and eating a slice of apple tart, Ms. Corless answered a number of telephone calls from adult \u201chome babies\u201d now trying to track down relatives. She shared the information she had, promised to do more digging, and was, without fail, patient, even comforting. After 35 years in journalism, all I could do was listen and learn.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times", "Donald Trump has been trying to celebrate his one-year anniversary as president, and all he gets is terrible political news. His party got skunked in Tuesday\u2019s elections, his associates keep getting tied to the Russians and the Republicans in Congress are flailing around like a bunch of panicked gerbils. Hehehehe. In the latest episode of Cabinet Members off the Rails: the sorrows of Wilbur Ross Jr. A new investigative report detailed connections between Ross and a shipping group linked to Vladimir Putin\u2019s son-in-law. Even worse, Forbes announced it was taking Ross off its list of richest Americans, concluding that most of the $3.7 billion Ross told the magazine he owned was fictional. Something must be done. If there is anyone who doesn\u2019t belong in the top levels of American government, it\u2019s a guy pretending to be a billionaire when he really isn\u2019t. The Trump campaign adviser Carter Page made quite a splash with his rambling, six-hour-plus testimony before a congressional committee that demonstrated not only that he had been in contact with Russians during the campaign, but also that the man Trump picked to be one of his top coaches on foreign policy issues is \u2026 sort of nuts. \u201cI am not a smooth Russian speaker. Maybe you could say that about my English as well,\u201d explained the former college lecturer with a doctorate from the University of London. One committee member described the whole performance as \u201creally eccentric behavior.\u201d And then came the elections! The biggest race was for governor of Virginia, where Trump had done robocalls and tweeted for the Republican, Ed Gillespie. When his candidate got trounced, Trump quickly and supportively announced that it was Gillespie\u2019s own fault for having failed to \u201cembrace me or what I stand for.\u201d The president did not mention the results in New Jersey, where voters rose up in revulsion to Chris Christie and elected a Democrat as his successor. You cannot entirely blame Trump for Christie\u2019s unpopularity, but the governor\u2019s nose-dive really did accelerate when the two of them started hanging out together. While a campaign observer might have imagined the nation was obsessed with immigrants and Confederate statues this season, it turned out the actual voters were way more concerned about health care. It was the thing Virginians brought up most often to election pollsters. In Maine, referendum voters demanded Obamacare expansion. And this month Obamacare enrollment season opened with a big surge of sign-ups despite the president\u2019s attempt to keep the enrollment opportunities more secret than his tax returns. Trump, however, is trying to attach an Obamacare repeal onto the Republican tax bill. It was only one of his helpful efforts to assist his party members in Congress. This week he also had a phone call with moderate Democrats, trying to promote the G.O.P. plan. Participants reported that he told them the original version of the bill was \u201cso bad for rich people, I had to throw in the estate tax just to give them something.\u201d People, how do you think the nation would respond to the idea that we have to get rid of the estate tax so rich people won\u2019t feel left out? Discuss. Trump also told the Democrats that his accountant had warned him he\u2019d lose a lot of money if the bill went through. Question: If you were a Democratic senator, how would you have responded? A) Show us your tax returns B) Show us your tax returns C) Show us your tax returns The president was abroad on Election Day, visiting South Korea and making preparations for a dramatic secret visit to the demilitarized zone. Which had to be canceled because it was raining. Really. There was bad weather and his helicopter turned around, leaving South Korean President Moon Jae-in waiting at the DMZ for the guest who never arrived. Moon apparently had no trouble making the trip because he drove. Trump also gave a speech to the South Korean Parliament \u2014 a success in the sense that he read stuff other people had written. As usual, he bragged about the stock market. The lawmakers looked as if they couldn\u2019t care less, and you have to wonder if this constant stock market talk is a good strategy. This week former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers offered that it was \u201ccrazy\u201d for the president to keep connecting himself to rising prices, since it was inevitable that they would drop again sooner or later. When that happens, do you think Trump will take responsibility? Refuse to acknowledge it\u2019s happening? Blame Barack Obama? Blame terrorism? Discuss. In another oratorical high point, the president managed, in a speech about the evils of North Korea, to work in a plug for one of his properties. (\u201cThe Women\u2019s U.S. Open was held this year at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., and it just happened to be won by a great Korean golfer. \u2026\u201d) Meanwhile, back home, Republicans in Congress are announcing their retirement plans in droves.

The Tennessee Poison Center has not received calls before about \"Dewshine.\" Seger said it was hard to say how prevalent it is and whether others were making it.   \"I think it was just a very unfortunate accident that happened,\" she said.

THE UNSETTLERS: In Search of the Good Life in Today\u2019s America, by Mark Sundeen. (Riverhead, $16.) Sundeen profiles three families \u2014 whom he calls pioneers, of a sort \u2014 who chose to live off the grid. They share an important commonality: \u201cThey had each taken on a fundamental aspect of how the world is broken, and had attempted, with all their might, to address it \u2014 in ways that felt sustainable, maybe even replicable.\u201d Enigma Variations, by Andr\u00e9 Aciman. (Picador, $16.) Aciman chronicles a lifetime of desire, love and loss. The central character, Paul, has an early infatuation with a craftsman in Italy that provides the story line\u2019s loose framework; the plot skips ahead to find him years later, nearly unrecognizable in an acrimonious relationship. Aciman\u2019s novel is a masterly portrayal of arousal and the selves forged by passion. Letters to V\u00e9ra, by Vladimir Nabokov. Edited and translated by Olga Voronina and Brian Boyd. (Vintage, $20.) For over 50 years, V\u00e9ra was a \u201csong,\u201d a muse, a protector for her husband. (She was the one to save an early draft of \u201cLolita\u201d after Vladimir tried to destroy it.) \u201cIt is the prose itself that provides the lasting affirmation,\u201d our reviewer, Martin Amis, wrote, \u201cand underlying it all the lavishness, the freely offered gift, of his divine energy.\u201d Long Black Veil, by Jennifer Finney Boylan. (Broadway, $16.) It\u2019s August 1980, and a band of college friends are looking for mischief in an abandoned Philadelphia prison. But when one of them goes missing, the night ends in tragedy. Years later, the student\u2019s body is found, and one of the survivors risks exposing two long-held secrets to protect the truth. As our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, put it: \u201cTo the author, the prison is more than a setting, it\u2019s also a powerful symbol for the closeted life she once led.\u201d PRINCE CHARLES: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life, by Sally Bedell Smith. (Random House, $20.) A sympathetic portrait of Charles comes down squarely in his favor, particularly with regard to Diana. He emerges as a thoughtful, intellectually driven man in Bedell\u2019s telling. The author, who has written at length about the royal family, offers a cleareyed view of the monarchy, its privilege and its faltering morals. On Turpentine Lane, by Elinor Lipman. (Mariner, $14.99.) Faith Frankel is 32, perhaps more than a little bored, and has set down roots in her Massachusetts hometown. But mysterious objects in her new bungalow draw her into the neighborhood\u2019s past. Lipman\u2019s screwball romance is full of delightfully weird characters, from Faith\u2019s neo-hippie fianc\u00e9 to her father, an amateur artist churning out Chagall copies.", "A version of this list appears in print on January 21, 2018, on Page BR20 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: Paperback Row.

Brain imaging research suggests that being under stress may make you more compassionate to others who are struggling or in pain. That\u2019s because stress may activate a part of the brain associated with empathy.  How the study worked An international team of researchers measured the brain activity of 80 male participants, some of whom were given a stress test while others acted as a control group with no intervention. The stress test sounds hellish: Participants were instructed to solve difficult tasks under a deadline, all while receiving negative feedback on their performance. Researchers measured the participants\u2019 anxiety during this exercise by measuring their levels of the stress hormone, cortisol. Once sufficiently stressed, the study subjects looked at photos of strangers who were undergoing a painful medical procedure and were asked to imagine how the patient in each photograph felt. For some of the images, researchers told the participants that the patient in the photo had received anesthesia, indicating that the person didn\u2019t feel pain during the procedure. Researchers did this so they could determine whether the study participants\u2019 reactions were to the image of the procedure or were based in an understanding of the patient\u2019s experience. The control group also looked at the photos. The study found that stressed participants displayed more empathy toward the photographed patients. Even when the individuals were informed that the patients weren\u2019t in pain, they still had an empathetic reaction, according to scans done of the \u201cempathy\u201d neural center in the brain.  Stress compels people to help others The study also aimed to measure if stress not only helped people empathize with others who were struggling, but if it compelled them to act on that empathy. After the participants were purposefully stressed out and looked at images of people in pain, researchers then had volunteers play a game designed to measure whether or not these emotions would make them more altruistic. The exercise, a behavioral economics game called \u201cthe dictator game,\u201d required individuals to divide a sum of money between themselves and strangers in whatever ratio they chose to use. The results showed the amount of neural activity a person had in the empathy network of the brain also correlated with how much money the participants gave away in the dictator game. The more empathetic a person was in the first test, the more money that person shared with others in this test. What this all means The results of the study indicate that people may have stronger emotional reactions when they\u2019re under stress and may be more likely to behave altruistically.  But this reaction may not always be beneficial: The researchers were surprised to find that the study participants felt pain on behalf of patients they were told were under anesthesia as well as those they were told were in pain.  This suggests empathetic reactions under stress may \u201cresult in aid that is uncalled for or inappropriate,\u201d study researcher Claus Lamm of the University of Vienna, said in a statement. For example, a stressed person may react with alarm when someone is crying out of joy.  \u201c[D]epending on the context and situation, stress can be either beneficial or detrimental in social situations,\u201d Lamm added. There are also some other caveats. The study sample was small, for one, and it was also only conducted on men. It\u2019s difficult to say if these results can apply to the whole population. That being said, as Science of Us pointed out last year, there\u2019s a whole body of research that supports the notion that the jitters can help people succeed under pressure. A 2013 study found that reframing performance-related anxiety in the mind as excitement can help people do better in the task. Other research found that students who were told their anxiety over a test would help them get better scores actually ended up with better results on the exam than those who weren\u2019t told their stress would help. In other words, while stress might be uncomfortable, there are times where it can be a force for good. At least something positive can come from it, right?"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Mr. Museveni is in his fifth presidential term. Credit Ben Curtis/Associated Press", "NAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 After months of heated, sometimes violent debate, Uganda\u2019s Parliament voted late Wednesday to lift the age limit for the presidency, setting the stage for President Yoweri Museveni to rule the country indefinitely. Mr. Museveni is in his fifth presidential term, which expires in 2021. By then, he will be 77 \u2014 two years past the age limit for a president set by Uganda\u2019s 1995 Constitution. A majority of lawmakers supported the bill, which passed 315 to 62 late Wednesday night, but a majority of Ugandans opposed it. A September poll by Afrobarometer found that 75 percent of respondents wanted to keep the age limit. Once Mr. Museveni signs the bill, it will become law. It is expected to be challenged in court. The final days of parliamentary debate on the bill included accusations that soldiers were hiding inside Parliament\u2019s chapel, where some lawmakers said they uncovered dishware and bottles filled with urine, suggesting that the soldiers may have planned an extended stay. \u201cThe process is a military coup,\u201d said Joe Oloka-Onyango, a professor of constitutional law at Makerere University in Kampala, the capital. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely illegitimate and illegal. It has been surrounded by violence and intimidation.\u201d In late September, Betty Nambooze, a member of Parliament who opposed the bill, was attacked inside a government building by unidentified men. She spent a month in the hospital and was eventually flown to India for surgery. One person was killed in street protests in October and two members of Parliament were hospitalized after inhaling tear gas at a rally held after the police banned \u201cillegal\u201d public demonstrations on the matter. Mr. Museveni\u2019s supporters said the bill would eliminate age discrimination in electoral politics, but critics said that argument was a red herring. \u201cIt\u2019s really not even about age,\u201d Mr. Oloka-Onyango said. \u201cIt\u2019s about accommodating Museveni\u2019s ego and lust for power. At each instance, he has changed the goal posts that would have led to his peaceful replacement.\u201d In 2005, as Mr. Museveni\u2019s second \u2014 and, by the old rules, final \u2014 term neared its end, Parliament abolished the presidential term limit. His electoral victories since then have drawn legal challenges. \u201cThe writing was always on the wall, but unfortunately we didn\u2019t read it closely enough,\u201d said Jacqueline Asiimwe, a lawyer and feminist activist. \u201cThe original intent was to rule for life.\u201d The bill will also lower the age of eligibility for president, to 18 from 35, but young people in Uganda nevertheless vocally opposed it, and they form Uganda\u2019s biggest constituency. Nearly 70 percent of the country\u2019s population is under 25. A majority of them are unemployed, and they have known only one president: Mr. Museveni came to power in 1986, after his rebel group toppled an authoritarian leader. \u201cI\u2019m scared for my future,\u201d said Godiva Akullo, 27, a lawyer in Kampala who opposed the bill. \u201cWhen will this country be a place that I am proud to live and work in? Will my children, if I have any, be in this same position I am in, as the child of my parents: Will they wonder what I did when this man was doing all this?\u201d The bill has its roots in a challenge to Mr. Museveni\u2019s 2016 election victory. In a ruling that affirmed his victory, the Supreme Court laid out areas for electoral reform before the next campaign. None had to do with the president\u2019s age. \u201cThe fundamental point is that for a long time, we\u2019ve been talking about a review of some of the constitutional provisions that are important for ensuring we have a stronger democratic culture,\u201d said Richard Sewakiryanga, executive director of the Uganda National NGO Forum in Kampala, a nonpartisan watchdog group. \u201cThat\u2019s the genesis.\u201d But Wednesday\u2019s vote, Mr. Sewakiryanga said, is just about keeping Mr. Museveni in power. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way of seeing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one-way traffic.\u201d Lydia Namubiru contributed reporting from Kampala, Uganda."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

She could end education as we know it                         \u2018If DeVos\u2019s nomination is approved, she will speed along the erosion of public education.\u2019 Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP", "Donald Trump, a self-described billionaire, wants billionaire heiress Betsy DeVos to take over the Department of Education. These two ultra-rich people have never attended public schools. Nor have they sent their kids to them. Yet they will likely accelerate the bipartisan dismantling of public education as we know it.  Private foundations, billionaires and Wall Street hedge fund managers have funneled billions of dollars either directly into the education system or the political process to influence policy. These groups are often staunch advocates of pro-market policies such as charter schools and school vouchers, which allows parents to send their kids to private schools using public money. DeVos has been described as \u201cthe four-star general of the voucher movement\u201d. If DeVos\u2019s nomination is approved, she will speed along the erosion of public education, which has been going on for some time. As I explain in my recent book, Schools on Trial, both the Obama and Bush administrations adopted a market-based approach. This was marked by privatization, austerity measures, expansion of privately managed charter schools, high-stakes standardized testing, school closures, value-added teacher evaluations and attacks on teachers unions. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and Race to the Top program in 2009 were rooted in this ideology.  Over the past two decades, as members of the ultra-wealthy rightwing DeVos family, Betsy and her husband, Dick, have been discreetly using their immense fortune to underwrite many of the major local and state crusades to privatize public education. They helped pass Michigan\u2019s first charter school law, pushed a failed Michigan school voucher referendum, helped get hundreds of pro-voucher and charter candidates for public office elected, proliferated charters, weakened teachers unions by advocating for right-to-work legislation in Michigan and warded off a proposed Detroit charter oversight commission in a state where 80% are run for profit with minimal accountability. There are several flaws with vouchers. Their logic is based on empowering the individual over the state, rather than making systemic changes to funding, curriculum, assessment and teaching to achieve a high-quality, humane and equitable public system for all. Vouchers also siphon funds away from a cash-starved public system.  What\u2019s more, studies have shown that school choice experiments in Chile and Sweden exacerbated existing inequalities. If we are to improve educational outcomes for all children, decades of research show that we must address the miserable social and economic conditions that profoundly affect schools: poverty, homelessness, inadequate healthcare, unsafe drinking water, food insecurity and gun violence. Reformers such as DeVos are not keen on the state redistributing their wealth to cure those ills.  On the campaign trail, Trump unveiled a $20bn school choice grant initiative so that poor children can attend any school of their family\u2019s liking including charter and private schools. This served as the centerpiece of his plot to blow up the \u201cgovernment-run education monopoly\u201d. Nominating DeVos shows that he\u2019s committed to accomplishing this. In cities like New Orleans with only charter schools in operation, much of their scheme has been pulled off.  Obama\u2019s Race to the Top competition incentivized states to open up more charters. Indeed, that was a central plank of former secretary Arne Duncan\u2019s legacy when he was CEO of Chicago public schools. In the past decade, Journey for Justice has found that hundreds of public schools have been shuttered in black and Latino communities by Democratic politicians and charters have often taken their place.  The problem with this is that many charters are deeply segregated, push out low-performing and misbehaving students, and have been accused of \u201cfinancial fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement\u201d totaling more than $200m in a single 12-month span. Moreover, the Obama administration preserved and expanded Washington DC\u2019s private school voucher program, which was originally launched by former president George W Bush.  DeVos will find many allies across the aisle in Washington, from Senator Cory Booker (who served on the board of the Alliance for School Choice, of which she was chairman) to the Center for American Progress to Democrats for Education Reform. At least she is forthright about gutting public education, as she wrote in an editorial urging to abolish and replace Detroit\u2019s public schools with a free-market system, whereas Democrats hide behind the guise of \u201ccivil rights\u201d and \u201ceducational opportunity\u201d. How should public education supporters respond? First, teachers unions must adopt what scholar Lois Weiner calls \u201csocial movement unionism\u201d, in which members build coalitions for educational, racial, economic and social justice. It is the only way we will able to expose the corporate school reform agenda, fend off attacks on multiple fronts and organize for progressive victories. Otherwise, the unions will be crushed. We need to employ the tactics of the Chicago Teachers Union and engage in direct action such as strikes and walkouts.  Additionally, progressives need to collaborate on a platform that we can rally the public behind. Some of the items should include: a \u201cNew Deal\u201d for public education: a multibillion-dollar investment into working-class communities; creating thousands of community schools which offer a whole child pedagogical approach and provide wrap-around services; end to high-stakes testing, abolition of corporal punishment and implementing restorative justice. There is little public appetite for neighborhood schools to be sold off and privatized. See the referendum victories in Massachusetts and Georgia (against charter expansion) and California (extension of tax hikes on the rich to fund education), the Movement for Black Lives and NAACP demanding a moratorium on public school closures and charter expansion, the thousands of parents who have opted their children out of tests and protests against corporate reforms.  Unfortunately, the Obama years sowed the seeds for DeVos to finish the task. Without well-organized resistance, it will happen.

Maten made 12-of-17 free throws and finished with 12 rebounds in Georgia\u2019s 84-66 win over Temple on Friday. \u201cMaten did a great job on a number of plays,\u201d said Dunphy afterward. \u201cI still thought we controlled Maten really well.\u201d Maten moved into the top 10 in career scoring at Georgia with 1,472 points, passing D.A. Layne and Sundiata Gaines. He is one of only four Bulldogs to rank in the top 10 in both points and rebounds, along with Alec Kessler, Bob Lienhard and Terry Fair. Georgia (9-2) is off to its best start since winning 12 of 14 to start the 2010-11 season. Freshman Nicolas Claxton came off the bench to score a career-high 14 points and William Jackson II scored 10. \u201cYante has more game than he showed,\u201d said Fox. \u201cHe is in great physical shape, and he lets the game come to him.\u201d Inevitably, Maten\u2019s jump hook sets up the rest of his game. \u201cHe has a hook over both shoulders,\u201d Fox said. \u201cHe has learned that in practice in the gym, hours and hours of repetition.\u201d \u201cIt is one of the building blocks of my game,\u201d said Maten. He credited assistant coach Jonas Hayes with helping him. Obi Enechionyia led Temple (7-4) with 27 points. Quinton Rose scored 13. After Temple took an early 7-2 lead, the Owls went stone cold, missing 10 of their next 11 shots as Georgia went on a 17-2 run, grabbing a 19-9 lead with seven minutes to go in the half after a pair of Maten free throws. A tip-in at the halftime horn by Claxton put Georgia up 42-23. Claxton\u2019s father, Charles Claxton, scored 1,274 points for the Bulldogs. Nicholas Claxton said he is learning the college game. \u201cThe biggest challenge has been knowing where I have to be on defense and offense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been mental. I don\u2019t feel lost.\u201d Temple shot 31 percent from the field and 43 percent from the free-throw line in the first half, while the Bulldogs shot 52 percent and 83, respectively. Georgia had a 25-11 rebounding advantage at the half, while Maten had 15 points and seven rebounds. Back-to-back jump hooks by Derek Ogbeide and Maten gave the Bulldogs a 46-23 in the opening minute of the second half. But the Bulldogs went nearly seven minutes without a field goal while Temple closed the gap to 54-40 as Enechionyia heated up from beyond the arc. He hit 7-of-9 3-pointers for the game. Jackson ended the drought for Georgia with a 3-pointer, followed by a short jumper, stretching Georgia\u2019s lead to 62-43 with 9:11 remaining. Three Owls fouled out \u2014 Josh Brown, De\u2019Vondre Perry and Ernest Aflakpui \u2014 as they pressured the Bulldogs. Georgia shot 39 free throws, hitting 28.

Everyone has bought into what we have to do to win. Everyone trusts each other on the team.\u201d TEST TIME Georgia Coach Mark Fox speculated that Temple was weary from final exams. \u201cThey tried to do what we did last week, which is come back after exams.

The couple announced the move in a letter addressed to their baby. (Reuters)  In 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates announced that they would commit 95 percent of their wealth to charitable work. Together with Warren Buffett, they also created the Giving Pledge, which asks the richest people in the world to devote half or more of their fortunes to philanthropy. One of the earliest people to sign the pledge? Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan. So it was not a complete surprise when Zuckerberg and Chan announced on Tuesday their plan to set aside 99 percent of their Facebook shares \u2014 \u201cabout $45 billion\u201d \u2014 for charity.  The news is this: Taking a page from the Gates family, they will use the money to pump up their nonprofit, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The private foundation is an especially American style of charitable giving. Nonprofit groups in the United States play a disproportionately large role in public life, in part because American tax laws make it attractive for the rich to donate. Much of their wealth could otherwise be captured by capital gains and estate taxes. Private spending on social welfare in the United States is four times the average in advanced economies, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The wealthiest countries, like France and Germany, are far more likely to use government resources to promote social good, and far less likely to use private resources. This gap in national philosophies helps explain why the Giving Pledge has been popular with American billionaires, yet not quite as popular abroad. German shipping magnate Peter Kr\u00e4mer is one of the most vocal detractors of the pledge, and the American tradition of government-sponsored charity. Here's an excerpt from a 2010 interview with the German paper Der Spiegel, which asked him for his reaction to the plan. Kr\u00e4mer: I find the US initiative highly problematic. You can write donations off in your taxes to a large degree in the USA. So the rich make a choice: Would I rather donate or pay taxes? The donors are taking the place of the state. That's unacceptable. SPIEGEL: But doesn't the money that is donated serve the common good? Kr\u00e4mer: It is all just a bad transfer of power from the state to billionaires. So it's not the state that determines what is good for the people, but rather the rich want to decide. That's a development that I find really bad. What legitimacy do these people have to decide where massive sums of money will flow? SPIEGEL: It is their money at the end of the day. Kr\u00e4mer: In this case, 40 superwealthy people want to decide what their money will be used for. That runs counter to the democratically legitimate state. In the end the billionaires are indulging in hobbies that might be in the common good, but are very personal. Compared to the richest nations, the United States ranks near the bottom in terms of public spending on social support, according to the OECD. But that\u2019s because a large chunk of the work is carried out by nonprofit organizations, or otherwise subsidized by the government through tax breaks.  On average in well-off countries, private social spending accounts for 2.6 percent of the gross domestic product. In the United States, private social spending is 11 percent.", "Americans are some of the most charitable people in the world in part because there is a centuries-old tradition of private nonprofit groups helping people in lieu of the government. Even Alexis de Tocqueville observed the trend in the 1830s, writing: \u201cIn every case, at the head of any new undertaking where in France you would find the government, or in England some great lord, in the United States you are sure to find an association.\" There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with the American system of tax-subsidized charity, of course. As de Tocqueville argued, promoting charity has the benefit of improving social cohesion. He wrote that when the government taxes and gives to the poor, people feel slighted. When people voluntarily give to the poor, they feel better about themselves. The critique is that this system affords too much power to the rich, whose decisions may not align with what\u2019s best for society. This is not to say that the government is a paragon of efficacy either, but it risks a lot to depend on a handful of mega-billionaires to be prudent, effective philanthropists. The U.S. tax code \"ends up subsidizing the gifts of high-income taxpayers the most, lower-income renters the least, and middle-class homeowners in the middle,\u201d Duke University's Charles T. Clotfelter has written. \"One of the most significant consequences of this tax treatment of charitable giving is to give to the wealthiest taxpayers a disproportionate role in allocating public resources and influencing the direction that institutions will take.\" In his book \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century,\" economist Thomas Piketty proposed a wealth tax as one way to address rising inequality \u2014 and transfer wealth from individuals to the state. In the United States, estate and gift taxes achieve some of that function by prodding people to donate their wealth instead of bequeathing it to their children. (Economists like Piketty tend to regard those measures as too modest.) The debate is whether the money is better of in the hands of the government, or in service to private nonprofits. There's no denying the good intentions of the billionaire philanthropists, but it can be hard to know whether the decisions they make about how to use their money ultimately serve society in the best ways. Gates has already given away more than $30 billion, and Buffett has parted with $22 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock. In 2010, before the lion's share of those gifts, the Guardian described the impact of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on public health: Precise effects of big charity projects can be hard to measure, especially over a relatively short period. But already two bodies that the foundation funds heavily, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) and the Global Fund to Fight HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, have, according to the foundation, delivered vaccines to more than 250 million children in poor countries and prevented more than an estimated five million deaths. \"The foundation has brought a new vigour,\" says Michael Edwards, a veteran charity commentator and usually a critic of billionaire philanthropists. \"The charity sector can almost disempower itself; be too gloomy about things . . . Gates offers more of a positive story. He is a role model for other philanthropists, and he is the biggest.\" What genre of philanthropy will Chan and Zuckerberg invest in? Possibly anything. Their letter Tuesday set two missions, both ambitiously vague: \u201cadvancing human potential\u201d and \u201cpromoting equality.\" They mention curing diseases, improving clean energy, promoting entrepreneurship, fighting poverty and hunger, empowering women and minorities, and so on. The pair do not have a sterling track record when it comes to effective charity. One of their previous efforts, a high-profile $100 million donation to fix the schools in Newark, N.J., has been widely criticized as a failure. Chan and Zuckerberg write in their announcement that they have learned from their past experiences with philanthropy. For now, they will start with their own community in San Francisco, focusing on education, health and \u201cconnecting people.\u201d How to Adult A new video series from The Washington Post"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

The Huffington Post spoke with Zoltan about blessings, why talking about a children\u2019s book series like a sacred text isn\u2019t as crazy as it sounds, and whether aliens might confuse Harry Potter for a real religion. How much do you think J.K. Rowling legitimately thought about the themes you talk about on the podcast, and how much does that even matter? We took the position that it doesn\u2019t matter. I think that it\u2019s completely valid way to read a text, and sometimes I think it\u2019s a really interesting way to read a text. You know, that\u2019s the way that I\u2019ve read Phillip Roth novels \u2015 I think a lot more about his intentions, and the arguments he\u2019s trying to make, and the way that his arguments matured and evolved over the years that he wrote. And I think that there\u2019s a lot to be said for doing that with these books, with Rowling\u2019s. It\u2019s just not how we chose to do it here. We\u2019re trying to talk about the books the way that people talk about religious texts in religious settings. The way that you talk about the Bible in church, the way that you talk about the Torah in temple, the way that you talk about the Quran in mosques. And authorial intent is not the way that those things get discussed in those spaces. You know, you don\u2019t go to church, or you don\u2019t go to most churches, [to discuss authorial intent.] There are certainly some churches and certainly some temples and obviously some mosques in which we talk about historical, critical theory \u2015 you know, who were the people who sat around and actually transcribed these texts? \u2015 but most places of worship aren\u2019t like that. And we think it is to the benefit of our hearts and our spirits to not get tripped up by that. We\u2019ll never know what Rowling intended. If you do a Freudian interpretation of Rowling, Rowling will never know what she intended. So we don\u2019t want to get distracted by that. Do you think people naturally want to analyze any entertainment media they love to this extent and try to draw meaning from it? As such a powerful communication tool, the internet has certainly given fans a way to do that, and we\u2019ve seen so many fandoms crop up there. The way that we talk about it is: If you love something, and it\u2019s complicated enough, we encourage you to practice treating something as sacred. What you\u2019re doing is practicing loving something, and practicing loving things can only be a good thing. You get better at loving, and it\u2019s a time in which you\u2019re having a positive emotional experience. We just think that is always good. But I think that it depends on the intention. I think that if you\u2019re on \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d website, you can think that being absorbed by this is really interesting \u2015 [maybe] it\u2019s distracting from something really stressful in your life \u2015 but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s treating \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d as sacred. And I think that is fine. If you\u2019re on the website because you love the gossip, and no judgment in that, I just don\u2019t think that your heart is being fed by that exercise. I certainly do a lot of things in which my heart is not being fed! But I just think that if you pick these things with intention, and apply practice to it, a lot of things can end up being sacred texts. At the end of each episode, the two of you each pick a character from that chapter to bless. Why? We do it for two main reasons. One is that so much goodness is invisible in the world, and so we want to call out people\u2019s goodness that isn\u2019t entirely obvious. So you reread a positive quality on a character that we had negative associations with \u2015 seeing something positive in Aunt Petunia or Aunt Marge \u2015 or draw attention to secondary or tertiary characters, pointing out that just because somebody isn\u2019t a primary character in your life doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have an entire inner life. And we\u2019re trying to draw attention to that. But then the secondary purpose is that we\u2019re hoping, in some ways, that we\u2019re offering blessings to our listeners. So if we are blessing the fact that Hermione is a recreational reader, we\u2019re hoping that people who feel introverted and alone in their reading \u2015 and feel like that\u2019s something private about them \u2015 that they feel recognized in that blessing. We hope that people feel a sense of community and feel a lack of aloneness in hearing these blessings.  What is your take on the fundamentalists who tried to ban Harry Potter from school libraries in the early 2000s on religious grounds? First of all, I\u2019m just against banning books. So there\u2019s just that. But I also think that they haven\u2019t read the books. I went and gave a talk at Gordon-Conwell Seminary, which is one of the most conservative Christian seminaries on the East Coast, and I was talking about Harry Potter. And somebody said to me, \u201cWell, it makes sense that you\u2019re treating Harry Potter as a sacred text because it\u2019s such a Christian text.\u201d And I grew up atheist and Jewish so I was like, \u201cHow is it a Christian text?\u201d And the guy was like, \u201cWell, he literally dies and rises from the dead in order to save humanity.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, right.\u201d It certainly has very traditional Christian values like generosity and love and non-violence, and [based on] my understanding of Jesus from [divinity] school and my minister friends, I think Jesus would really dig the Harry Potter books. People ban things because they\u2019re afraid of them. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of hate involved \u2015 it\u2019s just fear. They were really popular. They were capturing kids\u2019 imaginations, and [people] want to control the narrative of what is capturing kids\u2019 imaginations. The irony of all of it is that the Church was playing the same role that the Ministry of Magic was. They\u2019re such loving, traditional-values-oriented texts that it\u2019s funny. So, 5,000 years from now, do you think archeologists or aliens might look at the rubble of our lost civilization and legitimately confuse Harry Potter for a religious text? Yes and no. I think the artifacts of Judaism and Christianity and Islam and Zoroastrianism or whatever \u2015 they have much more archeological history of, you know, buildings and churches that go back thousands of years. So it depends on the sophistication of their tools. But certainly we have Harry Potter World, which is a church, of sorts, and you only have one Bible on your shelf but you have seven Harry Potter books on your shelf.  Not to mention all the book parties and movies. Right! And costumes. Absolutely. The Harry Potter universe has a lot of things that look a lot like a religion. It has rituals. It has sayings. You say, \u201cmischief managed!\u201d Or, \u201cRaise a glass to the Boy who Lived!\u201d You have certain arguments; there are these [conventions] where they do all sorts of rituals. I haven\u2019t been to a con yet but we\u2019re supposed to be going in the spring and I\u2019m really excited to see it. The midnight release parties are absolute rituals. There are movie-watching parties. There are all sorts of rituals associated with it. There\u2019s a central text associated with it. I mean, it has a lot of the requirements of being a religion.  I, at minimum, think it would confuse them. I also think football stadiums will confuse the aliens in 10,000 years.

Credit Alexander Seymour and Austin Allen", "The ocean is full of plastic. Eight million tons are dumped in the seas every year. Plastic bags have been found in the guts of dead sea turtles, which mistake them for jellyfish. More than 200 species have been documented eating plastic, which looks colorful and edible but can kill them. In lab experiments, even tiny corals, the organisms that make up reefs, have been observed nibbling on a confetti of broken down plastic fragments similar to what swirls through the depths. But they aren\u2019t just eating whatever floats by. Instead, according to a new study in Marine Pollution Bulletin, some of the chemicals infused in the plastic may actually taste like food to the corals. It isn\u2019t yet clear how much plastic is consumed by corals in the wild, or what harm it might do to these important marine organisms, which are already threatened by environmental dangers like warming seas and pollution. But understanding why plastic might appeal to them is important, especially because some particles appear to get stuck in the corals, potentially disrupting their digestive process. Hundreds of chemicals are mixed into plastics to achieve certain textures or other characteristics. Because the corals sense the presence of food with receptors, it would not be all that surprising if some chemical additives mimicked substances that set off the corals\u2019 appetites, suggested Alexander Seymour and Austin Allen, who were both graduate students at Duke University when they led this study. Advertisement In their experiment, the researchers offered corals collected from North Carolina\u2019s coastal waters two different kinds of plastic to see what would be more popular: plastic dipped in seawater and covered with a thin layer of bacteria, or weathered plastic without added bacteria. The corals seemed to prefer the bacteria-free plastic, ingesting more of it than the other shards. The difference between the consumption of the two plastics could come down to the concentrations of additive chemicals. Perhaps the microbes on the first set of plastic kept those added compounds from reaching the corals as swiftly. Or maybe the microbes produced substances that kept the corals from eating them as quickly. Daniel Rittschof, the pair\u2019s adviser, and other members of the lab are now working to verify whether specific substances in plastic are tasty to marine invertebrates. Finding out what these are and how they work could have far-reaching implications."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Temper That Giddy Feeling in Your Gut", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Advertisement While we have long known about the existence of microbes \u2014 the tiny bacteria, fungi and archaea that live all around, on and in us \u2014 our full relationship has become one of the hottest topics for research only in recent years. Scientists believe that every person contains as many independent microbial cells as human cells. This collection of life, known as the microbiome, provides useful functions for us. Indeed, some of the things we think our bodies do are actually the abilities and enzymes of life-forms living within us. They can help with digestion, vitamin synthesis and even immunological responses. But, as with many new breakthroughs and advances, the hype of the microbiome often outweighs the reality. This seems especially likely in the field of nutrition. Doing research on the microbiome is not easy, and there are many opportunities to foul things up. To accomplish human studies, large samples of people and microbiomes are needed to account for potential confounding variables. Specimens have to be collected and stored carefully because contamination has been a big problem. DNA has to be extracted, amplified and sequenced. Finally, powerful bioinformatics tools are necessary to assemble and analyze the huge amount of data contained in a sequence of nucleotides \u2014 all of which has resulted in a wide range of new \u201comics,\u201d including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics. Of course, if we think that microbes play a large role in health, we have to rethink the role that antimicrobials play in our lives. In this thinking, antibiotics and antifungals could be life-changing or life-threatening. But that\u2019s not the case. There are many reasons to avoid unnecessary use of these medications, but the microbiome appears able to withstand most treatment. Still, antimicrobials clearly have an effect on the microbiome. Many studies, along with common sense, suggest that when we treat people with antibiotics, we change the amount and type of microbes that live in our gut. We\u2019ve seen this with Clostridium difficile. C. diff, as it is also known, is a bacterium that lives in many healthy people. The presence of other microbes keeps its numbers in check. But when we treat people with antibiotics that kill off other bacteria, but not C. diff, it can increase its presence and lead to serious illness. Infection with C. diff is hard to treat, and it\u2019s not uncommon. In 2011 in the United States, there were more than 450,000 cases, causing 29,000 deaths. A number of studies have shown promise in using the microbiome to treat C. diff. Fecal transplant (which is exactly what it sounds like) effectively fixes a damaged microbiome by infusing it with a healthy one. This type of therapy could theoretically work in treating other diseases. But there\u2019s a huge gap between \u201cholds promise\u201d and \u201cdefinitive treatment.\u201d After all, there\u2019s a direct biological explanation for why the microbiome and antibiotics play a role in C. diff. That direct link is much harder to describe when talking about other disorders. Many have postulated that the microbiome has an important part to play in inflammatory bowel diseases, which, because of my condition, I follow quite closely. Others have attempted to link it to disorders of development and behavior, like autism. Because the microbiome takes root in childhood, studies have explored if pregnancy, method of delivery or even the environment might hold some meaning in the microbiome\u2019s development and later health. Even more significantly, many have begun to hypothesize that it has a significant role in the current obesity epidemic. Studies have shown that transferring the microbiome from a thin mouse to an obese one, or vice versa, could lead to a change in body size to match. It was this type of study that roused much of your ire when I dismissed it in my discussion of artificial sweeteners. Other studies show that changes in diet can change the microbiome in human beings. But when you analyze all these studies together, as scientists did in a meta-analysis last summer, the certainty of those links becomes much less certain. This doesn\u2019t mean that the microbiome doesn\u2019t play a role in nutrition. Some important research has begun to show that chronic malnutrition probably causes changes in the microbiome that make treating the problem much harder than many anticipate. Problems with substandard sanitation can also contribute to microbial changes in very poor environments, compounding the problems of malnutrition. But we haven\u2019t yet figured out how to translate these findings into easily used treatments. The problem with getting too enthusiastic about the microbiome isn\u2019t much different from the problem with getting too enthusiastic about any research advances. Many mistake correlation for causation; just because some people have a different microbiome doesn\u2019t mean that microbes are responsible for other differences. Studies in mice are not the same as studies of humans; diet is incredibly complex, and rarely do results in genetically similar animals easily translate to diverse groups of people. And the microbiome is very, very complicated. We understand so little about it, and the idea that we can make accurate representations about it, let alone manipulate it, is somewhat far-fetched. As with the genome before it, our greater understanding of the microbiome has spurred great excitement and interest. Last May, the White House began the National Microbiome Initiative, with huge public and private investment into research. We hope these investments will yield great returns, but it will be important to temper our enthusiasm with an appropriate amount of skepticism.

Eliason, who began work on the project as a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, explained that experts analyzed Caihong\u2019s melanosomes, the parts of cells that contain pigment. \u201cTo find the color of Caihong\u2019s feathers, we compared its melanosomes with a growing database of thousands of measurements of melanosomes found in modern birds,\u201d he said. Color is not only dictated by pigment, but by the structure of the melanosomes that contain the pigment. \u201cHummingbirds have bright, iridescent feathers, but if you took a hummingbird feather and smashed it into tiny pieces, you\u2019d only see black dust. The pigment in the feathers is black, but the shapes of the melanosomes that produce that pigment are what make the colors in hummingbird feathers that we see,\u201d said Eliason. The dinosaur is the earliest-known animal with asymmetrical feathers \u2013 a feature that modern birds use for steering in flight. Caihong, however, couldn\u2019t fly \u2013 its feathers were probably used to attract mates and keep warm. Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Science, who co-authored the study, notes that, unlike modern birds, who have asymmetrical feathers on their wingtips, Caihong\u2019s asymmetrical feathers were on its tail. \u201cThe tail feathers are asymmetrical but wing feathers not, a bizarre feature previously unknown among dinosaurs including birds,\u201d he said, in a statement. \u201cThis suggests that controlling [flight] might have been first evolved with tail feathers during some kind of aerial locomotion.\u201d The bony crest on Caihong\u2019s head is also noteworthy when combined with its feathered features. \u201cThis combination of traits is rather unusual,\u201d said study co-author Julia Clarke of the University of Texas at Austin, in the statement. \u201cIt has a velociraptor-type skull on the body of this very avian, fully feathered, fluffy kind of form.\u201d The international team that worked on the Caihong project was led by Dongyu Hu, a professor in the College of Paleontology at the Shenyang Normal University in China. Caihong is not the only dinosaur making headlines. In a separate announcement, paleontologists recently revealed the discovery of a new turkey-sized dino species in southeastern Australia.

Pollution in India has turned parts of its marble facade yellow and black. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times", "NEW DELHI \u2014 For the first time ever, the Taj Mahal, India\u2019s monument to eternal love, is getting a serious cleaning. For more than 350 years, monsoon rains in Agra, the bustling city where the monument sits, were enough to wash dirt off the structure\u2019s walls. But pollution has worsened over the last couple of decades, and parts of the marble facade have turned yellow and black. Since 2015, workers have scaled the monument\u2019s minarets and walls to correct discoloration and remove layers of grime from the 17th-century structure, which was built by the Muslim emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Behind the monument, the Yamuna River has also filled with sewage and other waste, worsening the problem by attracting millions of mosquito-like insects. They settle near the backside of the Taj Mahal and excrete a green substance on its walls during mating flights. Cleaning the monument is time-consuming and challenging. To remove discoloration, workers suspended on scaffolding are caking Fuller\u2019s earth \u2014 a mud paste that absorbs dirt, grease and animal excrement, and that is commonly used to treat skin impurities \u2014 on the entire monument. The mud is then washed off, leaving a pristine surface. \u201cNo chemicals are used,\u201d said Bhuvan Vikrama, a superintendent with the Archaeological Survey of India, which is overseeing the cleaning. \u201cThis is the best option, so far, that we have come across. We have been using it for decades on marble surfaces.\u201d Over the last few years, the scaffolding has mostly prevented people from taking unobstructed photographs of the monument. Workers have tried to clean the minarets in stages, in part to ensure that the millions of tourists who visit the Taj Mahal every year come away with a good view of the tomb, which Rabindranath Tagore, India\u2019s celebrated poet, once compared to \u201ca solitary tear suspended on the cheek of time.\u201d But this year, workers may face their biggest hurdle yet: restoring the monument\u2019s dome to a pearly white. The metal scaffolds that workers used to apply mud paste to the minarets are too heavy and rigid to assemble around the dome, so a type of bamboo scaffolding, which was used for conservation work in the 1940s, is being considered instead. Cleanup efforts have become a topic of conversation around Agra, where some people said that the extra scaffolding, which forms a black web around the marble, may deter visitors. Prominent politicians have shown up for the cleaning, including Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, the state that includes Agra. Mr. Adityanath, a Hindu nationalist, came under fire last year for questioning the centrality of the Taj Mahal, with its Muslim heritage, in India\u2019s tourism circuit. But on a recent visit, he, too, picked up a broom to sweep near an entry gate, calling the monument a \u201cunique gem.\u201d Investment has recently poured into Agra. In 2012, a fast-track highway connecting New Delhi, India\u2019s capital, with Agra opened, allowing visitors to reach the Taj Mahal in around three hours. In December, the World Bank announced that it would provide a $40 million loan to the Indian and Uttar Pradesh governments to develop the Taj Mahal and other monuments. It is unclear how much \u2014 if any \u2014 of that money will be spent on the cleaning, which officials are hoping to complete by November. Although tourism numbers at the Taj Mahal have dropped slightly over the last few years, perhaps because of the scaffolding, the crowds are still enormous, prompting the Archaeological Survey of India to float a proposal to cap the number of daily visitors at 40,000 people and limit entry to three hours for each tourist. Fodor\u2019s Travel Guide has advised visitors to skip the Taj Mahal until restoration work on the dome, which has yet to start, is completed. But Shamsuddin Khan, a longtime tour guide in Agra, said he was unconcerned. He expressed confidence that people from all over the world would continue to wake up before dawn, just as they have for years, to catch a glimpse of the tomb blanketed in soft, golden light. \u201cThe Taj Mahal is going to remain the Taj Mahal,\u201d he said."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Credit Pool photo by Awad Awad", "This article was reported by Helene Cooper, Mark Mazzetti and Jim Rutenberg, and written by Ms. Cooper. WASHINGTON, July 26 \u2014 During a high-level meeting in Riyadh in January, Saudi officials confronted a top American envoy with documents that seemed to suggest that Iraq\u2019s prime minister could not be trusted. One purported to be an early alert from the prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, to the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr warning him to lie low during the coming American troop increase, which was aimed in part at Mr. Sadr\u2019s militia. Another document purported to offer proof that Mr. Maliki was an agent of Iran. The American envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, immediately protested to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, contending that the documents were forged. But, said administration officials who provided an account of the exchange, the Saudis remained skeptical, adding to the deep rift between America\u2019s most powerful Sunni Arab ally, Saudi Arabia, and its Shiite-run neighbor, Iraq. Now, Bush administration officials are voicing increasing anger at what they say has been Saudi Arabia\u2019s counterproductive role in the Iraq war. They say that beyond regarding Mr. Maliki as an Iranian agent, the Saudis have offered financial support to Sunni groups in Iraq. Of an estimated 60 to 80 foreign fighters who enter Iraq each month, American military and intelligence officials say that nearly half are coming from Saudi Arabia and that the Saudis have not done enough to stem the flow. One senior administration official says he has seen evidence that Saudi Arabia is providing financial support to opponents of Mr. Maliki. He declined to say whether that support was going to Sunni insurgents because, he said, \u201cThat would get into disagreements over who is an insurgent and who is not.\u201d Senior Bush administration officials said the American concerns would be raised next week when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates make a rare joint visit to Jidda, Saudi Arabia. Officials in Washington have long resisted blaming Saudi Arabia for the chaos and sectarian strife in Iraq, choosing instead to pin blame on Iran and Syria. Even now, military officials rarely talk publicly about the role of Saudi fighters among the insurgents in Iraq. The accounts of American concerns came from interviews with several senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they believed that openly criticizing Saudi Arabia would further alienate the Saudi royal family at a time when the United States is still trying to enlist Saudi support for Mr. Maliki and the Iraqi government, and for other American foreign policy goals in the Middle East, including an Arab-Israeli peace plan. In agreeing to interviews in advance of the joint trip to Saudi Arabia, the officials were nevertheless clearly intent on sending a pointed signal to a top American ally. They expressed deep frustration that more private American appeals to the Saudis had failed to produce a change in course. The American officials said they had no doubt that the documents shown to Mr. Khalilzad were forgeries, though the Saudis said they had obtained them from sources in Iraq. \u201cMaliki wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to put that on a piece of paper,\u201d one senior Bush administration official said. He said Mr. Maliki later assured American officials that the documents were forgeries. The Bush administration\u2019s frustration with the Saudi government has increased in recent months because it appears that Saudi Arabia has stepped up efforts to undermine the Maliki government and to pursue a different course in Iraq from what the administration has charted. Saudi Arabia has also stymied a number of other American foreign policy initiatives, including a hoped-for Saudi embrace of Israel. Of course, the Saudi government has hardly masked its intention to prop up Sunni groups in Iraq and has for the past two years explicitly told senior Bush administration officials of the need to counterbalance the influence Iran has there. Last fall, King Abdullah warned Vice President Dick Cheney that Saudi Arabia might provide financial backing to Iraqi Sunnis in any war against Iraq\u2019s Shiites if the United States pulled its troops out of Iraq, American and Arab diplomats said. Several officials interviewed for this article said they believed that Saudi Arabia\u2019s direct support to Sunni tribesmen increased this year as the Saudis lost faith in the Maliki government and felt they must bolster Sunni groups in the eventuality of a widespread civil war. Saudi Arabia months ago made a pitch to enlist other Persian Gulf countries to take a direct role in supporting Sunni tribal groups in Iraq, said one former American ambassador with close ties to officials in the Middle East. The former ambassador, Edward W. Gnehm, who has served in Kuwait and Jordan, said that during a recent trip to the region he was told that Saudi Arabia had pressed other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 which includes Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman \u2014 to give financial support to Sunnis in Iraq. The Saudis made this effort last December, Mr. Gnehm said. The closest the administration has come to public criticism was an Op-Ed page article about Iraq in The New York Times last week by Mr. Khalilzad, now the United States ambassador to the United Nations. \u201cSeveral of Iraq\u2019s neighbors \u2014 not only Syria and Iran but also some friends of the United States \u2014 are pursuing destabilizing policies,\u201d Mr. Khalilzad wrote. Administration officials said Mr. Khalilzad was referring specifically to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Ms. Rice and Mr. Gates, as well as Mr. Cheney and Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, have in recent months pressed their Arab counterparts to do more to encourage Iraq\u2019s Sunni leaders to support Mr. Maliki, senior administration officials said. \u201cThis message certainly has been made very clear in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cBut there is a deep reserve directed both at the person of the Maliki government but more broadly at the concept\u201d that Iraq\u2019s Shiites are \u201csurrogates of Iran.\u201d Saudi Arabia has grown increasingly concerned about the rising influence of Iran in the region. A spokesman at the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not return telephone calls on Thursday. But one adviser to the royal family said that Saudi officials were aware of the American accusations. \u201cAs you know by now, we in Saudi Arabia have been active in having a united Arab front to, first, avoid further inter-Arab conflict, and at the same time building consensus to move toward a peace settlement between the Arabs and Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cHow others judge our motives is their problem.\u201d Even as American frustration at Saudi Arabia grows, American military officials are still cautious about publicly detailing the extent of the flow of foreign fighters going to Iraq from Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month, for instance, Brig. Gen. Kevin Bergner, the top American military spokesman in Iraq, detailed the odyssey of a foreign fighter recently captured in Ramadi. In his public account, General Bergner told reporters that the man had arrived in Syria on a chartered bus, was smuggled into Iraq by a Syrian facilitator, and was given instructions to carry out a suicide truck bombing on a bridge in Ramadi. He did not identify the man\u2019s nationality, but American officials in Iraq say he was a Saudi. The American officials in Iraq also say that the majority of suicide bombers in Iraq are from Saudi Arabia and that about 40 percent of all foreign fighters are Saudi. Officials said that while most of the foreign fighters came to Iraq to become suicide bombers, others arrived as bomb makers, snipers, logisticians and financiers. American military and intelligence officials have been critical of Saudi efforts to stanch the flow of fighters into Iraq, although they stress that the Saudi government does not endorse the idea of fighters from Saudi Arabia going to Iraq. On the contrary, they said, Saudi Arabia is concerned that these young men could acquire insurgency training in Iraq and then return home to carry out attacks in Saudi Arabia \u2014 similar to the Saudis who turned against their homeland after fighting in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The Bush administration\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia has deteriorated steadily since the United States invasion of Iraq, culminating in April when, bitingly, King Abdullah, during a speech before Arab heads of state in Riyadh, condemned the American invasion of Iraq as \u201can illegal foreign occupation.\u201d A month before that, King Abdullah effectively torpedoed a high-profile meeting between Israelis and Palestinians, planned by Ms. Rice, by brokering a power-sharing agreement between the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and the militant Islamist group Hamas that did not require Hamas to recognize Israel. While that agreement eventually fell apart, the Bush administration, on both occasions, was caught off guard and became infuriated. But Saudi officials have not been too happy with President Bush, either, and the plummeting of America\u2019s image in the Muslim world has led King Abdullah to strive to set a more independent course. The administration \u201cthinks the Saudis are no longer behaving the role of the good vassal,\u201d said Steve Clemons, senior fellow and director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation. The Saudis, in turn, \u201csee weakness, they see a void, and they\u2019re going to fill the void and call their own shots.\u201d Richard A. Oppel Jr. contributed reporting from Baghdad.

The explanation from Casey was simple: \"We're building for something bigger.\" Valanciunas had 16 points and 13 rebounds, and the rested Raptors used strong 3-point shooting to beat the Atlanta Hawks 108-93 on Wednesday night. Playing in their first game since Saturday's loss at Minnesota, Toronto made 14 3-pointers, including eight in the first half. The Raptors improved to 25-6 when making at least 10 3s this season. Toronto's big lead was 32 points, but Atlanta's reserves, led by rookie John Collins' 13 points and career-high 16 rebounds, had the stronger finish to the game. \"It was a letdown at the end,\" Casey said. \"I was disappointed at the way that last group went in. It's a game of habits and that's what I just told the young guys. ... You create bad habits and it shows up in weird places.\" Casey wants his players to win home-court advantage throughout the conference playoffs. The Raptors entered the game 1 \u00bd games behind Boston in the race for the No. 1 seed in the East. Fred VanVleet added 19 points off the bench and All-Star starter DeMar DeRozan had 14 as Toronto moved to 3-0 against Atlanta this season. The Raptors won the first two games of the season series by an average of 23.5 points. \"It feels like this year they've played really, really well against us,\" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \"I think you have to give them credit whey we have not played well.\" Dennis Schroder led Atlanta with 20 points. Kent Bazemore had 13 points. The Raptors had good reason to feel comfortable. They arrived in Atlanta on Sunday and in a rarity had time to focus on fundamentals in two practices. \"We tried to focus on getting back to the basics,\" said Jakob Poeltl, who had six points. \"... I think it showed tonight.\" Toronto had 12 blocks and 10 steals. Before the game, Casey wasn't sure what to expect following the unusually long rest. \"It's an unknown,\" Casey said. \"Hopefully it's good, the break is good, but sometimes rust is something else, too, when you get out of game rhythm.\" The Raptors showed no rust. They were never threatened after stretching their lead to 17-6 with an 11-0 run, capped by Serge Ibaka's 3-pointer, in the first quarter. TIP-INS Raptors: Valanciunas reached double-double status with his rebound and jam midway through the third period. ... VanVleet finished three points shy of his career high of 22 points against Cleveland on Jan. 11. ... The Raptors coasted despite their two All-Stars, DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, combining to make only 7 of 22 shots. Lowry had nine points while making 3 of 10 shots. Hawks: F DeAndre Bembry is expected to miss another one to three weeks after an MRI revealed a left adductor strain. He suffered the groin strain on Jan. 5 ... Schroder matched his career high with eight rebounds. NO HARM Following a video review, officials ruled no flagrant foul after Schroder had contact with Lowry in the third quarter, knocking Lowry to the floor. ROOKIE HONOR Collins will represent the U.S. team in the Rising Stars game as part of All-Star weekend on Feb. 9 in Los Angeles. Collins is averaging 10.6 points and 6.9 rebounds and has made 59 percent of his shots from the field. Collins called the honor \"truly a blessing. This is something I've been working for all year. ... It will be fun.\" FREE SANDWICH The biggest cheer of the night from the home fans came in the final minute. The Hawks offered every fan a free Chick-fil-A sandwich if a visiting player missed two straight free throws. With 34.9 seconds remaining, cheers began when Lucas Nogueira hit the rim on his first free throw. He drew iron again on his second miss, earning an unexpected ovation.

(Mira Oberman/AFP/Getty Images)  The Trump administration on Monday unveiled its goals for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, issuing a broad plan for how it hopes to rewrite the terms of trade and transform the U.S. economy for decades to come. The document contained a broad list of objectives, including some goals that have been specifically championed by President Trump, as well as numerous provisions that echo the Trans Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era trade agreement that Trump has disparaged. \"You can say everybody\u2019s objectives are in here,\" said Doreen Edelman, co-chair of the global business team at the law firm Baker Donelson. \"I think the people that wrote the objectives wrote them in a way that will allow everybody to find a win.\" More than a third of U.S. exports flow to Canada and Mexico, and business and labor groups were watching closely to see what Trump's team would prioritize in the negotiations. Companies that export products to Canada and Mexico are wary of anything that could limit their future access to those markets. Firms that have struggled against foreign competition, as well as labor groups that have seen their members' wages undercut by foreign workers, were hoping for measures that would give them a leg up. The list, as well as the diverse and at times competing groups watching it, highlight the challenge Trump faces in transforming his criticism of the current trade deal into concrete policy proposals that live up to his promises. In a 17-page document, the trade agency outlined a plan to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico, restrict the amount of imported material in goods that qualify under the agreement, and eliminate a controversial mechanism to review trade remedies. The document's first provision contained the clear stamp of the Trump White House, as it called for the United States to reduce its trade deficit with NAFTA countries. Trump has often seized on bilateral deficits, which occur when the United States imports more from a trading partner than it exports to it, as a sign of a broken trading system -- despite criticism from economists who say the measure can be misleading.", "But trade negotiators and lawyers said that many of the provisions. \u2013 including measures to regulate treatment of workers, the environment and state-owned enterprises \u2013 appeared to be lifted from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that Trump heavily opposed. The document called for new rules to govern the trade of services, like telecommunications and financial advice, as well as digital goods like music and e-books, which were not included in the original 1994 agreement. It also called for creating an \"appropriate mechanism\" to ensure that the countries did not manipulate their currency to gain an unfair competitive advantage, a practice that China has used in past years to subsidize its exporters. The notice called for eliminating the Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism, which allows companies to appeal decisions by domestic courts on trade remedies in an alternative panel. The U.S. lumber industry and others have railed against the mechanism, arguing that it prevents the U.S. from fully enforcing its trade laws. Democrats were critical of Trump's objectives, saying they didn't go far enough. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) criticized the document as \"hopelessly vague,\" and said that provisions on topics including the environment looked like \"watered down versions of TPP proposals.\" \"It is surprising that in key areas the Trump Administration is seeking outcomes that were achieved in the TPP, which the President said was a bad agreement,\" he said in a statement. Republicans were more positive about the statement, though some still had criticisms. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tx.) said the objective set \"an ambitious standard for improving NAFTA\" that would allow the United States to use the deal \"as a model for future trade agreements, which means that the United States would be setting global rules \u2013 not our competitors.\" Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) welcomed the objectives as \"an important part of the public discussion about the launch of the upcoming trade talks among our three nations,\" but said that future objectives must include stronger protections for intellectual property rights. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland pointed out that Canada is America\u2019s top customer and that NAFTA supports millions of middle class jobs in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. \"When negotiations begin, we will be ready to work with our partners to modernize NAFTA, while defending Canada's national interest and standing up for our values,\" she said in a statement. The measured, comprehensive statement is a shift in tone from Trump's campaign rhetoric regarding NAFTA. He used the pact as a frequent foil, calling it \"a defective agreement\" and \"the worst trade deal maybe ever.\" Trump has often threatened to withdraw from NAFTA \u2014 including during a few tense days in April when the administration nearly scrapped the agreement, only to reverse its decision after pleas from U.S. businesses and foreign allies. At times, it has been unclear whether Trump's rhetoric represented a true policy stance or merely an attempt at leveraging further concessions from Canada and Mexico. Current trade law requires the administration to publish \u201ca detailed and comprehensive summary of the specific objectives\u201d at least 30 days before the United States begins talks with Canada and Mexico. The administration has said that negotiations could begin as soon as Aug. 16. Matt Gold, a professor at Fordham University and a former trade negotiator, said the administration did not shy away from including some of the most controversial trade issues among the trading partners. That included its calls to scrap the Chapter 19 dispute-settlement mechanism and eliminate certain barriers to U.S. agricultural exports \u2014 a reference to a long-standing conflict with Canada over dairy, poultry and eggs. A bipartisan deal negotiated by President George H.W. Bush and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, NAFTA went into force in January 1994. Over the course of years, it eliminated tariffs on most products traded among the three countries, including agricultural goods, automobiles and textiles. The deal was designed to knit the three economies of North America closer together, raising Mexico\u2019s standard of living and create a valuable new export market for U.S. and Canadian businesses. Critics at the time argued that the difference between U.S. and Mexican wages would send millions of American jobs over the southern border \u2014 what presidential candidate Ross Perot memorably warned of as a \"giant sucking sound.\" The deal still has plenty of critics, who accuse NAFTA of hollowing the U.S. manufacturing sector, especially in sectors such as automobiles. But U.S. farmers, retail chains and other industries consider the deal to be integral to their supply chains and have urged the administration to first \u201cdo no harm\u201d in its negotiations. Economists generally take a more nuanced view of the pact, believing that it has broadly benefited the U.S. economy by increasing trade and lowering the cost of consumer goods, while hurting narrow groups of workers who saw their jobs relocated across the border. In a 2012 survey of 41 prominent economists by the University of Chicago, 85 percent agreed that Americans were better off under NAFTA than under previous trade rules. Only 5 percent said they were uncertain, and none disagreed. Research by economists Shushanik Hakobyan and John McLaren found that NAFTA did lower wage growth for blue-collar workers in the most-affected industries during the 1990s. Overall, it concluded that the impact of NAFTA on American wages was small. A study by economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson found no discernible impact on U.S. wages from trade with Mexico and Central America. \u201cThere is almost no evidence that NAFTA was substantially harmful for U.S. workers. That myth has been promulgated by people from Ross Perot to Pat Buchanan to Donald Trump, but there is not any academic support for it,\u201d said Autor, an economist at MIT. His work has shown that China\u2019s entree into the international trading system in 2001 had a far bigger impact on U.S. workers. Yet NAFTA has clearly knit the economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico together, and economists say fracturing those connections could prove to be painful. Under the deal, regional trade has tripled to more than $1.1 trillion in 2016. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that 14 million American jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico. https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/nafta-negotiation-farmers/ Trump\u2019s opposition to NAFTA dates to the origin of the agreement. He criticized the deal in 1993, saying it would benefit only Mexico, according to local news reports at the time. Trump was similarly opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-country trade deal that included Canada and Mexico. The deal would have replaced some of NAFTA\u2019s provisions and was widely viewed as a NAFTA 2.0 for the North American trading bloc. Though the deal was considered dead because of opposition in Congress, Trump declared his opposition by officially withdrawing the United States from the deal on his first Monday in office. In his criticism of trade deals, Trump has formed an unusual alliance with labor-friendly figures on the political left, often sounding more similar to senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka than Republicans who have traditionally supported free trade. Other key figures in the NAFTA renegotiation are believed to be a more moderating stance to Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric. Lighthizer, the administration\u2019s main trade negotiator, has a reputation for taking tough action to protect American trade interests under the Reagan administration. Yet in testimony to Congress, he assured lawmakers that he would seek to first do no harm to an agreement that he acknowledged as important for American farmers and industries. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary who Trump has entrusted with much of his trade agenda, has been even more moderate. A past supporter of the TPP, Ross said in May that certain concessions Mexico and Canada made in the TPP negotiations should be viewed as a \u201cstarting point\u201d for NAFTA. \u201cThere are some concessions that the NAFTA partners made in connection with the proposed TPP,\u201d Ross said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cThere is no reason to throw those away.\u201d In a conference call with press Monday morning, Democratic lawmakers and labor leaders said this approach would fall short of Trump's promises to blue-collar workers. \u201cNAFTA needs to be fundamentally rewritten, not merely tweaked, and working people are united in our demand to rewrite NAFTA,\u201d Trumka said. \u201cIf the group in Washington refuses to get the job done, American workers will find leaders who will.\u201d The Trump administration is renegotiating NAFTA under a legal provision called fast-track authority, which gives the president wide authority to independently broker a trade agreement before submitting it to Congress for an up-or-down vote. The statute requires the administration to publish detailed objectives for the negotiations at least 30 days before its formal talks begin.

Bannon is set to interview with Mueller by the end of the month, these people say, as the special counsel's investigation moves closer to President Donald Trump's inner circle. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was a witness to the firing of Comey, was interviewed last week, the Justice Department confirmed Tuesday.  In addition to the Comey and Flynn firings, key issues from Bannon's time in the White House are likely to include Trump's decision to fire then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates and any pressure the President may have exerted on Sessions about the FBI investigation into Russia's interference with the election.", "Bannon's attorney has said that his client will not be able to use the protections of executive privilege to dodge questions when he meets with Mueller's team. Last week, Bannon infuriated lawmakers from both parties after he refused to answer questions before the House Intelligence Committee about his work during the presidential transition or in the West Wing. From his early days in the administration, Bannon was wary about the Russia investigation seeping into operations in the West Wing. He had only been working as chief strategist for a few months when he began trying to avoid meetings and discussions that could one day wind up of interest to investigators in the various Russia probes, according to sources familiar with the situation. Read More But his efforts to shield himself fell short. Bannon was a key force in lobbying Trump to bring on attorney Marc Kasowitz and spokesman Mark Corallo as his first legal team that wrangled with Russia issues, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. But it took months for the administration to stand up its current structure of lawyers, both inside and outside the White House, to handle the daily deluge of Russia revelations.", "In the meantime, Bannon and other top administration officials -- including former chief of staff Reince Priebus and current White House counsel Don McGahn -- sometimes found themselves racing from the West Wing to the residence to huddle with the President about emerging developments in the Russia investigation.  While Bannon may not have played a pivotal role in some of the key decisions that are raising alarms with investigators, even his knowledge of the President's mindset at the time could come into play. Bannon was largely cut out of the President's decision to fire Comey, a key element of Mueller's obstruction of justice investigation. Since leaving the White House, Bannon has publicly slammed the move, referring to it as the biggest mistake in modern political history in a September 2017 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" But Bannon could still provide insight into internal White House deliberations and Trump's state of mind as critical events like this unfolded. Even before his tenure in the White House, Bannon had been privy to a number of meetings and decisions that could be of interest to the special counsel and congressional investigators. 'Fire and Fury' revelations The former Breitbart News executive's propensity for spouting off in colorful fashion appears to have raised investigators' interest in Bannon. Mueller's team could use Michael Wolff's book \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\" as a blueprint for their Bannon interview, in addition to whatever evidence the team has already gathered. \"They will look for prior writings as well as statements by the witness, and they will be analyzed to determine whether they provide a basis for any line of questioning,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN contributor and a former prosecutor who was a special assistant to Mueller. \"It wouldn't surprise me if Mueller's team went through Michael Wolff's book and pulled out what they might want to ask about.\" In the book, Bannon said Trump \"kept trying\" to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin after the Kremlin strongman rebuffed Trump during his trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in December 2013.", "Bannon also claimed that Mueller's investigation is sure to lead back to money laundering. \"You realize where this is going. ... This is all about money laundering. Mueller chose (senior prosecutor Andrew) Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy,\" Bannon is quoted as saying in Wolff's book. \"Their path to f***ing Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr., and Jared Kushner. ... It's as plain as a hair on your face.\" Bannon also said Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, both senior White House advisers, are \"terrified\" that Mueller will investigate the finances of their respective business empires. It's not important what Bannon thinks, Zeldin explained. What matters is whether Bannon can provide investigators with verifiable facts to support his claims. That's what Mueller will be looking for.  Trump Tower meeting with the Russians Investigators are likely to press Bannon over the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr., Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.", "Bannon is quoted disparaging Trump's son Trump Jr. and Kushner in \"Fire and Fury,\" calling that meeting promising dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \"treasonous.\" Bannon has backtracked from that allegation and, after his House Intelligence Committee interview last week, sources told CNN that Bannon had acknowledged that the quote was \"hyperbole.\" Bannon also claimed in the Wolff book that there was \"zero\" chance that Trump Jr. didn't introduce the Russians to his father, an allegation Trump Jr. and others have denied.  The misleading Trump Tower statement Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee that he had had conversations about the Trump Jr. meeting with the Russians with Priebus, Corallo and Sean Spicer, who was White House press secretary at the time, according to a report in Axios.  \"Bannon immediately realized he'd slipped up and disclosed conversations he wasn't supposed to discuss, because they happened while he was chief strategist in the White House,\" the Axios report said. \"The meeting -- and the subsequent drafting of a misleading statement on Air Force One -- has become one of the most important focal points of the Russia investigations, both on Capitol Hill and within Mueller's team, because it provides one of the clearest indications that the Trump campaign was willing to entertain collusion with Russians,\" the report said. Michael Flynn's calls to the Russian ambassador  Mueller's investigators may also have questions about Bannon's activities during the presidential transition, a period that lawmakers on Capitol Hill were interested in when Bannon made his first appearance before the House Intelligence Committee.", "For instance, Bannon was forwarded an email during the transition detailing the plan for then-incoming national security adviser Flynn to talk with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions, according to The New York Times. The email is an important part of the investigation because it shows that Trump transition officials knew that Flynn would be discussing sanctions, despite later denials from Vice President Mike Pence and others. Affiliation with Cambridge Analytica  One of the other lingering questions in the Russia investigation is whether there was any collusion or cooperation between the Trump campaign's data team and the Russian government, which also used social media to target specific voters during the campaign. Both sides flatly deny any collusion. But Bannon is close to the Mercer family of GOP megadonors. They were major backers to Trump's campaign and support a variety of conservative groups, including Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked on the Trump campaign. Bannon served on the company's board before joining Trump's campaign.", "Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who contacted WikiLeaks in June 2016 to ask about Clinton's emails, testified before the House Intelligence Committee in December. And Mueller asked for the company's emails last fall, according to the Wall Street Journal. Just three months after Nix contacted Wikileaks, it exchanged private messages on Twitter with Trump Jr. In most of the messages from late September 2016, which Trump Jr. later released to the public, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share its materials on social media. Trump Jr. sent an email about the conversation to Bannon and a group of other senior Trump campaign officials, according to The Atlantic, and Mueller could press for additional information on those exchanges. Erik Prince's secret Russia meeting During the presidential transition, Bannon also attended one meeting that potentially triggered a series of events -- stretching all the way to a tiny island chain in the Indian Ocean -- which congressional investigators are scrutinizing. In December 2016, Bannon joined Kushner and Flynn for a meeting at Trump Tower with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. After the meeting, Erik Prince -- a businessman, Trump donor and Bannon ally -- reached out to the prince and said he had authorization to act as an informal emissary for Trump, according to The Washington Post.", "Prince, founder of the private security company Blackwater USA and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, flew to the Seychelles one month later and met Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, according to Prince's testimony at the House Intelligence Committee. Prince and the White House both deny that the Trump transition had anything to do with the planning of the meeting.

Far from it \u2013 he\u2019s putting himself forward as the man to unite all the different leave campaigns. Theresa who?                         Ukip leader, for now, Henry Bolton. Photograph: PA", "One by one, the resignations had come. People no one had ever heard of, quitting jobs that no one knew existed. By mid-afternoon, more than half the Ukip frontbench team had done a bunk in protest at Henry Bolton\u2019s continued leadership of the party. At least, that was a best guess figure; it was hard to keep an exact tally of who had gone and when, since a few members had to reannounce their resignations as no one had noticed when they had done so the first time around last week. All the while, Bolton remained holed up in a Folkestone hotel room. Just around the corner from his apartment. No one was going to take him alive. Bolton was genuinely perplexed. His only crime had been to fall in love with a woman half his age with racist views, who had happened to join a party that attracted racists of which he was leader. What could possibly be more normal than that? Now, if he had copped off with someone in her 50s who supported immigration and was pro-EU, that would have been a story. People were just jealous of his pulling power. The Ukip leader paced his room, counting down the minutes until his 4pm press conference at the back entrance of the hotel. He\u2019d left it that late in the day because he had wanted to catch the opening rounds of the World Indoor Bowls Championships on BBC2. Unmissable. It was just sheer bad luck that one match had been such a nailbiter that he\u2019d absent-mindedly wandered out the front of the hotel by mistake. By which time, the Ukip press office had already released a statement saying he\u2019d be staying on as leader. Undaunted \u2013 largely because he had no idea the news was already out \u2013 Bolton fought his way past the dustbins and headed down the potholed drive towards where the press were assembled. \u201cYesterday, the Ukip national executive committee ... \u201d he began. \u201cExcuse me, Mr Bolton,\u201d shouted one reporter. \u201cWe can\u2019t hear you. Would you mind stepping forward several paces to where the microphones are, please?\u201d What had started as Alan Partridge was rapidly turning into both Fawlty and Blackadder. As if suspecting a cunning plan, Bolton nervously inched his way towards the cameras and started reading out his statement for a second time. It wasn\u2019t him that was the problem, it was the party\u2019s NEC, he insisted. A bunch of small-minded prudes who were now suffering from buyers\u2019 regret at having chosen a leader with such powerful animal magnetism just a few months earlier. \u201cI respect the next steps in the constitutional process and will therefore not be resigning as party leader,\u201d he said. \u201cI repeat, I shall not be resigning as party leader.\u201d That repetition was as much for his own benefit as anyone else\u2019s. He sounded as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe what he was saying himself. Far from quitting, he was proposing to put himself forward as the man who could unite all the leave campaigns. Step aside, Theresa May. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Henry was putting himself forward as prime minister. The statement lasted just a few minutes, after which Bolton scuttled back indoors, muttering \u201cNo comment\u201d while being pursued by reporters who had been gifted unexpected gold dust. Some even wondered if Bolton hadn\u2019t been a fifth columnist all along who had set out to destroy Ukip from within. But that was to miss the point. This was a party hellbent on presenting its death throes as award-winning entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less. There was no great conspiracy. As so often in the past with Ukip, the whole thing had just been a bit of a cock-up. Only in Bolton\u2019s case, the cock-up had been literal.

The ongoing conversation about diversity in the film industry reached the Berlin International Film Festival on Thursday, after remarks made by the president of the festival's jury panel: Oscar-winner Meryl Streep. At a press conference for the festival, reporters asked the panel, Streep among them, about diversity on the jury and in the festival. In response to questions about diversity in the festival, Streep said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m very committed to equality and inclusion of people of all genders, races, ethnicities, religions; there should be inclusion and this jury is evidence that at least women are included \u2013 and in fact dominate \u2013 in this jury, and that\u2019s an unusual situation in bodies of people who make decisions, so I think that the Berlinale is ahead of the game.\u201d Later in the press conference, an Egyptian reporter asked Streep, \u201cThere is a film that is representing Tunisia and the Arab world and Africa in the main competition. How do you see this part of the world, and is it easy for you to understand that culture, and are you following any Arab movies?\u201d to which Streep responded at length. \u201cYes, in fact I\u2019ve just seen a film called Theeb, which I loved,\" she said. \"I saw Timbuktu recently, but I don\u2019t know very much about the Middle East, and yet I\u2019ve played a lot of different people from a lot of different cultures. The thing that I\u2019ve noticed is that there is a core of humanity that travels right through every culture. And, after all, we\u2019re all from Africa originally; we\u2019re all Berliners, we\u2019re all Africans, really. We have critic on our jury, we have a director on our jury, we have actors, a photographer, cinematographer; people will be looking at different things in these films, but we\u2019re human beings, and film is an emotional experience. We\u2019re going to make these decisions based on what our head wants to say, but we\u2019re first attacked in the heart.\u201d", "The Berlin Festival jury's other members are German actor Lars Eidinger, British film critic Nick James, French photographer Brigitte Lacombe, British actor Clive Owen, Italian actress Alba Rohrwacher and Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska. This is the first year that Streep has been serving as jury president. It opens Thursday with the Coen brothers comedy Hail, Caesar. It will run through Feb. 21, with 18 films in competition for its top prize. The diversity discussion in Berlin comes during the lead-up to the 2016 Academy Awards, which has sparked a conversation and outcry about diversity in film since, for the second year in a row, all 20 of the acting nominees announced in January were white. Director Spike Lee, actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith have declared their intention to boycott the Feb. 28 ceremony. As a result of the controversy, the Academy announced that it would implement sweeping changes in an attempt to diversify its membership, with the goal of doubling the number of women and people of color in its ranks by 2020.", "After the Academy Award nominations were announced and there were no people of color among the 20 acting nominees, a controversy and conversation has been brewing in Hollywood over diversity and representation in the industry. Stars have been speaking out on the issue, some saying they will boycott the Oscars. Will Smith said that he will join his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith by boycotting the Oscar ceremony. \"(Jada and I) have discussed it, and we're part of this community but at this current time, we're uncomfortable to stand there and say that this is okay. ... There's a regressive slide towards separatism, towards racial and religious disharmony and that's not the Hollywood that I want to leave behind. That's not the industry, that's not the America I want to leave behind.\" Getty Images for PSIFF  Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs announced on Friday Jan. 22 that the Academy was taking dramatic steps to diversify its membership, committing to doubling the number of women and people of color by 2020. \u201cThe Academy is going to lead and not wait for the industry to catch up,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThese new measures regarding governance and voting will have an immediate impact and begin the process of significantly changing our membership composition.\" Getty Images  'Selma' director Ava DuVernay has praised the Academy's steps, but hopes we can use a different word to discuss the issue than \"diversity.\" \u201cWe\u2019re hearing a lot about diversity.

Hebert/Invision/AP  Spike Lee said that he was not trying to start a boycott movement, only declaring his own intent not to attend the Oscars. He also said the problem goes beyond awards.\"It has to go back to the gatekeepers. The people who have the green light vote,\" he said, referring to those studio executives who decide which films get made. \"We\u2019re not in the room (with) the executives when they have these green light meetings quarterly where they look at the scripts, they look who\u2019s in it and they decide what we\u2019re making and what we\u2019re not making.\" Parrish Lewis  Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o, whose win in 2014 for '12 Years a Slave' marks the last time a black actor won an Oscar, expressed her disappointment in the nominations in an Instagram post. \"It has me thinking about unconscious prejudice and what merits prestige in our culture,\" she wrote. \"The awards should not dictate the terms of art in our modern society, but rather be a diverse reflection of the best of what our art has to offer today. I stand with my peers calling for change in expanding the stories that are told and recognition of the people who tell them.\" EPA  On 'The View' Whoopi Goldberg said she didn't support the boycott, but brought up the fact that this issue is widespread in Hollywood.\"Why is this a conversation that we only have once a year?\" she asked her co-hosts. \"Every year we get all fired up and the rest of the year nobody says anything. I make movies for a living. Let me tell you what the problem is \u2013 It's not that the people doing the nominating are too white ... The problem is the people who can be helping to make movies that have Blacks and Latinos and women and all that \u2013 that money doesn't come to you because the idea is that there is no place for Black movies.\" AP  'Furious 7' actor Tyrese Gibson has also spoken out on the issue. He called for Oscar host Chris Rock to step down from his duties. \"There is no joke that (Rock) can crack,\" Gibson said. \"There is no way for him to seize the moment and come into this thing and say, 'I'm going to say this and say that I'm going to address the issue but then I'm still going to keep my gig as the host.' The statement that you make is that you step down.\" Getty Images  George Clooney expressed his sympathy to the cause. \"I think that African Americans have a real fair point that the industry isn\u2019t representing them well enough,\" he said. \"I think that\u2019s absolutely true. ...

As an Academy member, I would love to see a more diverse voting membership.\" John Salangsang, Invision/AP  Oscar-winner Michael Caine said he thinks black actors need to be \"patient.\" \"There\u2019s loads of black actors. In the end you can't vote for an actor because he's black,\" he said. \"You can't say, 'I'm going to vote for him, he's not very good, but he's black, I'll vote for him.' ... Be patient.

She said Hollywood's lack of diversity stems from a fundamental lack of honesty.

PAUL, Minn. \u2014 A new report on child welfare that found more U.S. children living in poverty than before the Great Recession belies the fanfare of the nation's economic turnaround.   Twenty-two percent of American children were living in poverty in 2013 compared with 18 percent in 2008, according to the latest Kids Count Data Book, with poverty rates nearly double among African-Americans and American Indians and problems most severe in South and Southwest.   The report, released Tuesday from the child advocacy group the Annie E. Casey Foundation, showed some signs of slight improvement, including high school graduation rates at an all-time high and a dipping percentage of uninsured children. But the bright spots weren't enough to offset a picture that many children have been left behind amid the nation's economic recovery.   Here are some things to know about the report:   ___   DIFFERING CAUSES   The foundation's studies cover 16 different measures, delving into economic well-being, health care, education and family and community issues.   The problems extend beyond \u2014 and in some cases drive \u2014 increasing poverty rates. More children were raised in single-parent homes in 2013 than in 2008, and fewer lived with parents with secure employment.   Foundation President Patrick McCarthy said that particularly troubling is an increase in the share of kids living in poor communities, regardless of their own families' economic standing. The report says 1 in 7 children live in those areas, marked by poor schools and a lack of a safe place to play.   \"They're more likely to fall down the economic ladder, less likely to be employed and more likely to get in trouble,\" McCarthy said.   ___", "A MIX OF FIXES   McCarthy likened child poverty to a \"particularly pernicious form of cancer,\" and he prescribed a cocktail of economic policies and fixes to tackle it.   Tax credits and additional support such as food stamps could give low-income families a much-needed boost, and job training could provide help for struggling to get an economic foothold. Businesses should implement more family-friendly policies, and a massive infrastructure repair campaign could create countless jobs.   \"None of them is a magic bullet. When you put them all together, you start to put the children on a path to success,\" he said.   ___   STRUGGLING IN THE SOUTH   States in the South and Southwest continued a steady run at the bottom of the Kids Count rankings for overall child well-being, with issues including economic standing and education.   According to the report, 1 in 3 children from Mississippi live in poverty. Twelve percent of teens from Mississippi and Louisiana were neither in school nor working. Fifteen percent of Nevada children didn't have health insurance, compared with the nation-best 2 percent in Massachusetts.   ___   MIDWEST ON TOP   Minnesota nabbed the report's top ranking, taking a spot generally reserved for a Northeast state and rounding out the Midwest's strong pattern of supporting children.   McCarthy said there's not much to make of one state usurping another for a top spot. Instead, he focused on the broader regional patterns: New England and Midwestern states generally occupy the top 10 while the South and Southwest struggle in the bottom rankings.   \"That's where you see a difference in day-to-day lives,\" he said"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

The results then were less than stellar, I ended up falling asleep in my dorm room and missing my Italian midterm. Thankfully, this time, I did a little better. I started out with a 1.5 hour nap at 10:30pm and then it was off to Northampton, Massachusetts to meet up with my friend.", "'Sup and Pup' Our biggest hurdle was not the struggle to stay awake, but rather, one we were aware of beforehand: finding opportunities to shoot in a small town. Armed with this knowledge, I created a Google doc and tried to make a note of places that would be open, or have good light at various hours of the day. Aside from having a goal of successfully completing the project, I set a few other personal goals as well. The first was simple: to take better pictures than I had in years past.", "'Leading in the Poles' My other two goals related to the types of pictures I wanted to try and take. I have never successfully done a \"street portrait\"- One in which you ask a stranger for their picture. @365ken has been a role model for this kind of photo. The other style of shot is a bit harder to describe. It involves finding creative juxtapositions or situations and catching them on film. For this type of shot, I was most influenced by @powercorruptionandlikes.", "'Reader's Block' All in all, I was happy with how everything went. I pushed my photography a little further, didn't fall asleep on the job, and had a good time. Will I do it again next year? Well as my Italian professor taught me to say, \"vedremo\" (\"we shall see\"). At least I'm assuming that's what she taught me. I can't actually remember any Italian whatsoever. ..  giulia macario | melbourne, australia 24 hours of continuous photography with no sleep whatsoever, who would sign up for that? Ahem. me. Three times. What on earth was i thinking.... Like other years I left it up until the day of the event, and a few hours before, to really make up my mind on whether I was participating or not. That being said, I always seemed to get pulled in by the lure of taking part in such a fantastic worldwide event and being part of something bigger than myself. This year was no exception, and after being inspired by many talented photographer friends from all over the world in years passed, I again took part.", "'Ghosts of Piers Past' So why do it? I guess for me after nearly 8 months of not shooting anything, this was a way to kick my butt into photography gear again. They say practice, practice, practice... is the best way. And for me, not a 'seasoned' street shooter - it's definitely a challenge. I do not plan my shots or where i'll be hour by hour, I believe theres a magic to letting moments just happen, and if they dont, well, I just move on. I wasn't too concerned with fitting the mold of what was expected as a street shooter for my hourly posts, or sticking to a style, for me it was more about capturing a feeling using my way of seeing, whether it simply be a blur of colour, a fractured slow shutter experiment or a rush of red going by.", "'Sketches'", "'Rush by Red' The days before March 19 I had done a list of places and locations potentially interesting in my city, and done kinds of photographic rehearsals in different moments of the day to check what I would have found in terms of situations and light. And I had more or less planned the 24 Hours itinerary to optimize travelling time both by transports and on foot. I generally edit my images in black and white: interminable edits with frequent rethinks. To simplify this aspect I decided to shoot only with my iPhone 6s, using a default Hipsta bw combo (John S lens+ AO BW film+ Standard flash), limiting the manual edit just to a few steps.", "'Metaphysical Space' Although it was my first 24 hour project, I wasn't particularly anxious about the unavoidable tiredness due to sleep deprivation, but rather about the need to continuously focus on people as subjects. Most of my shots are usually taken in the street and people are always present as the main subject, but I'm not confident with candid portraits and didn't feel at ease with the idea of improvising a new style. So the most critical aspect to me was the idea to keep on documenting humanity in my own way. But after the first image of this photographic marathon, taken after some hesitation and a tension which was for me unusual, I felt it would be possible. And started to relax about the \"style\" issue.", "'The Common Reader ' The night was supposed to be the most difficult part of this marathon in terms of available subjects . That's why I had planned, hour by hour, an itinerary . But I didn't allow for the unexpected. Between 1 and 2 AM I had decided on a shot outside the emergency room of one of the major hospitals in town. I had imagined traffic due to ambulances and people going in and out. So you can imagine my total surprise when I didn't find at all what I was ready to take a shot of. One of the most quiet and sane nights in town. No ambulances, no people in need of a visit. Nothing. At last I took a shot of a biker who turned out to be a nocturnal worker at the hospital. A shot apparently taken in the middle of nowhere.", "'Night Shift' This wasn't the only unexpected situation I had to face during the marathon. For instance, I found no living soul in the 24 hour supermarket, and a military parade in the most famous square of the city, piazza Duomo, right where I had planned to shoot people idly sitting on the churchyard. There were no art watchers at the photo exhibition, and no street carts when I would have needed them. Many shots couldn't be posted because they were taken too early or too late. But I think this need for improvisation in a bunch of minutes, after so much planning, was the cool part of the story and what still makes me satisfied with my performance. A new chapter next year, no doubt about that.

(screen grab).  Churchgoing Midwestern folk don\u2019t normally land on the wrong end of a bitcoin murder contract, so the news about Amy Allwine was bizarre. It was May 2016. On the Dark Web, hackers had cracked into Besa Mafia, a website that claimed affiliation with Albanian organized crime and offered to arrange beatings and assassinations for a price. Emails between the site and potential clients, a treasure trove of illicit material, leaked across the Web \u2014 eventually landing at the FBI. As investigators sifted through the material, they zeroed in on an exchange between a user called \u201cdogdaygod,\u201d who they determined was trying to arrange the murder of a woman named Amy Allwine from a suburb outside St. Paul, Minn., according to court records recorded by Fox 9.  She \u201ctore my family apart by sleeping with my husband, and is stealing clients from my business,\u201d user \u201cdogdaygod\u201d explained to Besa Mafia, adding the death should \u201clook like an accident.\u201d That image was hard to sync with Amy\u2019s life. The 43-year-old ran her own dog training business. She and her husband Stephen had met at a Christian college and were devout members of a local United Church of God congregation, according to news reports. Stephen served as a church elder and offered marriage counseling to couples. They had an adopted son. Local law enforcement met with the Allwines about the alleged threats, the Pioneer Press reported. But there was little they could do about an anonymous Internet user apparently plotting to take her life, beyond suggesting increased security. In August, Stephen got a permit for a 9mm Springfield XDS handgun, authorities say. But the Dark Web machinations suddenly took on new significance in November 2016 when Amy Allwine was discovered dead on the floor of her bedroom. Initially thought to be a suicide, police soon suspected foul play. Within months, they would allege Stephen Allwine was actually \u201cdogdaygod.\u201d He had killed his wife after Besa Mafia failed to come through. This week Allwine went on trial for premeditated first-degree murder. The situation laid out by prosecutors was a mix of religious guilt and piety, online double lives and desperate measures. According to the prosecutors, Stephen, an Internet technology specialist, had begun cheating on his wife using the infidelity site, Ashley Madison. But to him, divorce was not an option. \u201cHe was seeing other women but he didn\u2019t want to divorce her because of his position in the church,\u201d Washington County prosecutor Jamie Kreuser told a jury this week, the Star Tribune reported. Stephen\u2019s attorney, Kevin DeVore, emphasized in his opening remarks there was little physical evidence tying his client to the crime. \u201cIt sounds like an amazing story, but it\u2019s not a TV show or a movie but real life,\u201d the attorney said, adding: \u201cJust because he had an affair doesn\u2019t mean he killed his wife.\u201d Divorce \u2014 and its religious implications within the Allwines\u2019s faith \u2014 is the central piece of the prosecution\u2019s theory. The United Church of God views on marriage run conservative. \u201cCouples who decide to marry are expected to know one another well enough, before they marry, in order to assess as closely as possible how they will get along after marriage. The Church strongly recommends counseling with the ministry,\u201d the church\u2019s website says. \u201cEven if couples have a short courtship, fail to counsel before marrying or have dysfunctional backgrounds, none of these recognized troubles justify the later putting away of [divorcing] a mate with the freedom to remarry. Marriage is a commitment for life. Failure to plan properly is not grounds for the future dissolving of a marriage.\u201d Prosecutors allege that Stephen first learned about Ashley Madison, a dating site for cheating spouses, while counseling married couples in his congregation. He had affairs with at least two women he met on the site, law enforcement alleged. Wishing to end his marriage but denied divorce, Stephen allegedly burrowed into the Dark Web for an answer. Besa Mafia, however, was not actually an outfit of Albanian contract killers. It was a ruse. \u201cWe have zero information at this point that any of the hits that were ordered on that website were actually carried out,\u201d a Minnesota detective told Fox 9. \u201cIn fact there is pretty good evidence, I think, that it was just a scam.\u201d \u201cDogdaygod\u201d paid the site at least $6000 in bitcoin to arrange Amy Allwine\u2019s death, prosecutors say. The user provided details of her movements. But the hit never happened. Instead, on November 13, Stephen called 911. He and his son had just found Amy\u2019s body, he reported. Police arrived around 7 p.m., discovering Amy on the floor of the couple\u2019s bedroom, blood pooling out of a gunshot wound in her head, the Pioneer Press reported. A handgun \u2014 the 9mm Springfield XDS Stephen had purchased three months earlier \u2014 was lying near her left forearm. It initially appeared Amy had killed herself. But investigators quickly decided it was meant to look that way. There were no powder burns or stippling on the victim\u2019s head, meaning the gun was not pressed against her temple when it was fired. Gunpowder and blood also were not detected on Amy\u2019s hands.  Psycho For Love: Stephen Carl Allwine charged with the murder of his wife, Amy Allwine,\u2026 https://t.co/Sxc0qC9Irv pic.twitter.com/yoiK8lkDgf  \u2014 Bonnie Kernene (@mylifeofcrime) January 21, 2017 The gun was lying on her left side, but she was right-handed. The house\u2019s security camera footage showed only Stephen entering and exiting the property, prosecutors say. Police detected traces of bloody footprints between the kitchen and the bedroom. The medical examiner also found swimming in Amy\u2019s system a large amount of scopolamine, a nausea treatment that can incapacitate someone who takes high doses. She had no prescription for the drug. Search warrants on Stephen\u2019s computers showed he had been accessing the Dark Web since 2014, the City Pages reported. Investigators also discovered a 35-character bitcoin transaction code on a backup drive for the suspect\u2019s cellphone. The same code was used by \u201cdogdaygod\u201d in the user\u2019s transactions with the Besa Mafia account, prosecutors say. Investigators would later uncover that \u201cdogdaygod\u201d had posted on other dark websites about scopolamine. In court this week, Stephen\u2019s attorney DeVore argued the physical evidence at the crime scene was \u201ccontaminated\u201d after officers removed the handgun from the bedroom to unload the weapon. The attorney also says the defense will argue the timeline of Amy\u2019s death will show Stephen could not have killed his wife. The trial, entering its third day, continues.

The Power of Big Green Money In Part One, we considered the class-warfare dimension of the debate over climate change: the plutocrats vs. the people. The immediate flashpoint, of course, is President Trump\u2019s decision to exit the Paris Climate Accord, which we might dub \u201cPar-exit,\u201d as a play on Brexit. Indeed, the conflation of the two exits seems fair: In both cases, big money was on one side, and ordinary people, and their respective national sovereignties, were on the other side. So now let\u2019s look at the future policy implications of this class war, and what must be done to secure middle-class American jobs in the future. Let\u2019s begin with a clear-eyed understanding of just how much big-money-power is aligned on the side of the greens. In the previous installment, we noted that much of the Rockefeller family is fully on board with green activism. Indeed, we can marvel at the fact that across the centuries\u2014from the 19th-century days of the Standard Oil monopoly to the attempted green hegemony of the 21st century\u2014the Rockefellers seem always to end up in opposition to the middle class. Evidently, great wealth has that effect on a family dynasty, both then and now. Yet on the issue of climate change today, it\u2019s not just the trust-fund rich that have dedicated themselves to this cause; it\u2019s also true for many of the top executives currently running corporate America. For example, Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, blasted Trump\u2019s Paris decision, as did Elon Musk of Tesla and Jeff Immelt of General Electric. To be sure, most CEOs were quiet about the Paris decision, and some were even supportive. Still, we can see that the combined weight of all this money-power is doing everything it can to squeeze, even crush, the use of fossil fuels. That is, all that loot can pay for a combination of bad press, boycotts, voluntary renunciations, litigation, and state-and-local regulation; the result of all this pressure could well be that the energy expansion that Trump hopes for can still be stopped, maybe even reversed. To see how this anaconda-like squeezing is already having an impact, we might consider the case of ExxonMobil. Just last month, New York City-based Black Rock, the investment behemoth that manages a whopping $5.4 trillion, forced a dramatic shift in ExxonMobil\u2019s policy stance on climate change. Yes, ExxonMobil is itself a huge corporation\u2014the second largest in America by revenue\u2014but it is owned by its shareholders, most of them institutional investors. So Black Rock teamed up with two other financial giants, Vanguard and State Street, to use their combined 18 percent stake in ExxonMobil to ram through that policy shift. Thus we can see: Even the largest industrial companies can be brought to heel by the massed power of finance. Some might wonder: Why would Black Rock and the others want ExxonMobil to take a policy position contrary to their own financial interests? After all, it\u2019s hard to see how Exxon, or any oil company, will do better by selling less oil in the future. To answer this question, we might start by observing that investment moguls have to live somewhere, and they have relationships with colleagues, friends, and family. And if most of these bigs shots are clustered around New York City, it\u2019s not shocking that they develop\u2014if they don\u2019t already possess\u2014the liberal values of their sociocultural environment. Indeed, as we all know, the human herding instinct is a powerful force; peer pressure has a way of changing behavior. Thus the urge to stay with the \u201cin group\u201d is often more important than the need to maximize the bottom line\u2014and the ExxonMobil case proves it. Still, the bottom lines of the rich are doing just fine. Today, the top 10 percent in America earn more than the lower 90 percent, and that\u2019s a huge shift in their favor over just four decades. And at the same time, the effective federal tax rate on the ultra-rich has gone down. In other words, the plutocrat class is doing just fine, thank you very much. We can quickly observe that if the wealthy were content just to enjoy their wealth, they wouldn\u2019t be a problem; after all, one person\u2019s opulence is another person\u2019s sustenance. However, as we saw with the Rockefellers, the possession of a great fortune often means, as well, the possession of a certain worldview; things appear different from the window of a private jet. Indeed, if we examine this 3-D map of wealth in America, we can see that the richest locales tend to correlate closely with liberalism and Democratic Party strength. Yes, it might seem strange to think that billionaires would be Democrats, given the Democrats\u2019 rhetorical emphasis on \u201csoaking the rich,\u201d and yet as we have seen, the rich have mostly emancipated themselves from paying taxes, with the tacit nods of Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama (and perhaps it\u2019s not a coincidence that the Clintons and Obamas are now both themselves multi-millionaires). In other words, if there\u2019s no threat to the rich from a Democratic IRS, then the plutocracy can indulge itself by using politics to address other concerns, mostly environmental and cultural issues. A decade ago, the astute social observers Joel Kotkin and Fred Siegel coined a phrase for this top-down political phenomenon: \u201cgentry liberalism.\u201d That is, rich Democrats can now buy much of the political system and thus a gain a chance to remake the nation, and maybe even the world, as they see fit. More recently, Kotkin and Siegel have gone even further: They have equated gentry liberalism to feudalism\u2014that is, oligarchic rule by the rich and powerful. To get a sense of where this sort of politics can lead, we might look west, to California. There, the billionaire class presides over a state that\u2019s becoming ever less friendly to the middle class, and their jobs. Yet from a liberal billionaire\u2019s point of view, this hostility is a feature, not a bug. Why? Because a shrinking middle class means fewer of those pesky Republicans. In the meantime, Democratic-dominated California is working to perfect its ecological consciousness. Its governor, Jerry Brown, is perhaps the greenest state executive in America; he called Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord \u201cinsane,\u201d and has spearheaded the effort to make California go even further on CO2 reductions. One has a right to wonder how this sort of neo-feudal politics will work out in the long run; after all, in old Europe, feudalism usually dissolved into civil war and violent revolution. However, in the short run, our task is to consider American politics as they are today. II. The Power Consequences of Slow Growth As we know, the U.S. economy, overall, has grown slowly in recent years. Barack Obama was the first president in at least seven decades never to see, in any year of his presidency, economic growth reach even three percent. In fact, the average growth rate during his time in office was a mere 1.48 percent, barely above population growth. In other words, all of Obama\u2019s bright promises\u2014\u201cfive million green jobs\u201d and bountiful plenty for the vast middle\u2014were proven to be hollow. Yet at the same time, under Obama, the stock market zoomed, and we\u2019ve already seen who has reaped most of the benefits of that zoom. Some might ask: What could account for the seemingly paradoxical combination of slow growth in the economy and fast growth in the stock market? Answer: The U.S. stock market is no longer a dependent variable of the domestic economy; it\u2019s now a function of the world economy. In other words, if China is doing fine, then it\u2019s likely that American investors, too, are doing fine. By this reckoning, Middle American well-being is simply an afterthought, and not much of a priority. Meanwhile, across the whole of the U.S., the consequences of Obamanomics are now measurable. We might note that one measurer is Thomas Edsall, a rare type of MSM journalist, insofar as he devotes himself to chronicling the struggles of ordinary Americans. In particular, Edsall has come to report on the deepening divide between urban and rural America, as the former taps into the globalized economic jet-stream, while the latter is consigned to the slow zone. As Edsall notes, since 2009, employment in metropolitan areas has risen 4.8 percent, while employment in non-metropolitan areas has shrunk 2.4 percent. Another Edsall finding tells us that during the 90s, cities of over a million people accounted for 16 percent of new job creation, and then just two decades later, in the 10s, the biggest cities accounted for 41 percent of jobs created. In other words, the cities are now hopping. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal recently added this bleak headline: \u201cRural America is the New \u2018Inner City.\u2019\u201d So, given what has happened to the well-being rural America under their watch, is it any wonder that the Democrats would rather change the subject to climate change? So now, enter Trump. He has yet to prove that he is a master of a robust legislative agenda, but he obviously recognizes the need to stop the harm being done to Middle America. In his June 1 remarks at the White House , Trump declared that the \u201conerous energy restrictions\u201d of the Paris Agreement could have cost 2.7 million American their jobs by 2025. Then, looking further ahead to the impact on production by 2040, the President got specific, sector by sector: \u201cpaper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.\u201d Those losses, and losses to other sectors, would have totaled 6.5 million industrial jobs, with GDP down by $3 trillion. In other words, Middle America, thanks to Trump, has missed a bullet\u2014a green bullet. Yet the mere fact that things won\u2019t get worse doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll get better. In fact, if things continue as they are, with the financial deck stacked in favor of blue-dot America, at the expense of red-state America, then there can be no certainty of an economic recovery for Trump Nation. In addition, there can also be no certainty that some future U.S. government won\u2019t reimpose the Paris limits or, perhaps, go even further, all the way to zeroing out fossil fuels, as many leading greens advocate. Yes, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that everything Trump has just done can be undone after the next election. That is, if President Obama put us into Paris with an executive action, and if President Trump took us out with an executive action, then the next president could do just about anything\u2014in, out, in-between. So we can see: The ultimate hope for Middle American jobs is to make permanent the viability, even desirability, of fossil fuels\u2014that is, to Paris-proof them. And yet fossil fuels will only be safe to use, long term, if they are safeguarded by the addition of new clean technology, endorsed and ratified by specific Congressional action. III. Cleaned-Up Fossil Fuels to Boost Jobs and Growth  If you want to see what better times in the Heartland look like, consider this story that appeared in, of all places, The Washington Post. Datelined Gillette, Wyoming, the article was headlined, \u201cHow \u2018the Energy Capital of the Nation\u2019 regained its optimism in the Trump era.\u201d The piece recalled that in January 2016, the Obama administration commanded a moratorium on the leasing of federal lands for coal mining. As the Post put it, \u201cThat was a direct hit to Gillette, where most mining was done on federal land.\u201d As a result, many mine workers were laid off early last year, and, as the Post put it, Gillette \u201cspiraled down.\u201d At the same time, the newspaper added grimly about the seeming fate of the miners: \u201cDemocrats, led by presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, declared their jobs passe.\u201d Might that be the reason that Clinton won just 21.9 percent of the vote in the Cowboy State? Yet now, in the Trump era, the mines have reopened, and Gillette has bounced back; the Post even shined the spotlight on a same-sex couple whose new restaurant is booming. Thus we are reminded that John F. Kennedy was right: \u201cA rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d So here\u2019s a question: Why can\u2019t more of America enjoy the coal-driven prosperity of Wyoming? And the answer is, more states can, provided that the necessary precondition is in place. And that necessary precondition is positive action to mitigate carbon dioxide, aka, greenhouse gas. To be sure, some will argue that the whole theory of climate change, or global warming, is a misnomer, even a hoax. And perhaps it is. Or perhaps it isn\u2019t. Either way, if the previous 4,000 words in these articles mean anything, then a politically attuned observer will conclude, however reluctantly, that the greens, with all their their money- and media muscle, aren\u2019t going anywhere. In other words, the mismatched wealth relationship between blue and red America needs to be factored in. And so the prudent path is to think about a constructive compromise that gives something to both sides. Yes, the fossil-fuel forces have Trump. And yet the anti-fossil-fuelers, here and around the world, also have plenty of punch. As a result, if the pro-fossil fuel forces wish to keep their recent gains\u2014and continue to make progress in the future, come what may, election-wise\u2014they will have to show genuine forward motion on the issue of climate change. To put that another way, they will have to \u201csweeten the pot\u201d in re: clean, green, technology. Fortunately, such clean tech already exists\u2014although we need a lot more of it. Much of that technology falls into the category of carbon capture, that is, finding a way to sequester CO2 out of the atmosphere. As this author has argued in detail, carbon capture is the best way to have our cake and eat it, too. With effective carbon capture, we can enjoy the enormous benefits of fossil fuels, including coal, without the risk of enormous environmental costs. Admittedly, carbon capture hasn\u2019t received much attention, perhaps because the two ideological polarities on the climate issue would rather fight than work together to solve the problem. And yet even so, carbon capture is a big enterprise; earlier this year, the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s Jack Gerard reported that from 2000 to 2014, the public and private sectors spent a total of $303 billion on carbon capture. So we can see: Already carbon capture, in and of itself, means a lot of economic activity for red-state Americans. Today, carbon capture means mostly re-injecting CO2 into the ground, often as an aid to fracking. And yet with more research and development, pilot projects that have have already turned CO2 into useful things\u2014including landfill, concrete, plastic, and new energy\u2014can be escalated into large-scale industrial product-lines. And if such carbon capture could be truly \u201cscaled,\u201d then the entire U.S. economy would be transformed, as vast energy vistas would open up. It\u2019s been estimated, for example, that the value of oil and natural gas under federal lands and waters is $128 trillion. To put that number in perspective, that\u2019s more than six times the size of U.S. GDP, and also six times the size of the U.S. national debt. And we should emphasize: $128 trillion is just the value of oil and gas\u2014not including coal\u2014on federal property. The dollar total for all fossil fuels, under all American lands, is in the many hundreds of trillions. So if we could find a politically and environmentally acceptable way to get at that wealth, we wouldn\u2019t just be sitting pretty\u2014we\u2019d be downright gorgeous. So now we might drill down, pardon the pun, on a single state: Illinois. As everyone knows, that Heartland state, once rich, has fallen on hard times. After years of chronic budget crises, Illinois now has a bond rating of BBB-minus, just a notch above junk-bond status. To be precise about it, Illinois owes $14.5 billion that it doesn\u2019t have. Yet at the same time, according to the Illinois State Geological Survey, the Land of Lincoln has 200 billion tons of coal, of which, given present-day prices and technology, 38 billion tons are rated as \u201crecoverable.\u201d In other words, at the current price of around $30 a ton, the recoverable coal is worth some $1.1 trillion. And yet today, Illinois produces only about 32 million tons of coal a year; that\u2019s a microscopic .08 percent of what\u2019s currently possible. So we can see: Illinois is sitting atop vast wealth, and yet, at the moment, it has no feasible way of accessing it. And of course, if coal were ever to become a focus of energy research, as it once was, then it\u2019s likely that Illinois could find an acceptable way to recover a lot more of that 200-billion-ton grand total. We can add: the same sort of mega-dollar calculations would hold true, as well, for many other states. Happily, some visionaries are ready to help move Illinois, and all of America, forward on this journey toward techno-empowered abundance. One such is the Trump administration\u2019s Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry. The Energy Department has long supported\u2014even under Obama, however quietly\u2014carbon capture as part of a portfolio of forward-looking energy strategies. For his part, as the longest-serving governor of Texas, Perry was a champion of carbon capture, as seen, for instance, at Houston\u2019s Petra Nova plant. Today, as a key figure in the Trump administration\u2019s emerging energy strategy, Perry stands ready to expand his scope to the nation as a whole. On June 1, for example, he tweeted, \u201cI fully support @POTUS\u2019 decision on the #ParisAccord. The U.S. will continue to be a leader in energy technology, development, & delivery.\u201d So we can see: Innovative technology is available to start making full, and clean, use of ancient forms of energy. What\u2019s deemed to be dirty today can be made clean tomorrow. Moreover, out of newfound cleanliness could come a new consensus; namely, a bipartisan, and thus enduring, commitment to responsibly re-energize the Heartland. Needless to say, the hardcore greens would hate the idea, but then, as we all know, they hate everything that\u2019s not made out of burlap\u2014or hemp. Yet in the meantime, plenty of middle-of-the-road Americans, concerned about climate change yet desirous of economic growth, could come to recognize carbon capture as the win-win that we have been waiting for. Yes, carbon capture is an exciting technology, offering the hope that we can, indeed, Make America Great Again\u2014all of it."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

She is brilliant, thoughtful and famously well-read, with a long history of activism. She has a great American story, enormous empathy and an extraordinary ability to communicate powerfully and authentically, as we saw during her speech at the Golden Globes. Standing before a country hungry for a unifying, optimistic message, Oprah was kinetic, triggering an instant sensation on social media where #Oprah2020 has been blazing since. In an interview after the Globes, her longtime companion, Stedman Graham, tossed a log -- ok, more like a tree trunk -- on the fire when he said that Oprah \"absolutely would do it,\" adding that it is \"up to the people.\" It's hard to say whether Stedman was acting purposefully or, moved by Oprah's remarkable performance and post-show libations, simply got carried away.

A candidate surrenders control over his or her life and subjugates everything to the voracious needs of the campaign.

Among the more than 600,000 people who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh, many are survivors of rape, gang rape and sexual slavery. How many? Pramila Patten, the United Nations special representative on sexual violence in conflict, reports that every woman she encountered during her November visit to Bangladesh had either witnessed or endured brutal sexual assault. Their stories are harrowing. One 15-year-old girl was ruthlessly dragged on the ground for over 50 feet, tied to a tree and then raped by 10 Burmese soldiers. Patten has urged the U.N. Security Council to take action. To be sure, the rape of Rohingya women is a gross violation of human rights. But why should the Security Council \u2014 charged with maintaining international peace and security \u2014 address sexual violence? Because sexual violence in conflict is not simply a human rights issue \u2014 it\u2019s also a security challenge, according to a significant body of social science research, which we highlight in our recent Council on Foreign Relations report. What\u2019s more, widespread rape in wartime can be prevented. Here are five key insights into how this works. 1. Sexual violence is often a symptom of military weakness. Sexual violence committed by troops can signal weak command and troop discipline, which makes military units less effective in their mission. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a mass rape of more than 150 civilians in 2011 was attributed to local armed forces\u2019 lax command and control structures. When state forces regularly commit sexual violence, the command hierarchy may simply be too weak to enforce a policy forbidding this crime \u2014 and therefore may be ineffective in maintaining peace once a conflict is resolved. In other cases, armed groups that recruit through abduction command those troops to rape in order to build solidarity among them. These groups have lower levels of unit cohesion and effectiveness than groups that rely on volunteers. A review of 91 civil wars, for example, found that groups that recruit by force committed significantly higher levels of rape against civilians, in an attempt to build social bonds through rape. While groups or individuals commit sexual violence in conflict for any number of reasons, when it happens there are strategic implications. Research shows that military units and law enforcement bodies that respect human rights and prevent sexual violence are more effective at promoting security. 2. Sexual violence can increase the flow of refugees. When armed groups commit sexual violence, more people flee \u2014 making the region less stable. As we can see from the staggering number of Rohingya refugees, wartime rape forces people from their homes, depriving them and their families of their livelihoods, property and access to health services and education, destabilizing communities. Sexual violence has increased displacement around the world, from Guatemala to Iraq to Syria, where reports suggest that the danger of rape is a primary reason people flee cities under siege.", "Rohingya women cry while watching a graphic video of the Tula Toli massacre in their home in Thaingkhali Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh in December. (Allison Joyce for The Washington Post)  3. Unchecked sexual violence can undermine trust in the state. Conflict-related sexual violence signals a government\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens. That\u2019s particularly true when, as in South Sudan, the military commits this crime widely and with impunity. The lower citizens\u2019 level of trust in the state, the more difficult it becomes for a government to undertake economic, social or political reforms, which undermines stability. 4. Countries with widespread sexual violence incur high financial costs. Wartime rape is costly in ways that undermine national stability. Victims of sexual violence may suffer long-term physical and psychological aftereffects, which impose high costs of care, reduced economic productivity and lost income. In the DRC, for instance, agricultural output decreased partly because women were afraid to return to working in the fields. Further, some evidence suggests that sexual violence during wartime continues as gender-based violence in peacetime, leaving behind still more costs long after the conflict has ceased. In Burma, neighboring governments are bearing the burden of these costs, with the support of humanitarian agencies that provide services to Rohingya refugees. 5. Sexual violence can undermine reconciliation efforts after ethnic conflicts. Particularly when it\u2019s ethnically driven, sexual violence used as a tactic of war can make reconciliation much harder \u2014 including any efforts the Burmese government may pledge to pursue if the Rohingya return. Women raped by opposing parties are often stigmatized, treated as guilty by association with their perpetrators. Children born of rape frequently suffer discrimination, fostering tension in a community long after the conflict. Rape in wartime corrodes future stability \u2014 but it is not inevitable. It\u2019s true that throughout history, many armies considered rape to be one of the legitimate spoils of war; this crime was tacitly accepted as unavoidable through the early 20th century. But more recently, legal rulings have outlawed sexual violence and recognized it as a war crime. And research shows that while some conflicts include widespread sexual violence, not all do: One analysis of 177 armed groups in 21 African countries found that 59 percent were not reported to have committed sexual violence. Another analysis of 91 civil wars between 1980 and 2012 revealed that 17 percent did not include widespread sexual violence. In other words, armed groups don\u2019t always rape with impunity; levels of sexual violence vary from one conflict to another. That\u2019s because while some leaders of armed organizations may order or tolerate rape by their soldiers, others prohibit it. That suggests that sexual violence in conflict can be prevented. Research has revealed best practices around the world, from community-based police reforms initiated in Nicaragua in the 1990s to innovative prosecutorial approaches recently instituted in the DRC. It\u2019s possible, therefore, to drive down sexual violence in conflict \u2014 and evidence suggests that doing so matters to security and stability.

Credit Gabe Souza/Portland Press Herald, via Getty Images", "EGGS over easy, home fries, bacon and toast. It\u2019s $9.99 at Tops Diner in Newark but $5.79 at Pop\u2019s Diner near Oklahoma City. If the same meal in two parts of the country has such a different price, should America have a single national minimum wage? As recently as three years ago, Democrats led by President Barack Obama had settled on pushing a national minimum wage increase to $10.10, up from $7.25, which was set in 2009. Since then, a movement working on behalf of low-wage workers has pushed for a $15 national minimum wage in what is known as the Fight for $15. This noble movement has succeeded in several high-cost cities, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, where wages are set to rise on a glide path to $15 in several years\u2019 time. But a wage floor that is right for the high-cost coasts may be the wrong fit elsewhere. After all, in a 2016 report we noted that a typical dentist appointment in Jackson, Tenn., ran $67, but it was $108 in San Francisco. A dozen eggs was $3.99 in Oakland, Calif., but 93 cents in Fargo, N.D. And according to the real estate website Rent Jungle, a two-bedroom apartment in the Los Angeles metro area runs $2,907 per month. In Philadelphia it\u2019s $1,739; in Jacksonville, Fla., it\u2019s $1,112. Seen in this context, the fight for $15 makes more sense for people living in Brooklyn, where parking can run $30 a day, than it does for people in Cumberland, Md., where a space costs $35 per month. And it explains the very different minimum-wage levels that have been set in different states. In 2014, in addition to Seattle and San Francisco\u2019s vote for $15, Arkansas, Alaska, South Dakota and Nebraska all chose to raise their minimum wages. In these four rural, lower-cost states, the new minimum wages rose to between $8.50 and $9.75. That is why the national minimum wage should instead be a range of national minimum wages that recognizes the differences in living cost and labor markets in a way that is both flexible and permanent. We suggest setting this standard to exactly one-half of the median wage for the average hourly, nonsupervisory wage worker in America. In January, that computed to a wage of $10.90 per hour, which would be the highest minimum wage of all time in real dollars. At this level, a full-time minimum-wage earner with two children would surpass the federal poverty level by more than $1,000, even before such federal benefits as the earned-income tax credit are taken into account. Next, the purchasing power of the minimum wage should be roughly the same across the nation, from Palm Springs, Calif., to Youngstown, Ohio. To do this, regions would be placed in one of five categories based on what the government calls regional price parities, which is a measurement of the difference in prices for similar products between regions. In the highest-cost areas, like New York City and Newark, the minimum wage would be set at 15 percent above the national average, or $12.55. In low-cost places, like Valdosta, Ga., the minimum wage would climb to $9.25, or 15 percent below the $10.90 national average minimum wage that workers in Flagstaff, Ariz., and elsewhere would earn. Each January, the minimum wages would rise based on the new median wage for hourly workers. Could America handle a tiered minimum wage? We already do. Twenty-nine states now set their wage floor above $7.25, so different minimum wages shouldn\u2019t be a problem. And states and cities would still be free to set a higher wage under this proposal. The regional minimum wage is not so much a compromise but a modern look at an old problem. We are one country, but hundreds of different micro-economies grappling with the technological forces that are changing the nature of work and replacing low-wage employment with kiosks and machines. That is why that the political battle for the minimum wage has been as much a regional skirmish as a partisan one. Under our plan, everyone would eventually get to a $15 minimum wage, but high-cost areas, like many along the Acela Corridor and the Pacific Coast, would reach and quickly exceed that threshold at the right pace for their economies. An approach like this could pave the political path for a substantial and permanent minimum wage increase for millions of Americans, and that\u2019s not nothing.

Here is audio of the full, unedited interview. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)  FREDERICK RYAN JR., WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHER: Mr. Trump, welcome to the Washington Post. Thank you for making time to meet with our editorial board. DONALD TRUMP: New building. Yes this is very nice. Good luck with it. RYAN: Thank you\u2026 We\u2019ve heard you\u2019re going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortly\u2026 Any you can share with us? TRUMP: Well, I hadn\u2019t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names\u2026 Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he\u2019s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that\u2019s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that\u2019s a representative group. FRED HIATT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Do you want to start out? TRUMP: No, other than to say, we\u2019re working hard, I think we\u2019re all in the same business of trying to make our country better, a better place, so we have something in common. I\u2019ve been treated very, very badly by The Washington Post, but, you know, I guess \u2014 and I\u2019m your neighbor, I\u2019m your neighbor right down the road, in fact we\u2019re actually giving a press conference there in a little while, I think your people are going to be there. And by the way, Bob Costa is an excellent reporter, I\u2019ve found him to be just an excellent reporter. I should tell you, because I have to give you the good and the bad. Not that he does me any favors, because he doesn\u2019t, but he\u2019s a real professional. So we\u2019re having a news conference today in the new building that\u2019s going up, and the building is very much ahead of schedule, because it was supposed to open two years from September, and we\u2019re going to open it in September. We could open it actually sooner but we\u2019re going to break it in a little bit, so we\u2019re going to open it in September, and it\u2019s under budget, even though we\u2019ve increased the quality of the finishes substantially, marble finishes, very high quality of marble, so we\u2019re under budget and ahead of schedule. And I\u2019m, you know, I am that way when I build, I know how to build, I know how to get things done. The GSA [General Services Administration], I will say, GSA has been very professional, they\u2019ve been very, very professional. They chose us over\u2014I think they had more than 100 people who bid, you can imagine, because of the location, but they had over 100 people that bid, and it was broken down into ten finalists, and I got it. We got it because of the strength of my financial statement and also because of the strength of what we were proposing. So we\u2019re having a news conference there today. What time is that, Hope? HOPE HICKS, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON: It\u2019s at 2:15. TRUMP: 2:15. I hear a lot of the press is going to be there, we\u2019re going to give them a tour of the building. It\u2019s still a little bit rough \u2014 as an example, a lot of the marble surfaces all have sheetrock covering, and plywood covering on them, so a lot of people won\u2019t see as much as they think. It\u2019ll be like a miracle, you take it off and it explodes, like it\u2019s finished, right? But that\u2019ll be a fun news conference. HIATT: If I could, I\u2019d start by asking is there a secretary of state and a secretary of defense in the modern era who you think have done a good job? Who do you think were the best? TRUMP: Well, because I know so many of them, and because in many cases I like them, I hate to get totally involved. I think George Shultz was very good, I thought he was excellent. I can tell you, I think your last secretary of state and your current secretary of state have not done much. I think John Kerry\u2019s deal with Iran is one of the worst things that I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated of any kind. It\u2019s just a horrible giveaway. HIATT: What in particular? TRUMP: Well, I think, number one, we shouldn\u2019t have given the money back. I think, number two, we should have had our prisoners before the negotiations started. We should have doubled up the sanctions. We should have gone in and said, \u2018release our prisoners,\u2019 they would have said \u2018no,\u2019 and we would have said, \u2018double up the sanctions,\u2019 and within a short period of time we would have had our prisoners back. And I think that was a terrible mistake. I think giving the money back was a terrible mistake. And by the way they are not using the money on us, they are not buying anything from us, they\u2019re buying, you noticed, they didn\u2019t buy Boeing, they bought Airbus, 118 planes from what I understand, but they bought them all from Airbus, they go out of their way not to spend any money in our country. So I wouldn\u2019t have done that. And I think it\u2019s going to just lead, actually, to nuclear problems. I also think it\u2019s going to be bad for Israel. It\u2019s a very bad deal for Israel. HIATT: George Shultz, it\u2019s interesting, was associated with a foreign policy of Reagan that was very much devoted to promoting democracy and freedom overseas. Is that something you think in today\u2019s world the United States should be doing? TRUMP: I do think it\u2019s a different world today and I don\u2019t think we should be nation building anymore. I think it\u2019s proven not to work. And we have a different country than we did then. You know we have 19 trillion dollars in debt. We\u2019re sitting probably on a bubble and, you know, it\u2019s a bubble that if it breaks is going to be very nasty. And I just think we have to rebuild our country. If you look at the infrastructure \u2014 I just landed at an airport where, not in good shape, not in good shape. If you go to Qatar and if you go to (inaudible) you see airports the likes of which you have never seen before. Dubai, different places in China. You see infrastructure, you see airports, other things, the likes of which you have never seen here. HIATT: Short of nation building, is there any role in promoting values or democracy? Or that\u2019s not something\u2026 TRUMP: Well, there is, I just think that we have values in our country that we have to promote. We have a country that is in bad shape, it\u2019s in bad condition. You look at our inner cities, our inner cities are a horrible mess. I watched Baltimore, I have many, many friends in Baltimore, we watched what happened. St. Louis, Ferguson, Oakland, it could have been much worse over the summer. And it will probably be worse this summer. But you look at some of our inner cities. And yet you know I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they\u2019d be blown up. And we\u2019d build another one and it would get blown up. And we would rebuild it three times. And yet we can\u2019t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we can\u2019t build in our own country. And at what point do you say hey, we have to take care of ourselves. So, you know, I know the outer world exists and I\u2019ll be very cognizant of that but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially in the inner cities. HIATT: So what would you do for Baltimore, let\u2019s say. TRUMP: Well, number one, I\u2019d create economic zones. I\u2019d create incentives for companies to move in. I\u2019d work on spirit because the spirit is so low, it\u2019s incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African American youth, is 58-59 percent. It\u2019s unthinkable. Unemployment for African Americans \u2013 not youth, but African Americans \u2013 is very high. And I would create in the inner cities, which is what I really do best, that\u2019s why when I open a building and I show you it\u2019s way ahead of schedule, under budget and everything else\u2014I think it was the Rite Aid store, the store in Baltimore it took them 20 years to get it built, one store, and then it burned down in one night\u2014we have to create incentives for people to love what they are doing, and to make money. And to create, you know, to really create a better life for themselves. And you can\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem right that you will have a situation like Baltimore, and many other places, let\u2019s use Baltimore as an example, there are many Baltimores in this country. Detroit is maybe even a better example than Baltimore. But that you\u2019ll have a situation like that, and then we\u2019re over nation building with other, with countries that in many cases don\u2019t want us there. They want our money, but they don\u2019t want us. HIATT: The root of many people\u2019s unhappiness in Baltimore was the perception that blacks are treated differently by law enforcement. And the disproportionate \u2013 do you think it\u2019s a problem that the percentage of blacks in prison is higher than whites, and what do you think is the root of that situation? TRUMP: Well I\u2019ve never really see anything that \u2013 you know, I feel very strongly about law enforcement. And, you know, if you look at the riot that took place over the summer, if that were stopped \u2013 it all, it mostly took place on the first evening, and if that were stopped on the first evening, you know, you\u2019d have a much nicer city right now, because much of that damage and much of the destruction was done on Evening One. So I feel that law enforcement, it\u2019s got to play a big role. It\u2019s got to play a big role. But that\u2019s a pretty good example, because tremendous amounts of damage was done that first evening \u2013 first two evenings, but the first evening in particular. And so I\u2019m a very strong believer in law enforcement, but I\u2019m also a very strong believer that the inner cities can come back. HIATT: Do you see any racial disparities in law enforcement \u2013 I mean, what set it off was the Freddie Gray killing, as you know. Is that an issue that concerns you? TRUMP: Well, look, I mean, I have to see what happens with the trial. I\u2014 HIATT: Well, forget Freddie Gray, but in general, do you believe there are disparities in law enforcement? TRUMP: I\u2019ve read where there are and I\u2019ve read where there aren\u2019t. I mean, I\u2019ve read both. And, you know, I have no opinion on that. Because frankly, what I\u2019m saying is you know we have to create incentives for people to go back and to reinvigorate the areas and to put people to work. And you know we have lost million and millions of jobs to China and other countries. And they\u2019ve been taken out of this country, and when I say millions, you know it\u2019s, it\u2019s tremendous. I\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs, I\u2019ve seen numbers that range from 6 million to, to smaller numbers. But it\u2019s many millions of jobs, and it\u2019s to countries all over. Mexico is really becoming the new China. And I have great issue with that. Because you know I use in speeches sometimes Ford or sometimes I use Carrier \u2013 it\u2019s all the same: Ford, Carrier, Nabisco, so many of the companies \u2014 they\u2019re moving to Mexico now. And you know we shouldn\u2019t be allowing that to happen. And tremendous unemployment, tremendous. They\u2019re allowing tremendous people that have worked for the companies for a long time, they\u2019re allowing, if they want to move around and they want to work on incentives within the United States, that\u2019s one thing, but when they take these companies out of the United States. Other countries are outsmarting us by giving them advantages, you know, like in the case of Mexico. In the case of many other countries. Like Ireland is, you\u2019re losing Pfizer to Ireland, a great pharmaceutical company that with many, many jobs and it\u2019s going to move to Ireland. RUTH MARCUS, COLUMNIST: But Mr. Trump, if I could just follow up on Fred\u2019s question. I think that what he was trying to get at was the anger in the African American community that held some of the riots and disturbances this summer about disparate treatment and about \u2026 clearly you say you\u2019ve read where there is disparate treatment. But it is pretty undeniable that there is disproportionate incarceration of African Americans vs. whites. What would you \u2013 is that something that concerns you? TRUMP: That would concern me, Ruth. It would concern me. But at the same time it can be solved to a large extant with jobs. You know, if we can rebuild those communities and create incentives for companies to move in and create jobs. Jobs are so important. There are no jobs. There are none. You go to those communities and you can\u2019t \u2013 there is nothing there. There is no incentive for people. It is a very sad situation. And what makes it even sadder is that we are spending so much money in other countries and our own country has vast pockets of poverty and a lot of this is caused by the fact that there are no jobs. So we can create jobs in places like Baltimore and Detroit. You know, Detroit made a move, but I don\u2019t know but it just seems to be fizzling. I don\u2019t know what is going on. I watched Detroit four, five years ago and it looked like they were really putting a full-court press on and it doesn\u2019t seem to be, from what I\u2019ve been told, friends of mine that are very much involved in that whole process that it doesn\u2019t seem to be, doesn\u2019t seem to be something that is being pursued like it should be pursued. But if we can create jobs, it will solve so many problems. CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER/COLUMNIST: Can I follow up on that? I mean, to take the case of Baltimore, I mean one of the things that\u2019s so remarkable about Baltimore and Detroit is that both of these cities, like many others have been \u2013 it\u2019s not as if no one has ever said before we should have economic zones, it\u2019s not as if no one has ever said before we need incentives and taxes etc., etc. And Baltimore received a lot of federal aid over the years. So I guess the question, then, is what\u2019s different specifically about your approach to these issues from what\u2019s been tried in the past, because a lot of effort has been put in just the direction you just described. TRUMP: I think what\u2019s different is we have a very divided country. And whether we like it or not, it\u2019s divided as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it. I\u2018ve been, you know, I\u2019ve been doing things for a long time. I see it all the time. I mean I see it so often. I see it when we go out and we have 21,000 people in Phoenix, Arizona, the other day, the division \u2013 not so much Phoenix, because that was actually very smooth, there wasn\u2019t even a minor, they did block a road, but after that, that was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, when the road was unblocked everyone left and it was fine. But in Tucson, you can see the division. You can see the division. There\u2019s a racial division that\u2019s incredible actually in the country. I think it\u2019s as bad, I mean you have to say it\u2019s as bad or almost as bad as it\u2019s ever been. And there\u2019s a lack of spirit. And one thing I thought that would happen, and it hasn\u2019t happened, unfortunately, I thought that President Obama would be a great cheerleader for the country. And it just hasn\u2019t happened. I mean we can say it has. But it hasn\u2019t happened. When you look at the Ferguson problems and the Baltimore problems and the Detroit problems. And you know there\u2019s a lack of spirit. I actually think I\u2019d be a great cheerleader \u2013 beyond other things, the other things that I\u2019d do \u2013 I actually think I\u2019d be a great cheerleader for the country. Because a lot of people feel it\u2019s a hopeless situation. A lot of people in the inner cities they feel that way. And you have to start by giving them hope and giving them spirit and that has not taken place. Just has not taken place. RYAN: Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve mentioned many times during the campaign, in fact including this morning, instances you feel where the press has been biased or unfair or outright false in their reporting, and you\u2019ve mentioned that you want to \u201copen up\u201d the libel laws. You\u2019ve said that several times. TRUMP: I might not have to, based on Gawker. Right? [CROSSTALK] TRUMP: That was an amazing\u2014 RYAN: My question is not so much why you feel they should be open but how. What presidential powers and executive actions would you take to open up the libel laws? TRUMP: Okay, look, I\u2019ve had stories written about me \u2013 by your newspaper and by others \u2013 that are so false, that are written with such hatred \u2013 I\u2019m not a bad person. I\u2019m just doing my thing \u2013 I\u2019m, you know, running, I want to do something that\u2019s good. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do. I had a nice life until I did this, you know. This is a very difficult thing to do. In fact I\u2019ve always heard that if you\u2019re a very successful person you can\u2019t run for office. And I can understand that. You\u2019ll do a hundred deals, and you\u2019ll do one bad one or two bad ones \u2014 that\u2019s all they read about are the bad ones. They don\u2019t read about the one hundred and fifty great ones that you had. And even some of the ones they write that are good, they make them sound bad. You know, so I\u2019ve always heard that. I\u2019ve heard that if you\u2019re successful \u2013 very successful \u2013 you just can\u2019t run for\u2014 RYAN: But how would you fix that? You\u2019ve said that you would open up the libel laws. TRUMP: What I would do, what I would do is I\u2019d \u2013 well right now the libel laws, I mean I must tell you that the Hulk Hogan thing was a tremendous shock to me because \u2013 not only the amount and the fact that he had the victory \u2014 because for the most part I think libel laws almost don\u2019t exist in this country, you know, based on, based on everything I\u2019ve seen and watched and everything else, and I just think that if a paper writes something wrong \u2014 media, when I say paper I\u2019m talking about media. I think that they can do a retraction if they\u2019re wrong. They should at least try to get it right. And if they don\u2019t do a retraction, they should, they should you know have a form of a trial. I don\u2019t want to impede free press, by the way. The last thing I would want to do is that. But I mean I can only speak for \u2013 I probably get more \u2013 do I, I mean, you would know, do I get more publicity than any human being on the earth? Okay? I mean, [Editor\u2019s note: Trump points at Ruth Marcus] she kills me, this one \u2013 that\u2019s okay, nice woman.  Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has said several times he would \"loosen up\" libel laws. Listen to his response when The Washington Post editorial board asked him how, exactly, he would change them, which includes discussion of violence against protesters. (Gillian Brockell,James Downie/The Washington Post)  RYAN: Would you expand, for example, prior restraints against publications? TRUMP: No, I would just say this. All I want is fairness. So unfair. I have stories and you have no recourse, you have no recourse whatsoever because the laws are really impotent. MARCUS: So in a better world would you be able to sue me? TRUMP: In a better world \u2014 no \u2014 in a better world I would be able to get a retraction or a correction. Not even a retraction, a correction. RYAN: Well, now, you\u2019ve been a plaintiff in libel suits so you know a little bit of the elements \u2026 TRUMP: I had one basic big libel suit, it was a very bad system, it was New Jersey. I had a great judge, the first one, and I was going to win it. And then I had another good judge, the second one, and then they kept switching judges. And the third one was a bad judge. That\u2019s what happened. But, uh\u2026 RYAN: But there\u2019s standards like malice is required. Would you weaken that? Would you require less than malice for news organizations? TRUMP: I would make it so that when someone writes incorrectly, yeah, I think I would get a little bit away from malice without having to get too totally away. Look, I think many of the stories about me are written badly. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s malice because the people don\u2019t know me. When Charles writes about me or when Ruth writes about me, you know, we\u2019ve never really met. And I get these stories and they\u2019re so angry and I actually say, I actually say, \u201cHow could they write?\u201d \u2013 and many stories I must tell you, many stories are written that with a brief phone call could be corrected before they\u2019re written. Nobody calls me. STEPHEN STROMBERG, EDITORIAL WRITER: How are you defining \u201cincorrect?\u201d It seems like you\u2019re defining it as fairness or your view of fairness rather than accuracy. TRUMP: Fairness, fairness is, you know, part of the word. But you know, I\u2019ve had stories that are written that are absolutely incorrect. I\u2019ll tell you now and the word \u201cintent\u201d, as you know, is an important word, as you know, in libel. I\u2019ll give you an example. Some of the media, not all of it, but some of it, is very, very strong on \u2013 you know I get these massive crowds of people, and we\u2019ll get protesters. And these protesters are honestly, they\u2019re very bad people. In many cases, they\u2019re professionals. Highly trained professionals. And I will rent an arena for 20,000 seats and they will come in \u2013 because there\u2019s really no way \u2013 how you going to be able to tell \u2013 somebody said \u201coh you shouldn\u2019t let \u2018em in\u201d \u2013 how you gonna know, you know? They walk in. [Inaudible] So we had an incident this weekend, which was amazing in Tucson, Arizona where a man, a protestor, wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit, another one dragging an American flag, was walking out of the arena, and an African American man who was a supporter was sitting there listening to the speech and we had to stop because they were so loud \u2013 they\u2019re so loud, these people, I don\u2019t know what they do, they\u2019re trained voices or something. And they\u2019re walking up and you saw it, because it was all over television, and the African American man became incensed I think the guy said something to him like you know what, like \u201cscrew you,\u201d okay? Or worse. I think, because he looked over to him and said something to him and the guy just had it. Now, they were together, these two. The one wearing a Ku Klux Klan, the other dragging a flag or something, but the African American man, who I think was an Air Force person, I just read he had a pretty stellar life so far. And he just became incensed. So when I saw the television yesterday early in the morning I saw the Ku Klux Klan, I saw exactly what happened. By the time it got on to the national shows that was for the most part taken out. They just had this African American smacking, you know, fighting. And it didn\u2019t make sense, you know, why, why. But if you saw it in the morning it made a lot more sense. We don\u2019t condone violence at all but it\u2019s very, very unfair reporting and we, you know\u2026 HIATT: Sorry, when you say we don\u2019t condone violence \u2014 TRUMP: I say that. HIATT: You say that. But you\u2019ve also said, \u201cIn the good old days, he would have been ripped out of his seat so fast, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Isn\u2019t that condoning violence? TRUMP: No, because what I am referring to is, we\u2019ve had some very bad people come in. We had one guy \u2014 and I said it \u2014 he had the voice \u2014 and this was what I was referring to \u2014 and I said, \u201cBoy, I\u2019d like to smash him.\u201d You know, I said that. I\u2019d like to punch him. This guy was unbelievably loud. He had a voice like Pavarotti. I said if I was his manager I would have made a lot of money for him, because he had the best voice. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, how loud he was. And he was a swinger. He was hitting people. He was punching and swinging and screaming \u2014 you couldn\u2019t make \u2014 so you have to stop. You know, there is also something about the First Amendment, but you had to stop. And, so, this one man was very violent and very loud. And when he was being taken out, he walked out like this, with his finger way up, like, \u201cscrew everybody.\u201d And that\u2019s when I made that statement. He was absolutely out \u2014 I mean, he hit people and he screamed and then he was walking out and he\u2019s giving everybody the finger. And they don\u2019t talk about that. See, they don\u2019t talk about that. They say, \u201cDonald, wait a second, Donald, don\u2019t\u201d \u2014 HIATT: But your answer is you condone violence when the guy is really egregious and terrible? TRUMP: No, I condone strong law and order. I\u2019ll tell you what they \u2014 HIATT: Rip him out of his seat, punch him in the face, isn\u2019t that violent? TRUMP: Well he punched other people. HIATT: No, I understand that. TRUMP: Fred, he punched other people. He was punching people. He was \u2014 one guy was, you know, I\u2019d like to say \u2014 JO-ANN ARMAO, ASSOCIATE EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: The Fayetteville protester who was sucker punched \u2014 he didn\u2019t punch anyone \u2014 TRUMP: No. ARMAO: He was being escorted from police, and he was sucker punched. TRUMP: No. When are you talking about? When? ARMAO: In Fayetteville. COREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN MANAGER [to Trump]: North Carolina. TRUMP: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know which one. ARMAO: Yes you do. TRUMP: I don\u2019t know. Because we\u2019ve had so many \u2014 ARMAO: That\u2019s the gentleman you said you were going to look into to see whether or not to pay his legal fees. TRUMP: Oh well that\u2019s a different \u2014 that\u2019s different from the one I\u2019m talking about. This one was about a month ago. This one was before Fayetteville. ARMAO: Well, okay, Fayetteville, do you condone violence in that case \u2014 TRUMP: No I don\u2019t, no I don\u2019t, that\u2019s different \u2014 ARMAO: Where the protester is being walked out \u2014 TRUMP: By the way, that\u2019s different \u2014 ARMAO: But, yet, you explained it that he was giving the finger and so he provoked it, so he got sucker punched. And you are going to possibly pay for his legal expenses. TRUMP: He did give the finger, and \u2014 ARMAO: So that\u2019s okay? TRUMP: Well, a lot of people don\u2019t \u2014 you know, the finger means, \u201cF you.\u201d A lot of people think \u2014 and you have children there, you have a lot of children that go, you know, they go with their parents \u2014 a lot of people think that\u2019s very inappropriate. I mean, you know \u2014 ARMAO: It\u2019s certainly inappropriate. TRUMP: Well, I think it is. ARMAO: But does it \u2014 is it \u2014 does it qualify to \u2014 TRUMP: So do you let him \u2014 ARMAO: \u2014 to punch him in the face? TRUMP: Again I don\u2019t condone it. So do you let him walk out, he\u2019s holding up his finger, telling everybody. Same thing happened, you know, the last one in \u2014 HIATT: I guess the question is, when you then offer to pay the guy\u2019s legal fees, isn\u2019t that \u2014 TRUMP: I didn\u2019t offer \u2014 HIATT: Isn\u2019t that condoning? TRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t offer, Fred \u2014 HIATT: You said you would consider it \u2014 TRUMP: I said I want to look into it. I said I want to look into it. I didn\u2019t say that. HIATT: Isn\u2019t that condoning? TRUMP: No, I don\u2019t think so. HIATT: Doesn\u2019t that convey a message of approval? TRUMP: Don\u2019t think so. LEWANDOWSKI: To be fair, before every event, there is a public service announcement made about \u2014 TRUMP: It\u2019s true. LEWANDOWSKI: \u2014 any potential protesters. That is made to everybody that says \u2014 TRUMP: Strong. LEWANDOWSKI: \u2014 please do not engage these protesters. You know, they may cause a disturbance. Please do your best, let local law enforcement handle this or security at that venue. The problem becomes, with a massive crowd of twenty or thirty or forty thousand people, the resources that are there don\u2019t have the ability to get to all these people in a manner before the crowd reacts, because the agitators are inciting those people. So we are very clear at the onset, that there is a loud public notice that says, \u201cplease do not engage these people, please let them do their job, and let the local law enforcement deal with that.\u201d That\u2019s said at the very front end at every event. TRUMP: Very loud, and it\u2019s repeated over and over. Actually, I guess it\u2019s on tape, but they repeat it over and over. One thing that was interesting this weekend. We had in Phoenix, Arizona, we had an interesting incident. We had people, we had a major highway coming into the arena. It\u2019s not an arena, it\u2019s a huge open space, 60 acres, and it was packed. And we had a major highway coming in, and people \u2014 protesters \u2014 stopped their car in the middle of the highway, chained themselves to their cars, and the cars \u2014 blocked. They were there for a while. A car was not able to move. They were backed up for 20 \u2014 I mean, like, just forever. And, it was terrible. And they were very abusive, screaming, you know, \u201cscrew you, screw you, pigs, pigs\u201d \u2014 meaning to the cops. Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014 now that was his territory. Okay, he\u2019s a tough cookie. Sheriff Joe saw this, he gave them a couple of minutes to move their car \u2014 they didn\u2019t move them \u2014 cut the chains, arrested the people and just moved the cars over. I don\u2019t know how they did it \u2014 just, they were gone in minutes after he came there. Minutes. It was amazing how quick. They actually had chains around their necks. They didn\u2019t even know why they were there. People \u2013 somebody was interviewed, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d They didn\u2019t even know. Nobody ever talks about these people. They say, \u201cOh, Trump had a bad rally,\u201d or something. You know there are two sides to it, and honestly, there is really one side of it \u2013 because you see how bad this was. So what happened is they arrested three people. There were probably a hundred or a hundred-fifty protesters, there were 21,000 people there, there were 150 protesters that were creating havoc. As soon as the three people were arrested, everybody else ran. That was the last we heard, and I made a speech for, you know, a half hour, 45 minutes \u2013 not one person stood up and started screaming at this speech. It was sort of an amazing thing. Now Tucson was different. Different police force, different level of, you know, whatever, and we had numerous interruptions during the speech. You know, I\u2019ll be speaking, I\u2019ll be ready to make a point, and a guy will stand up and start, just screaming. Out of \u2014 from nowhere, for, like, no reason. Not even screaming things that make sense, and often screaming tremendous obscenities. I know [Lewandowski] went in \u2013 he took a lot of heat a couple of days ago in that same rally because he went in to get \u2013 to quiet people down, and they had a couple of signs \u201cF-you\u201d \u2013 it just said \u201cF-you,\u201d meaning the word spelled out, and you have cameras there, you know, it\u2019s on live television, and you have guys holding signs saying \u201cF-you Trump\u201d or just \u201cF-you,\u201d and they had numerous of those \u2013 there were, you know, probably ten of those signs throughout the arena. And he went in to say, please would you move the sign, and the woman in front \u2013 and I saw it \u2013 this guy grabbed the woman in front, okay, he [Lewandowski] hardly touched him \u2013 he took him \u2013 If he touched him at all it was just grabbing the shirt a little bit. But the guy was a real wiseguy. And he was screaming obscenities. He did grab the woman in front and ultimately he was led out by the security guy, who was right behind him. But the reason is that the police were slow to get there. And the point is this: You\u2019re making a speech and you have guys getting up saying, [Editor\u2019s note: Trump says the next few words in a hushed voice] \u201cfuck you,\u201d and the whole place goes, \u201cWhoa,\u201d and it incites the place. They incite the place, because then everyone goes, \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d That\u2019s why they\u2019re all screaming \u201cUSA, USA,\u201d or \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump.\u201d You can have 20,000 people and you can have like two people. Usually \u2013 it\u2019s amazing \u2013 usually it\u2019s one person. I mean, it\u2019s like they stage it. It\u2019s very professional. They have like one person here, one person here, one person. Okay, we\u2019re talking about the media. So, I\u2019ve never seen the media cover it from that angle. It\u2019s always, \u201cTrump had a\u201d \u2014 and here\u2019s the big thing, I mean, honestly, essentially nobody has heard HIATT: But just \u2013 given the Supreme Court rulings on libel \u2014 Sullivan v. New York Times \u2014 how would you change the law? TRUMP: I would just loosen them up. RUTH MARCUS: What does that mean? [Crosstalk] TRUMP: I\u2019d have to get my lawyers in to tell you, but I would loosen them up. I would loosen them up. If The Washington Post writes badly about me \u2013 and they do, they don\u2019t write good \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t think I get \u2013 I read some of the stories coming up here, and I said to my staff, I said, \u201cWhy are we even wasting our time? The hatred is so enormous.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. I mean, I do a good job. I have thousands of employees. I work hard. I\u2019m not looking for bad for our country. I\u2019m a very rational person, I\u2019m a very sane person. I\u2019m not looking for bad. But I read articles by you, and others. And, you know, we\u2019ve never \u2013 we don\u2019t know each other, and the level of hatred is so incredible, I actually said, \u201cWhy am I \u2013 why am I doing this? Why am I even here?\u201d And I don\u2019t expect anything to happen\u2013 RYAN: Would that be the standard then? If there is an article that you feel has hatred, or is bad, would that be the basis for libel? TRUMP: No, if it\u2019s wrong. If it\u2019s wrong. RYAN: Wrong whether there\u2019s malice or not? TRUMP: I mean, The Washington Post never calls me. I never had a call, \u201cWhy \u2013 why did you do this?\u201d or \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d It\u2019s just, you know, like I\u2019m this horrible human being. And I\u2019m not. You know, the one thing we have in common I think we all love the country. Now, maybe we come at it from different sides, but nobody ever calls me. I mean, Bob Costa calls about a political story \u2013 he called because we\u2019re meeting senators in a little while and congressmen, supporters \u2013 but nobody ever calls. RYAN: The reason I keep asking this is because you\u2019ve said three times you\u2019ve said we are going to open up the libel laws and when we ask you what you mean you say hatred, or bad\u2013 TRUMP: I want to make it more fair from the side where I am, because things are said that are libelous, things are said about me that are so egregious and so wrong, and right now according to the libel laws I can do almost nothing about it because I\u2019m a well-known person you know, etc., etc. JACKSON DIEHL, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Back to foreign policy a little bit, can you talk a little bit about what you see as the future of NATO? Should it expand in any way? TRUMP: Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have \u2013 I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, they\u2019re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with \u2014 why are we always the one that\u2019s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I\u2019ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions\u2013 hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are. DIEHL: Hundreds of billions? TRUMP: Billions. Well if you look at Germany, if you look at Saudi Arabia, if you look at Japan, if you look at South Korea \u2014 I mean we spend billions of dollars on Saudi Arabia, and they have nothing but money. And I say, why? Now I would go in and I would structure a much different deal with them, and it would be a much better deal. When you look at the kind of money that our country is losing, we can\u2019t afford to do this. Certainly we can\u2019t afford to do it anymore. DIEHL: About Ukraine, was it right for the United States to impose sanctions on Russia when they invaded Crimea and would you keep those sanctions on them? TRUMP: I think the answer is yes, it was, but I don\u2019t see other people doing much about it. I see us doing things about it, but I don\u2019t see other people doing much about it. DIEHL: And could I ask you about ISIS, speaking of making commitments, because you talked recently about possibly sending 20 or 30,000 troops and\u2014 TRUMP: No I didn\u2019t, oh no no no, okay, I know what you\u2019re saying. There was a question asked to me. I said that the military, the generals have said that 20- to 30,000. They said, would you send troops? I didn\u2019t say send 20,000. I said, well the generals are saying you\u2019d need because they , what would it take to wipe out ISIS, I said pretty much exactly this, I said the generals, the military is saying you would need 20- to 30,000 troops, but I didn\u2019t say that I would send them. DIEHL: If they said that, would you go along with that and send the troops? TRUMP: I find it hard to go along with\u2014I mention that as an example because it\u2019s so much. That\u2019s why I brought that up. But a couple of people have said the same thing as you, where they said did I say that and I said that that\u2019s a number that I heard would be needed. I would find it very, very hard to send that many troops to take care of it. I would say this, I would put tremendous pressure on other countries that are over there to use their troops and I\u2019d give them tremendous air supporters and support , because we have to get rid of ISIS, okay, just so \u2014 we have to get rid of ISIS. I would get other countries to become very much involved. DIEHL: What about China and the South China Sea. What do you think they\u2019re up to and\u2014 TRUMP: I think it\u2019s a terrible situation, I think it\u2019s terrible they have no respect for\u2013 DIEHL: \u2013and what should we do about it? TRUMP: Well look, we have power over China and people don\u2019t realize it. We have trade power over China. I don\u2019t think we are going to start World War III over what they did, it affects other countries certainly a lot more than it affects us. But\u2014and honestly, you know part of\u2014I always say we have to be unpredictable. We\u2019re totally predictable. And predictable is bad. Sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if I do become president, I have these views that are down for the other side to look at, you know. I hate being so open. I hate when they say \u2014 like I said get rid of the oil, keep the oil, different things over the years, when people are saying what would you do with regard to the Middle East, when we left \u2014 We should have never been in Iraq. It was a horr- it was one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. We then got out badly, then after we got out, I said, \u201cKeep the oil. If we don\u2019t keep it Iran\u2019s going to get it.\u201d And it turns out Iran and ISIS basically\u2014 HIATT: How do you keep it without troops, how do you defend the oil? TRUMP: You would\u2026 You would, well for that\u2013 for that, I would circle it. I would defend those areas. HIATT: With U.S. troops? TRUMP: Yeah, I would defend the areas with the oil. And I would have taken out a lot of oil. And, uh, I would have kept it. I mean, I would have kept it, because, look: Iran has the oil, and they\u2019re going to have the oil, well, the stuff they don\u2019t have, because Iran is taking over Iraq as sure as you\u2019re sitting there. And I\u2019ve been very good on this stuff. My prognostications, my predictions have become, have been very accurate, if you look. HIATT: So what do you think China\u2019s aims are in the South China Sea? TRUMP: Well I know China very well, because I deal with China all the time. I\u2019ve done very well. China\u2019s unbelievably ambitious. China is, uh\u2026 I mean, when I deal with China, you know, I have the Bank of America building, I\u2019ve done some great deals with China. I do deals with them all the time on, you know, selling apartments, and, you know, people say \u2018oh that\u2019s not the same thing.\u2019 The level of\u2026 uh, the largest bank in the world, 400 million customers, is a tenant of mine in New York, in Manhattan. The biggest bank in China. The biggest bank in the world. China has got unbelievable ambitions. China feels very invincible. We have rebuilt China. They have drained so much money out of our country that they\u2019ve rebuilt China. Without us, you wouldn\u2019t see the airports and the roadways and the bridges; I mean, the George Washington Bridge is like, that\u2019s like a trinket compared to the bridges that they\u2019ve built in China. We don\u2019t build anymore, and it, you know, we had our day. But China, if you look at what\u2019s going on in China, you know, they go down to seven percent or eight percent and it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. Our GDP is right now zero. Essentially zero. DIEHL: Could you use trade to cause them to retreat in the South China Sea? TRUMP: I think so, yeah. I think so DIEHL: What would you do? TRUMP: We, well, you start making it tougher. They\u2019re selling their products to us for\u2026 you know, with no tax, no nothing. By the way, we can\u2019t deal with them, but they can deal with us. See, we are free trade. The story is, and I have so many people that deal with China \u2013they can easily sell their product here. No tax, no nothing, just \u2018come on, bring it all in, you know, bring in your apples, bring in everything you make\u2019 and no taxes whatsoever, right? If you want to deal with China, it\u2019s just the opposite. You can\u2019t do that. In other words, if you want to, if you\u2019re a manufacturer, you want to go into China? It\u2019s very hard to get your product in, and if you get it in you have to pay a very big tax. HIATT: So, if they occupied what the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, is that something the United States\u2026 TRUMP: Well, I, you know, again, I don\u2019t like to tell you what I\u2019d do, because I don\u2019t want to\u2026 You understand what I\u2019m saying, Fred? If I\u2026 Okay, if I say \u2018Well, we should go in and do this or that or that,\u2019 I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to sort of\u2026 red flag all over it. I do think this: It\u2019s an unbelievable thing that they\u2019ve done, it\u2019s unbelievable aggression, it\u2019s unbelievable lack of respect for this country. HIATT: This theory of unpredictability, I want to push a little bit, I mean \u2013 there are many people who think that North Korea invaded South Korea precisely because Acheson wasn\u2019t clear that we would defend South Korea. So I\u2019m curious, does ambiguity sometimes have dangers? TRUMP: Well I\u2019ll give you, I\u2019ll give you an example. President Obama, when he left Iraq, gave a specific date \u2013 we\u2019re going to be out. I thought that was a terrible thing to do. And the enemy pulled back, because they don\u2019t want die. Despite what you read, you know, they don\u2019t want to die \u2014 and they just pulled back, and after we left, all hell broke out, right? And I\u2019ll give you another example that I think was terrible: when they sent, a few months ago, they sent fifty troops in. You know, fifty elite troops. Now, why do we have to have a news conference to announce that we\u2019re sending fifty troops? So those troops now have targets on their back. And\u2026you shouldn\u2019t do it. We\u2019re so predictable: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we\u2019re sending fifty troops into Iraq or Syria. And these are our elite troops. And they\u2019re going to do this and that and that and this.\u201d And those troops now are being hunted. If you didn\u2019t send them, they wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if you didn\u2019t say that, they wouldn\u2019t know. I mean, there are times when you just can\u2019t be\u2026 You talk too much. We talk too much. I guess they thought that was good politically, to say we\u2019re sending fifty troops? I don\u2019t think it was good. LANE: Can I ask you\u2026Just going back to NATO, because\u2026 TRUMP: Yes. LANE: As you know, the whole theory of NATO from the beginning was to keep the United States involved in the long term in Europe to balance, to promote a balance of power in that region so we wouldn\u2019t have a repeat of World War I and World War 2. And it seems to be like what you\u2019re saying is very similar to what President Obama said to Jeffrey Goldberg, in that we have allies that become free riders. So it seems like there\u2019s some convergence with the president there. What concerns me about both is that to some extent it was always thought to be in our interest that we, yes, we would take some of the burden on, yes, even if the net-net was not 100 percent, even steven, with the Germans. So I\u2019d like to hear you say very specifically, you know, with respect to NATO, what is your ask of these other countries? Right, you\u2019ve painted it in very broad terms, but do you have a percent of GDP that they should be spending on defense? Tell me more. Because it\u2019s not that you want to pull the U.S. out. TRUMP: No, I don\u2019t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We\u2019re not a rich country. We\u2019re borrowing, we\u2019re borrowing all of this money. We\u2019re borrowing money from China, which is a sort of an amazing situation. But things are a much different thing. NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, we\u2019re protecting Europe but we\u2019re spending a lot of money. Number 1, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved. And I think we bear the, you know, not only financially, we bear the biggest brunt of it. Obama has been stronger on the Ukraine than all the other countries put together, and those other countries right next door to the Ukraine. And I just say we have, I\u2019m not even knocking it, I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, we\u2019re not treated fair. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re treated fair, Charles, anywhere. If you look everything we have. You know, South Korea is very rich. Great industrial country. And yet we\u2019re not reimbursed fairly for what we do. We\u2019re constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other. We\u2019re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing. LANE: You know, well, they say and I think this is on public record, it\u2019s basically 50 percent of the non-personnel cost is paid by South Korea and Japan. TRUMP: 50 percent? LANE: Yeah. TRUMP: Why isn\u2019t it 100 percent? HIATT: Well I guess the question is, does the United States gain anything by having bases? TRUMP: Personally I don\u2019t think so. I personally don\u2019t think so. Look. I have great relationships with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea. But that\u2019s a wealthy country. They make the ships, they make the televisions, they make the air conditioning. They make tremendous amounts of products. It\u2019s a huge, it\u2019s a massive industrial complex country. And \u2014 HIATT: So you don\u2019t think the US gains from being the force that sort of that helps keep the peace in the Pacific? TRUMP: I think that we are not in the position that we used to be. I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we\u2019re a poor country now. We\u2019re a debtor nation. How you going to get rid \u2013 let me ask you \u2013 how are you going get rid of $21 trillion in debt? You\u2019re going to be at 21 trillion in a matter of minutes because of that new omnibus budget. So they passed that ridiculous omnibus budget. How you going to get rid of that debt. We\u2019re spending that to protect other countries. We\u2019re not spending it on ourselves. Because we have, we have armor-plated vehicles that are obsolete. The best ones are given to the enemy. We give them to our allies over in the Middle East. A bullet shot in the air and they immediately run and the enemy takes over. I have a friend whose son is in his third, his third tour over in Iraq. He\u2019s over in, I mean he\u2019s a very special kid, he\u2019s a great kid. But he\u2019s over in the Middle East, and, uh, Afghanistan, different parts of the Middle East, actually. And he said to me, I said to him what do you think. And he said, it\u2019s so sad. He said the enemy has our equipment \u2013 the new version \u2014 and we have all the old version, and the enemy has our equipment, because they get into a fight with the so-called people like the Freedom Fighters, you know the whole Syrian deal, where we\u2019re sending billions and billions of dollars worth, and they capture the equipment. In most cases the shots are fired and everybody leaves. And these are the people we\u2019re backing. And we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be another Saddam Hussein deal, in other words, let\u2019s get rid of Assad with these people and these people end up being worse. Okay? But he said, they have better equipment. It\u2019s our equipment. They have, I guess we send 2,300 Humvees over, all armor-plated. So we have wounded warriors, with no legs, with no arms, because they were driving in stuff without the armor. And the enemy has most of the new ones we sent over that they captured. And he said, it\u2019s so discouraging when they see that the enemy has better equipment than we have \u2013 and it\u2019s our equipment. HIATT: I\u2019d like to come back to the campaign. You said a few weeks ago after a family in Chicago gave some money to a PAC opposing you, you said, \u201cThey better watch out. They have a lot to hide.\u201d What should they watch out for? TRUMP: Look, they are spending vicious \u2026 I don\u2019t even know these people. Those Ricketts. I actually said they ought to focus on the Chicago Cubs and, you know, stop playing around. They spent millions of dollars fighting me in Florida. And out of 68 counties, I won 66. I won by 20 points, almost 20 points. Against, everybody thought he was a popular sitting senator. I had $38 million dollars spent on me in Florida over a short period of time. $38 million. And, you know, the Ricketts, I don\u2019t even know these people. HIATT: So, what does it mean, \u201cThey better watch out\u201d? TRUMP: Well, it means that I\u2019ll start spending on them. I\u2019ll start taking ads telling them all what a rotten job they\u2019re doing with the Chicago Cubs. I mean, they are spending on me. I mean, so am I allowed to say that? I\u2019ll start doing ads about their baseball team. That it\u2019s not properly run or that they haven\u2019t done a good job in the brokerage business lately. RYAN: Would you do that while you are president? TRUMP: No, not while I am president. No, not while I\u2019m president. That is two phases. Right now, look, you know, I went to a great school, I was a good student and all. I am an intelligent person. My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at MIT for 35 years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else. Dr. John Trump, a great guy. I\u2019m an intelligent person. I understand what is going on. Right now, I had 17 people who started out. They are almost all gone. If I were going to do that in a different fashion I think I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. You would be interviewing somebody else. But it is hard to act presidential when you are being \u2026 I mean, actually I think it is presidential because it is winning. And winning is a pretty good thing for this country because we don\u2019t win any more. And I say it all the time. We do not win any more. This country doesn\u2019t win. We don\u2019t win with trade. We don\u2019t win with \u2026 We can\u2019t even beat ISIS. And by the way, just to answer the rest of that question, I would knock the hell out of ISIS in some form. I would rather not do it with our troops, you understand that. Very important. Because I think saying that is very important because I was against the war in Iraq, although they found a clip talking to Howard Stern, I said, \u201cWell\u2026\u201d It was very unenthusiastic. Before they want in, I was totally against the war. I was against it for years. I actually had a delegation sent from the White House to talk to me because I guess I get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I was just against the war. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it did. But we have to knock out ISIS. We are living like in medieval times. Who ever heard of the heads chopped off? HIATT: Just back to the campaign. You are smart and you went to a good school. Yet you are up there and talking about your hands and the size of private \u2026 TRUMP: No \u2026 HIATT: \u2026 your private parts. TRUMP: No, no. No, no. I am not doing that. HIATT: Do you regret having engaged in that? TRUMP: No, I had to do it. Look, this guy. Here\u2019s my hands. Now I have my hands, I hear, on the New Yorker, a picture of my hands. MARCUS: You\u2019re on the cover. TRUMP: A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. They\u2019re fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, \u201cOh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means.\u201d This was not me. This was Rubio that said, \u201cHe has small hands and you know what that means.\u201d Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later \u2026 and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, \u201cMr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have good-sized hands.\u201d And then another one would say, \u201cYou have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cI thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands.\u201d I had fifty people \u2026 Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, \u201cHow are Mr. Trump\u2019s hands?\u201d My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, \u201cOh, your hands are very nice. They are normal.\u201d So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say \u2026 now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn\u2019t work out. Obviously, it didn\u2019t work too well. But one of the things he said was \u201cHe has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else.\u201d You can look it up. I didn\u2019t say it. MARCUS: You chose to raise it \u2026 TRUMP: No, I chose to respond. MARUS: You chose to respond. TRUMP: I had no choice. MARCUS: You chose to raise it during a debate. Can you explain why you had no choice? TRUMP: I don\u2019t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I\u2019m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me \u2026 every time I\u2019d shake people\u2019s hand, \u201cOh, you have nice hands.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions \u2026 I even held up my hands, and said, \u201cLook, take a look at that hand.\u201d MARCUS: You told us in the debate \u2026. TRUMP: And by saying that, I solved the problem. Nobody questions. Everyone held my hand. I said look. Take a look at that hand. MARCUS: You told us in the debate that you guaranteed there was not another problem. Was that presidential? And why did you decide to do that? TRUMP: I don\u2019t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, \u2018Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the\u2013 a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I can\u2019t tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when I\u2019ve got a big audience. So yeah, I think it\u2019s not a question of presidential \u2026 MARCUS: He said he regrets \u2026 HIATT: Okay, let\u2019s move on here. Let\u2019s move on. TRUMP: I did feel I should respond. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. But I felt I should respond because everybody was talking about it. RYAN: You [MUFFLED] mentioned a few minutes earlier here that you would knock ISIS. You\u2019ve mentioned it many times. You\u2019ve also mentioned the risk of putting American troop in a danger area. If you could substantially reduce the risk of harm to ground troops, would you use a battlefield nuclear weapon to take out ISIS? TRUMP: I don\u2019t want to use, I don\u2019t want to start the process of nuclear. Remember the one thing that everybody has said, I\u2019m a counterpuncher. Rubio hit me. Bush hit me. When I said low energy, he\u2019s a low-energy individual, he hit me first. I spent, by the way he spent 18 million dollars\u2019 worth of negative ads on me. That\u2019s putting [MUFFLED]\u2026 RYAN: This is about ISIS. You would not use a tactical nuclear weapon against ISIS? [CROSSTALK] TRUMP: I\u2019ll tell you one thing, this is a very good looking group of people here. Could I just go around so I know who the hell I\u2019m talking to? HIATT: Sure, then I\u2019d like to let a couple of them get in questions. LEWANDOWSKI: We have got five minutes, hard out. HIATT: Okay. TRUMP: Oh is it? CORY: Yeah. You have a meeting you have to get to. TRUMP: Okay we do. ARMAO: I\u2019m Jo-Ann Armao. I cover D.C. events. I want to ask you a question about what you think about D.C. voting rights or statehood. TRUMP: Okay. I\u2019ll talk about that. TOM TOLES, EDITORIAL CARTOONIST: Tom Toles. TRUMP: Hi, Tom. LANE: I\u2019m Charles \u2026 TRUMP: Yes, I know Charles. STROMBERG: Steve Stromberg, editorial writer. TRUMP: Right. MARCUS: Ruth Marcus. TRUMP: Right. RYAN: Fred Ryan. TRUMP: Right, right. DIEHL: Jackson Diehl. TRUMP: Good. JAMES DOWNIE: James Downie, digital opinions editor. TRUMP: Hi, James. MICHAEL LARABEE: Mike Larabee, I\u2019m the op-ed editor. TRUMP: Yes. CHRISTINE EMBA: Christine Emba. TRUMP: Hi, Christine. JAMIE RILEY: Jamie Riley, letters and local opinions. TRUMP: Good, yes, yes. KAREN ATTIAH: Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor. HIATT: Karen, you want to get a question in? ATTIAH: Uh, yeah, I mean speaking again of the system of what a lot of people would say are some of the uglier components of your campaign; a lot of people have said you\u2019ve been running a very divisive campaign as far as racial divides, you\u2019ve noted you know your comments about Muslims, about Mexicans, immigrants and such. You have information that the country is becoming browner, is becoming younger, is becoming blacker. What in your vision of president, in your presidency, how would you bridge these divides and how will you address a\u2013 how are you going to run on a message of inclusion of all Americans? TRUMP: Well, first of all, if you look at some polls that have come out, I\u2019m doing very well with African Americans. I\u2019m doing, actually if you look at the polls, a lot of the polls that came out, in the, um, what do they call it? Exit polls, like from Nevada and other places, I\u2019m doing very well with Hispanics. ATTIAH: I think some of the polls are saying you\u2019re doing [in the] negatives. TRUMP: We do, if it\u2019s illegals, in other words, if it\u2019s everybody, but people that are legally living here, I\u2019m doing very well. In other words, people that are here, like Hispanics that are in the country, I\u2019m doing very well. People that vote. Like people leaving voting booths and all, I\u2019m doing very well with them. I want to be inclusive, but at the same time, people should come here legally. They should be here legally. And I think the reason I\u2019m doing, that I will do well, especially once I get started, don\u2019t forget I haven\u2019t even focused on Hillary yet. And, and as you know, you know I\u2019ve had polls that are against me, but I\u2019ve had many polls that say I\u2019d beat Hillary, but they\u2019re not that, that, they don\u2019t mean anything now because it\u2019s too early. Because I haven\u2019t hit her. I\u2019ve only hit her once, and that was eight weeks ago, but, I haven\u2019t started on Hillary yet, and when I do I think I\u2019ll be able to make my points. I mean, you know, but, but I think that just to try and answer your question: Uh, I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. Okay. That I can tell you. ATTIAH: But do you feel that your messages, your rhetoric, are dangerous and divisive for this country? How do you feel they\u2019re \u2026. TRUMP: I don\u2019t think so. No, I don\u2019t think so. With the Muslim thing I think it\u2019s a serious problem. I\u2019ve had Muslims call and tell me you\u2019re right with the Muslim thing, I think it\u2019s a serious problem. And it\u2019s a problem that has to be addressed. I mean, there\u2019s tremendous hatred. Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, and he\u2019s living right next to where he grew up. There\u2019s a serious, serious problem with the Muslims and it\u2019s got to be addressed. It\u2019s temporary, and it\u2019s got to be addressed. And you know you may think of it as negative. Many people think it\u2019s very positive. HIATT: How would you identify people to keep them out of this country? TRUMP: Well look, there\u2019s many exceptions. There\u2019s many \u2013 everything, you\u2019re going to go through a process. But we have to be very careful. And I was really referring in particular, you know, to migrations \u2013 Syrians, the whole migration, where we\u2019re going to take in thousands. And I heard in the Democrat debate, I heard 55,000, okay. 55,000. Now they say it\u2019s really ten [thousand], but it\u2019s already 10, and I just don\u2019t think we can take people into this country. You saw what two people did \u2013 the woman and the man, whether she radicalized him or [inaudible] \u2013 but you saw what two people did, and I just don\u2019t think we can take people in when we have no idea who they are, where they come from. There\u2019s no documents, there\u2019s no paper, and we have ISIS looming over our head, and we have tremendous destruction. We lost the World Trade Center, we lost the Pentag \u2013 you know, we had a plane go into the Pentagon, etc. ARMAO: D.C.: You told Chuck Todd last year on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that you love D.C., you love the people, that you want to do what\u2019s best for them. They think what\u2019s best for them is statehood or at the very least voting rights. What is your position on those two things? TRUMP: I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C. I think it\u2019s a tough thing. I don\u2019t have a position on it yet. I would form a position. But I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C. ARMAO: Tough politically? TRUMP: I think it\u2019s just something that I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be inclined to do. I\u2019d like to study it. It\u2019s not a question really \u2013 maybe Chuck didn\u2019t ask me like you\u2019re asking me \u2013 I don\u2019t see statehood for D.C. ARMAO: What about having a vote in the House of Representatives? TRUMP: I think that\u2019s something that would be okay. Having representation would be okay. HIATT: Last one: You think climate change is a real thing? Is there human-caused climate change? TRUMP: I think there\u2019s a change in weather. I am not a great believer in man-made climate change. I\u2019m not a great believer. There is certainly a change in weather that goes \u2013 if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s and now they have global warming, although now they don\u2019t know if they have global warming. They call it all sorts of different things; now they\u2019re using \u201cextreme weather\u201d I guess more than any other phrase. I am not \u2013 I know it hurts me with this room, and I know it\u2019s probably a killer with this room \u2013 but I am not a believer. Perhaps there\u2019s a minor effect, but I\u2019m not a big believer in man-made climate change. STROMBERG: Don\u2019t good businessmen hedge against risks, not ignore them? TRUMP: Well I just think we have much bigger risks. I mean I think we have militarily tremendous risks. I think we\u2019re in tremendous peril. I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons. The biggest risk to the world, to me \u2013 I know President Obama thought it was climate change \u2013 to me the biggest risk is nuclear weapons. That\u2019s \u2013 that is climate change. That is a disaster, and we don\u2019t even know where the nuclear weapons are right now. We don\u2019t know who has them. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s trying to get them. The biggest risk for this world and this country is nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons.

Credit Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", "A decade and a half ago, in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, President George W. Bush\u2019s administration conjured up not only terrifying images of nuclear mushroom clouds but also of Saddam Hussein plotting with Osama bin Laden to attack the United States. Mr. Bush himself declared that Mr. Hussein \u201caids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaeda\u201d while Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld called links between Iraq and Al Qaeda \u201caccurate and not debatable.\u201d It wasn\u2019t true, of course. But it helped make the case for war. That may be why a similar lie is getting trotted out again now, except this time the target is Iraq\u2019s neighbor, Iran. On Oct. 13, in his statement decertifying the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump claimed that Tehran \u201cprovides assistance to Al Qaeda.\u201d The following week, his C.I.A. chief, Mike Pompeo, went further: \u201cIt\u2019s an open secret and not classified information that there have been relationships, there are connections,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said at an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a neoconservative think tank. \u201cThere have been times the Iranians have worked alongside Al Qaeda.\u201d On Nov. 1, the C.I.A. released a new batch of nearly 470,000 files recovered in the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Pakistan. But the agency did more than just release the documents to the public. It provided advance copies to the foundation\u2019s online publication, Long War Journal. (The C.I.A. said it was common practice to distribute declassified documents to the news media and academic organizations on an embargoed basis and that the only agenda in releasing these files was \u201cto enhance public understanding\u201d of Al Qaeda.) Long War Journal homed in on a 19-page document by an unidentified Qaeda official who claimed that the Iranian government had offered \u201cSaudi brothers\u201d in Al Qaeda \u201ceverything they needed,\u201d including money, arms and training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon, \u201cin exchange for striking American interests in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.\u201d Yet the Iranian offer, admitted the official, was never accepted by Al Qaeda \u2014 if such an offer was in fact made. The timing of these latest claims from the president and his C.I.A. chief are hardly coincidental. Tensions in the Middle East are ramping up. America\u2019s chief allies in the region, Saudi Arabia and Israel, are pushing even more aggressively than usual to confront Iran. With the Obama administration gone, they have found a soul mate in the White House. President Trump has staffed his administration with hawks who believe that the road to solving the Middle East\u2019s problems runs through Tehran. Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, has accused Iran of trying to \u201chold the world hostage to its bad behavior.\u201d Defense Secretary James Mattis once described the three biggest threats to American national security as \u201cIran, Iran, Iran.\u201d A former State Department official who worked under Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, told me that the Trump administration is \u201cobsessed\u201d with Iran in the same way that the Reagan administration was obsessed with the Soviet Union. Inside the government, the former official added, \u201cIran, ISIS, Al Qaeda, are all mentioned in the same breath, as a menacing threat.\u201d But Americans aren\u2019t exactly itching for a new war. (A majority, in fact, believes the country would be better off staying in the nuclear deal with Iran.) So how can the Trump administration build a case for a pre-emptive strike? Those claims of a nefarious alliance with Al Qaeda might help. The \u201cbomb Iran\u201d crowd has long pointed to the presence of senior Qaeda officials, including members of the Bin Laden family, inside Iran since late 2001. But Iran is far from being a base or command center for Al Qaeda. In 2001, after hundreds of Qaeda fighters crossed into Iran from Afghanistan fleeing American airstrikes, the Iranians deported most of them back to their countries of origin. In 2003, the Iranians offered to swap Qaeda members held under house arrest for members of Mujahedeen Khalq, a militant group that seeks to overthrow the Iranian government, who are being detained by American forces in Iraq. The relationship between the Salafi Sunnis of Al Qaeda and the Shiite clerics of Iran is \u201cnot one of alliance\u201d but \u201chighly antagonistic\u201d and \u201clargely based on indirect and unpleasant negotiations over the release of detained jihadis and their families, including members of Bin Ladin\u2019s family,\u201d according to a 2012 report by the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The report said that Iran held onto senior Qaeda figures not to protect or assist them but to use them as bargaining chips with the United States and also as a deterrent against Qaeda attacks. When I asked terrorism experts what they made of the alleged Iran-Al Qaeda ties, they were unanimous in their incredulity. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen any evidence of active collaboration,\u201d said Jason Burke, the author of an acclaimed book on Al Qaeda. Ali Soufan, a former F.B.I. agent and the author of the new book \u201cAnatomy of Terror,\u201d dismissed the coverage of the C.I.A.\u2019s documents as an \u201coversimplification of the facts\u201d and a result of \u201cthe Trump administration joining Saudi Arabia\u2019s anti-Iran campaign.\u201d Few would deny that Iran has sponsored groups listed by the United States as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations,\u201d such as Hamas and Hezbollah. But, say the experts, support for Al Qaeda is another matter altogether. As William McCants, a former American government adviser on extremism and author of a recent book on the Islamic State, put it, Iran and Al Qaeda \u201cnever embraced as lovers.\u201d So far, none of the documents newly released by the C.I.A. contains a smoking gun. Have Iranian security forces and members of Al Qaeda had contacts, or done deals? Probably. Are there Qaeda figures still living in Iran? Almost definitely. Does that mean there\u2019s an anti-American alliance between Iran and Al Qaeda? No. Mr. Trump, like Mr. Bush before him, is beating the drum for war in the Middle East. But he needs a pretext for an attack on a sovereign nation that, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, is complying with the terms of the nuclear deal. The American public fell for a false pretext in 2003 \u2014 and it cannot afford to do so again. Saddam Hussein was not allied with Al Qaeda; for all its faults, neither is the Iranian government. As Mr. Bush himself once famously tried, yet failed, to say: \u201cFool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\u201d Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) is the host of Al Jazeera English\u2019s program \u201cUpFront,\u201d a columnist for The Intercept and a contributing editor to New Statesman.", "A version of this op-ed appears in print on November 30, 2017, in The International New York Times."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Americans are pessimistic and broadly anti-incumbent, President Barack Obama's ratings are mediocre, and neither party is exactly surging ahead. In short, the situation looks pretty much the same as it did in January.  Voter sentiment in the year's most closely watched Senate races has barely budged since spring. In the 17 Senate races polled often enough to track, the margin between candidates over the past three months has shifted by an average of about 1.7 percentage points. Only one race, Iowa, saw the leading candidate switch, with state Sen. Joni Ernst (R) edging ahead of U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley (D) after the GOP primary. As FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten noted last Wednesday, there's even less movement in the races that matter most in deciding control of the Senate. In the nine most competitive Senate races -- for this purpose, those in which neither candidate is leading by more than 5 points in the polls -- the average change is less than 1 point, with the overall movement not strongly in favor of either party.  Opinions look equally stable at the national level, with public confidence still low that the country is on the right track and Americans in both parties still expressing broadly anti-incumbent sentiments. Despite the GOP's focus on attacking Obamacare, opinions of the law have seemingly stabilized at about 40 percent approval. \"I think the cake has been baked on the [Affordable Care Act],\" nonpartisan political handicapper Stuart Rothenberg told CNN in April. \"I don't think there are a bunch of people changing their opinions now.\" Opinions of the president also seem to have settled, along starkly partisan lines: The vast majority of Democrats continue to approve of him, while nearly all Republicans disapprove, and independents hang somewhere in the middle. His approval rating remains about as low as it has ever been during his tenure as president. The occasional headlines proclaiming Obama at an all-time low (usually meaning his numbers have dropped a point or two) obscure the fact that his overall job approval has been mired for months in the mid-to-low 40s. His polling average, which fluctuated considerably in earlier years, now looks more like a straight line: That lack of change in Obama's ratings seems unlikely to have much bearing on this November's results. But if the pattern holds, it'll be somewhat unusual for a midterm year: According to Gallup tracking data, the president's approval rating dropped 5 points or more between January and Election Day in six of the past eight midterm years. (The exceptions were Ronald Reagan in 1986, whose ratings remained relatively unchanged, and Bill Clinton in 1998, whose numbers actually recovered somewhat.) Numbers on which party Americans would prefer to send to Congress often vary significantly from pollster to pollster, but the average result has also moved relatively little this year. By this point in 2010, Republicans were already beginning to significantly widen their lead, with an end-of-August Gallup poll giving them a record 10-point advantage. This year's polling, however, has rarely showed one party with an advantage of more than a few points. But Democrats face some challenging factors in November: The younger, more diverse voters who make up their base are less likely to vote in midterms, and the president's party typically loses seats in those elections. Combined with the polling results, that suggests the status quo still holds: The GOP has an edge, but not quite wave-like enthusiasm behind it."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Shares of Greece\u2019s Star Bulk Carriers Corp. , Paragon Shipping Inc. and DryShips Inc., all fell more than 80% last year and now are penny stocks.

Shares were flat at $2.57 on Tuesday. Dry-bulk shipper Global Maritime Investments Cyprus Ltd. filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, saying that too many ships were chasing too little business, and resulting volatility in charter rates left Global Maritime with more debt than it could handle.\\  Write to Erica E.

And with it, \u201ca really good feeling putting your head on the pillow realizing you\u2019ve helped other people.\u201d The experiences of male nurses offer lessons that could help address a problem of our time: how to prepare workers for the fastest-growing jobs, at a time when more than a quarter of adult men are not in the labor force. Only 13 percent of nurses in the United States are men, but that share has grown steadily since 1960, when the number was 2 percent, according to a working paper published in October by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cIt\u2019s not a flood, but it\u2019s a change,\u201d said Abigail Wozniak, an economist at the University of Notre Dame, who wrote the paper with Elizabeth Munnich, an economist at the University of Louisville. The biggest drivers, they found, were the changing economy and expanding gender roles. We talked to a dozen male nurses, with various career paths and specialties, working in the Pacific Northwest, where recruitment efforts have focused on bringing men into nursing. Some were drawn to the caregiving, others to the adrenaline of the work. It\u2019s a reliable, well-paying job at a time when that\u2019s hard to come by, they said, but also one they feel proud of.", "\u201cWhen my wife told her grandfather that I graduated from nursing school, he just laughed.

I guess it was never thought of at the time that there might be a guy in here some day.\u201d   Glenn Fletcher, 49   Operating room nurse; former lumber mill worker  Women have been entering male-dominated fields for decades, but it\u2019s less common for a predominantly female occupation to have a substantial increase in its share of men. Yet the jobs that are shrinking tend to be male ones, and those that are growing are mostly female. Nursing is no paragon of gender equality: Even though men are a minority, they are paid more than women. The stigma against men still runs deep, particularly among older patients and in parts of the country with more traditional gender roles, nurses said. (Several said the movie \u201cMeet the Parents,\u201d in which Ben Stiller played a nurse whose girlfriend\u2019s father wasn\u2019t thrilled about his career, didn\u2019t help.) But for some men, the notion that caregiving jobs are women\u2019s work is outdated. Progressive attitudes about gender roles, as measured by the General Social Survey, were associated with more men who entered nursing, the new paper found. \u201cThis narrative that men can\u2019t provide care in the way that women can is part of that broad cultural narrative that misunderstands what nursing\u2019s about,\u201d said Mr. White, the V.A. hospital student nurse, who is earning his nursing degree at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. \u201cWe need to talk with young people about caring as a gender-neutral idea, but also as something that\u2019s rooted in skills, in expertise.\u201d", "\u201cWhen we notice that our boys are gifted in math and science and they say, \u2018I want to be a doctor when I grow up,\u2019 we could say, \u2018That\u2019s great, you could even be a nurse if you wanted to!\u2019 \u201d   Adam White, 35   Nursing student; former banker", "\u201cYou\u2019re a caregiver, providing quality, dignified care. It\u2019s not you doing it as a male or a female, but just generally as a caregiver.\u201d   Justin Kuunifaa, 41   Family practice nurse; former in-home caregiver  The researchers also found that economic factors have played a role \u2014 a decline in some jobs because of automation, trade and the housing crisis, and a growth in jobs and wages in health care. Nursing is growing much faster than the average occupation, and wages have increased steadily since 1980. The median salary is $68,450, about the same as the median salary for college-educated workers over all. \u201cA lot of those manufacturing jobs and things of that nature just aren\u2019t there anymore,\u201d said David Baca, an emergency department nurse in Medford, Ore. \u201cWe get paid a really livable wage, and I think that is now starting to attract more male nurses.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s a good profession because it\u2019ll always be there. They\u2019ll always need nurses. It can\u2019t be outsourced, it can\u2019t be automated.\u201d   David Baca, 37   Emergency department nurse; former handyman", "\u201cMy mother\u2019s a nurse, but for some reason it had never occurred to me to become a nurse until I had a conversation with another man, who used to be an E.M.T. but became a nurse, and something just clicked.\u201d   Peter Stach, 36   In-home palliative care nurse; former server and bartender  The paper used census data about men who were born in the United States and turned 18 between 1973 and 2013. They found that the increase in male nurses was largely uniform across the country, although black and Hispanic men and those in rural areas were less likely to become nurses. Nursing is a career that both men and women often start later in life, in part because it\u2019s possible to become certified midcareer and without a bachelor\u2019s degree. But as hospitals increasingly require nurses to have a four-year degree, it could become a barrier for men who want to enter the field, the researchers said. \u201cWe learned that workers can take a very long time to settle into occupations, but that is not the traditional path that we think of when we think about training our work force,\u201d Ms. Wozniak said. Male nurses are more likely than females to have worked as emergency medical technicians, military nurses or lab technicians, and to work in acute care in hospitals rather than primary care clinics. Nearly half of nurse anesthetists, one of the highest-paying nursing jobs, are men. In interviews, men said they liked the variety of work: Nurses can be bedside caregivers, surgery assistants, educators, technicians or administrators.", "\u201cForget about the stigma. The pay is great, the opportunities are endless and you end up going home every day knowing that you did something very positive for someone else.\u201d   Jorge Gitler, 50   Oncology nurse manager; former business owner", "\u201cMen desire to be caring, and you get a chance to have a career that allows you to care for people meaningfully.\u201d   Graham Seaton, 41   Hospital infection prevention and neuro-trauma nurse; former retail and nonprofit worker  Several said they felt an advantage in applying for nursing jobs because men are a minority in the field. Hospitals and patients benefit when nurses more closely reflect the patient population, research shows. Sometimes patients prefer a nurse of a certain sex, particularly for procedures like inserting a catheter, nurses said, and some men feel more comfortable talking openly with another man. \u201cI work on this floor with people who just had urology surgery or amputations, and they have told me that when I come in the room and shut the door behind me, they feel more understood and can drop the tough guy attitude,\u201d Mr. White said. Nursing became a woman\u2019s job because women were seen as natural caregivers, said Patricia D\u2019Antonio, a nursing historian at the University of Pennsylvania. But until the second half of the 19th century, men were assigned nursing jobs that required physical strength and bravery, like caring for patients during a dangerous epidemic. That began to change when Florence Nightingale brought a group of female nurses to the Crimean War in 1854. Nursing became such a gendered profession that men were barred from serving in the Army Nurse Corps during the two world wars. Not until the 1960s did the nursing field begin trying to better reflect its patients in terms of both gender and race, Ms. D\u2019Antonio said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a job. You have this sense of purpose, this sense of service, that you\u2019re in this to really help improve people\u2019s lives.\u201d   Jonathan Auld, 44   Clinical nurse leader and nursing Ph.D. student; former elementary school teacher  The Oregon Center for Nursing, a work force development group, began recruiting male and minority prospects to nursing in the early 2000s. It started a marketing campaign \u2014 \u201cAre you man enough to be a nurse?\u201d \u2014 that spread nationwide. Posters showed male nurses carrying a snowboard or wearing a motorcycle jacket. \u201cIt was just rethinking how we describe the work and focusing on the kind of person it takes to be a great nurse,\u201d said Deborah Burton, who founded the center and is now chief nursing officer at Providence St. Joseph Health, a health care system in the West. More recently, efforts to recruit male nurses have focused less on gender and more on the rewards of the career, with the slogan, \u201cDo what you love and you\u2019ll love what you do.\u201d Nurses said they welcomed the change. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing any favors to society by conveying this message that nursing is this super masculine thing,\u201d said Mr. Creviston, a psychiatric nurse practitioner and mental health nursing professor in Portland, Ore. \u201cIf your motive is to bring the right men into the field, show how rewarding it is to hold the hand of a dying person.\u201d More on NYTimes.com"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

SAN FRANCISCO\u2014A yogi and filmmaker who has previously sued two other technology firms on Thursday filed suit against Uber, claiming its founders and investors stole the idea and design of the service from him. Kevin Halpern's suit was filed in San Francisco Superior Court. In it, he says Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stole the idea for a real-time, cellular phone-based car service from his startup, Celluride Wireless, which Halpern founded in 2003. According to the suit, Halpern discussed his ideas with Kalanick and Uber co-founder Garrett Camp beginning in 2006. Two years later Kalanick and Camp presented the ideas at a venture capital conference and Uber launched several months later. All of Halpern's agreements with the founders of Uber were \"oral agreements\" and there were no written non-disclosure agreements or other paperwork, his lawyer, Christopher Dolan said. Instead Halpern has what Dolan termed \"a poor man's copyright\" -- a sealed envelop he mailed himself in 2005 which included information about his idea. That envelope is still sealed and now resides in his safe, Dolan said.", "x Embed VIDEO: THE DAY IN TECH Teen repairs search and rescue robot for police | 1:30 A Texas police department sought the help of a Dallas County teenager after they struggled to get their search and rescue robot up and running.

The popular ride-hailing company has raised $5.9 billion in investment. By some reports it has entered into a new funding round that would send its valuation to $50 billion. \"These claims are completely baseless. We will vigorously defend against them,\" Uber spokeswoman Kristin Carvel said in a statement. Dolan held a news conference on Thursday to announce the suit. Halpern did not attend, but instead posted a video on YouTube about his case, entitled \"Grand Theft Uber.\" The full news conference is also available on YouTube. Halpern has a history of filing lawsuits. One was against entrepreneurs Anu Shukla, and Mitch Liu, who helped found a startup called OfferPal Media. Halpern's 2009 suit claimed they had an agreement to create a product together that Shukla and Liu reneged on. Liu settled for $250,000 in 2012. The suit against Shukla was dismissed in 2013, Halpern's attorney said. He also sued the city of Santa Cruz, Calif. for unlawful arrest after he was arrested for being under the influence of an illegal stimulant, the San Francisco  reported. That suit also was dismissed. Kalanick's attorney, Dolan, is a prominent San Francisco consumer lawyer who has represented several other plaintiffs in various suits against Uber. They include the family of six-year-old Sofia Lu, who police say was killed by an Uber driver on New Year's Eve in 2013. Dolan said he took the case because he considers Uber among the class of \"bad corporate actors.\" On his Facebook page, Halpern described himself as an \"Entrepreneur, Ride Sharing Pioneer, Environmental Filmmaker, Aspiring Yogi, Organic Lover, Chinese & Ayurvedic Medicine Devotee, Essential Oil Disciple.\" CONNECTTWEET 30 LINKEDINEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1bU1qWs"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Carmen Gentile, Jeremiah Bailey-Hoover", "ISTANBUL \u2013 During the course of my career covering conflict, I have witnessed numerous acts of incredible bravery. The ability to race headlong into danger still astonishes me. And I'd say that members of the all-volunteer Syrian Civil Defense are among the gutsiest people I have ever met. Commonly known as the White Helmets, these former lawyers, students and stay-at-home moms rush into active war zones after bombs from Syrian warplanes pulverize yet another building. Armed with nothing but simple tools like crowbars and hand-powered jackhammers, they dig through the rubble in hopes of rescuing victims buried under tons of twisted metal and broken concrete. Since the group's creation in 2013, they've saved thousands, regardless of which side of the conflict those buried may be. More than 700 volunteers have been trained for the risky work. Among the first to sign up for this job, in which one in seven are killed, was Khaled Hajjo.", "A soft-spoken young man from Aleppo, Hajjo doesn't like to brag about his exploits. \"I saw many people killed and displaced by the fighting,\" he says almost matter-of-factly of the horrors he has witnessed in his hometown, which inspired him to join Syrian Civil Defense. Before the war, Hajjo was studying to be a lawyer, a dream he decided to put on hold as long as bombs keep falling. I prodded him for additional details. But Hajjo's more inclined to let his deeds do the talking. At Syrian Civil Defense offices in Istanbul, I'm shown video footage of Hajjo and others pulling victims covered in debris from the dark recesses of collapsed buildings. One of their most incredible saves was that of a 10-day-old baby, rescued after being buried in wreckage for nearly an entire day. In video shot on the phones of bystanders watching the White Helmets dig furiously for the child, his tiny head emerges. At first there is no movement. Then, as the rest of the debris encasing the infant is removed, he unleashes a mighty wail. The White Helmets rejoice; the one holding the newborn has tears in his eyes. \"There is a joy we get from saving someone that can't be described,\" Hajjo says. \"When we do, we go home laughing and happy.\" Currently away from the front lines in Syria, Hajjo is in Istanbul helping train the next generation of volunteers. Working alongside him is James Le Mesurier, a former British infantry officer who started the training center for Syrian Civil Defense. The program \u2013 funded by international donors including the United States \u2013 brings recruits from Syria to Turkey to train under conditions that replicate the daunting obstacles they'll face when they return home and grapple with the real thing.", "\"Quite simply, it is the world's most dangerous job,\" Le Mesurier says. Le Mesurier says Syrian Civil Defense is moving beyond search and rescue and is now helping Syrians in other ways, putting roofs back on schools and providing first aid care to those who can't get to a hospital. The Syrian war will soon enter its fifth year, with no sign of abating. Some of the volunteers, such as 19-year-old Badour Taha, have known nothing else during their formative years. Growing up, all she wanted to do was go to college. But when the bombs started to fall, and volunteers stepped forward to join Syrian Civil Defense, she knew her plans must change. \"I saw the passion in their eyes and hearts when they were rescuing someone and thought, 'This is where I belong,'\" Taha says via Skype from Syria. Her fellow female rescuers agree and say when times are toughest for them, they can always count on Taha to bolster their spirits with her infectious laugh and indomitable spirit. \"It's important to laugh and make jokes,\" she says. \"That's what makes you more courageous.\" Listen to the audio version of this story in the player below: Gentile, who contributes to USA TODAY from Istanbul, is the author of the upcoming book Kissed by the Taliban.

Earlier this week, a jihadi channel on the messaging app Telegram called for attacks against the Games and detailed targets and methods, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. SITE said a message was posted to \"Inspire the Believers!\" saying, \"Lone wolf from anywhere in the world can move to Brazil now.\" The message also suggested using the Games to target the enemies of jihad, including Western athletes, and said it would introduce the hashtag \"#RioLW.\"", "JUST WATCHED Rio boosts surveillance ahead of Olympics Replay MUST WATCH  02:27 Security experts said Brazil has no history of jihadi activity and no established terror networks, making it difficult to pull off a complex attack at the Olympics. However, like many other cities, Rio faces the threat of an individual, or \"lone wolf,\" terrorist and those are the people jihadi social media are hoping to reach.

Tightening security after Nice In the aftermath of the attack in Nice, France, Brazilian authorities said they were reviewing their Olympic security plan, widening perimeters around venues and adding checkpoints and traffic restrictions.", "Brazilian Paratrooper Brigade soldiers will be deployed at the Games, which will have about twice as many security people as the London Games. About 85,000 police, soldiers and firefighters will be on duty for the Games, more than double the number in London four years ago. On Wednesday, more than two weeks before the opening ceremonies, troops appeared on popular beaches, including Copacabana.  The Brazilian government confirmed to CNN that four people were rejected for Olympic accreditation because of suspected links to terrorism, out of 500,000 original applications.  Enrico Canali, spokesperson for Brazil's secretary of special events, a branch of the Justice Ministry, said a search of international databases revealed these four were wanted by police. He declined to identify their nationalities.   A Brazil chapter of ISIS? On July 17, a group calling itself Ansar al-Khilafah Brazil, appeared on Telegram pledging its allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and posting ISIS propaganda in Portuguese, according to SITE.  Earlier in the month, Andrei Rodrigues, security chief for the Olympic Games, said while Brazil was preparing for the worst-case scenario, he was not surprised ISIS was turning to Portuguese-language propaganda ahead of the Games.  \"There's nothing new here. It's a well-known fact that they use information and media to promote their ideas and recruitment,\" he said to CNN in an interview earlier this month.", "An F-5 fighter flies over Rio during a Brazilian Air Force security demonstration before the Games. There are many doubts about the authenticity of those claiming to represent a Brazilian branch of ISIS, including by some jihadists. Intelligence firm Flashpoint had \"not seen any credible evidence substantiating such reports.\"  Flashpoint's analysis describes skepticism from jihadists posting on an ISS-affiliated website, including one reading \"this is strange news as we have never heard of jihadi movements in this region.\"  Gohel said he believes posts about a Brazilian branch of ISIS are concerning but he's confident Brazil is taking it seriously.  \"Their telegram channel is not just producing messages in Arabic or English but also Portuguese, which is the indigenous language to Brazil. But the authorities are monitoring it, \" he said.  Brazilian officials said they are sharing information not just among themselves but with foreign governments. They've even set up an international counterterrorism center, the first of its kind at an Olympics Games, to try to stop whatever threats await Rio 2016.

The schedule difficulty of each given game takes into account the rating of the opponent and the location of the game. This is the same concept that is used in computing the WIN50% conference ratings. In COLLEGE FOOTBALL the W-L records include ALL games, but ONLY games between the 254 TEAMS RATED here are used for RATING and SCHEDULE STRENGTH computations. To make predictions for upcoming games, simply compare the RATINGS of the teams in question and allow an ADDITIONAL 3 points for the home team. Thus, for example, a HOME team with a rating of 92 would be favored by 5 points over a VISITING team having a rating of 90. Or a VISITING team with a rating of 89 would be favored by 7 points over a HOME team having a rating of 79. NOTE: Use whatever home advantage is listed in the output below.  In the example just above, a home edge of 3 was shown for  illustrative purposes. The home edge will vary during the season. Several different home edges are shown, one for each of the several different type of ratings directly over their respective columns. The numbers to the right of a team's schedule strength are its rank of schedule - (in parentheses) - and its record versus teams in these rating's CURRENT top 10 and top 30 respectively. Teams that appear to be tied to two decimal places in a given column are actually different when carried to more decimal places in the computer's internal arithmetic. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The PREDICTOR, is such that the score is the only thing that matters. PREDICTOR is also known as PURE_POINTS, BALLANTINE, RHEINGOLD, WHITE OWL and is a very good PREDICTOR of future games. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GOLDEN_MEAN also utilizes the actual SCORES of the games in a different way but is also completely SCORE BASED and thus should be a good match for the PURE POINTS in terms of predictive accuracy for upcoming games. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The RECENT, is score-based and weights RECENT play more heavily than earlier games. Its effect will become more pronounced the longer a season goes if a given team happens to have an upward or downward trend. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The overall RATING is a synthesis of the three different SCORE-BASED methods, PREDICTOR(PURE_POINTS), GOLDEN_MEAN, and RECENT and thus should be a good predictor in its own right. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ FINAL College Football 2017 through games of 2018 January 8 Monday -

ELO and BLUE are set to be on the same scale  and so are directly comparable and of course the COMBO is set to that same scale.  ELO uses only who the winner and loser was of each game and of course the game location.  So the difference in ELO between winning by 1 and losing by 1 is very large.  BLUE cares only about the score and game location and so in BLUE, the difference between  winning by 1 and losing by 1 is simply only 2 points which would be the same difference  as winning by 20 as compared to winning by 18 ... very small.  BLUE is an acronym which stands for \"BestLinearUnbiasedEstimator\" also known as \"pure-least-squares.\" The ELO and the BLUE and thus the COMBO are all \"unbiased\" in that they consider only results from the season in question. Starting ratings have no bearing at all. Predictions for these ratings are found below at the bottom of the file. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ FINAL College Football 2017 through games of 2018 January 8 Monday -

Tom DeLay (R) violated the Voting Rights Act, according to a previously undisclosed memo obtained by The Washington Post. But senior officials overruled them and approved the plan.   The memo, unanimously endorsed by six lawyers and two analysts in the department's voting section, said the redistricting plan illegally diluted black and Hispanic voting power in two congressional districts. It also said the plan eliminated several other districts in which minorities had a substantial, though not necessarily decisive, influence in elections.   \"The State of Texas has not met its burden in showing that the proposed congressional redistricting plan does not have a discriminatory effect,\" the memo concluded.   The memo also found that Republican lawmakers and state officials who helped craft the proposal were aware it posed a high risk of being ruled discriminatory compared with other options.   But the Texas legislature proceeded with the new map anyway because it would maximize the number of Republican federal lawmakers in the state, the memo said. The redistricting was approved in 2003, and Texas Republicans gained five seats in the U.S. House in the 2004 elections, solidifying GOP control of Congress.   J. Gerald \"Gerry\" Hebert, one of the lawyers representing Texas Democrats who are challenging the redistricting in court, said of the Justice Department's action: \"We always felt that the process . . . wouldn't be corrupt, but it was. . . . The staff didn't see this as a close call or a mixed bag or anything like that. This should have been a very clear-cut case.\"   But Justice Department spokesman Eric W. Holland said the decision to approve the Texas plan was vindicated by a three-judge panel that rejected the Democratic challenge. The case is on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.   \"The court ruled that, in fact, the new congressional plan created a sufficient number of safe minority districts given the demographics of the state and the requirements of the law,\" Holland said. He added that Texas now has three African Americans serving in Congress, up from two before the redistricting.   Texas Republicans also have maintained that the plan did not dilute minority votes and that the number of congressional districts with a majority of racial minorities remained unchanged at 11. The total number of congressional districts, however, grew from 30 to 32.   The 73-page memo, dated Dec. 12, 2003, has been kept under tight wraps for two years. Lawyers who worked on the case were subjected to an unusual gag rule. The memo was provided to The Post by a person connected to the case who is critical of the adopted redistricting map. Such recommendation memos, while not binding, historically carry great weight within the Justice Department.   Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Texas and other states with a history of discriminatory elections are required to submit changes in their voting systems or election maps for approval by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.   The Texas case provides another example of conflict between political appointees and many of the division's career employees. In a separate case, The Post reported last month that a team was overruled when it recommended rejecting a controversial Georgia voter-identification program that was later struck down as unconstitutional by a court.  \u00a9 2005 The Washington Post Company"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

A night that saw City secure its place in the English League Cup final \u2014 setting up the prospect of a first of potentially four trophies for the team this season \u2014 also highlighted a vulnerability in Pep Guardiola's side that has been noticeable since the start of the year. In winning 3-2 at second-tier club Bristol City on Tuesday in the second leg of the semifinals, Man City's run of games without a clean sheet extended to six. A defense that looked so solid from August to December is starting to look frail, conceding goals from the few chances opponents are creating \u2014 just like last season. It has coincided with John Stones' return to the team after 6 1/2 weeks out injured. The ball-playing center back had been widely praised for cutting out his individual errors before his layoff with a hamstring problem, but has been at fault for four of the 10 goals City has conceded in 2018. The absence of a senior left back is also starting to tell. Since Benjamin Mendy got injured in September, midfielder Fabian Delph has filled in as an emergency left back and exceeded expectations. Yet injury has limited Delph to only one start in the six games in 2018, with Danilo \u2014 a right back \u2014 and youngster Oleksandr Zinchenko coming in. That left-back area is City's clear weakness, with Mendy not expected to return until April at the earliest. City has won five of those six games this year \u2014 the only loss being 4-3 at Liverpool in the Premier League \u2014 so its prolific attack has been masking the occasional flaws of the defense. Tougher tests remain for the team, however, particularly with the Champions League resuming next month. \"We lost control,\" Guardiola said after seeing Bristol City come from two goals down to pull level at 2-2 before Kevin De Bruyne's injury-time winner at Ashton Gate sealed a 5-3 aggregate win. With an eye on City's last-16 matchup in the Champions League, Guardiola added: \"Maybe it will be good for us, for the Champions League against Basel, to learn that you have to play for 90 minutes and anything can happen.\" Guardiola's reported interest in Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte, a France under-21 international, shows he is not satisfied with his four current center backs \u2014 Stones, Nicolas Otamendi, Eliaquim Mangala and Vincent Kompany. The first three were bought for a combined cost of about 120 million pounds ($170 million). The injury-prone Kompany, meanwhile, was on the bench on Tuesday after recovering from his latest setback, an undisclosed problem sustained at Newcastle on Dec. 27. But it is becoming increasingly clear that Guardiola can no longer rely on City's club captain, a stalwart in the team since 2008. Despite City's shakiness of late, don't expect Guardiola to waver on his utter commitment to attacking soccer. \"I'm not a coach for the tackles,\" Guardiola said after Manchester City's 4-2 loss at Leicester in December 2016, a remark used by some critics to underline misgivings at his ability to set up a defense. Statistics show otherwise. In Guardiola's seven years managing Barcelona (2008-12) and Bayern Munich (2013-16), his teams had the best defensive records in the league each season. Bayern conceded only 17 goals in Guardiola's final year, a Bundesliga record. This season, City has the third best defensive record in the Premier League, conceding 18 goals in 24 games. Still, there is always the risk of Guardiola's teams being exposed at the back, either because of his goalkeeper or defenders getting caught in possession or by opponents picking them off on rapid counter-attacks. The most striking examples of that are Real Madrid's mauling of Guardiola's Bayern in the Champions League semifinals in 2014 and Liverpool's harrying of City's defense at Anfield this month. Left behind so far this season, City's opponents still have something to cling to. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Also like humans, they are long-lived, slow to develop, intelligent and vocally communicative. (NOAA FISHERIES VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS)   March 26, 2012  As a 42-year-old man born in England, I can expect to live for about another 38 years. In other words, I can no longer claim to be young. I am, without doubt, middle-aged. To some people that is a depressing realization. We are used to dismissing our fifth and sixth decades as a negative chapter in our lives, perhaps even a cause for crisis. But recent scientific findings have shown just how important middle age is for every one of us, and how crucial it has been to the success of our species. Middle age is not just about wrinkles and worry. It is not about getting old. It is an ancient, pivotal episode in the human life span, preprogrammed into us by natural selection, an exceptional characteristic of an exceptional species. Compared with other animals, humans have a very unusual pattern to our lives. We take a very long time to grow up, we are long-lived, and most of us stop reproducing halfway through our life span. A few other species have some elements of this pattern, but only humans have distorted the course of their lives in such a dramatic way. Most of that distortion is caused by the evolution of middle age, which adds two decades that most other animals simply do not get. An important clue that middle age isn\u2019t just the start of a downward spiral is that it does not bear the hallmarks of general, passive decline. Most body systems deteriorate very little during this stage of life. Those that do, deteriorate in ways that are very distinctive, are rarely seen in other species and are often abrupt.  For example, our ability to focus on nearby objects declines in a predictable way: Farsightedness is rare at 35 but universal at 50. Skin elasticity also decreases reliably and often surprisingly abruptly in early middle age. Patterns of fat deposition change in predictable, stereotyped ways. Other systems, notably cognition, barely change.", "In Namibia, Eastern Bushmanland, Tsumkwe, an old !Kung man. The !Kung are San hunter-gatherers. Many modern hunter-gatherers live well beyond age 40. Skeletal remains suggest that our ancestors frequently did the same. (Nigel Pavitt/GETTY IMAGES/AWL IMAGES RM)  Each of these changes can be explained in evolutionary terms. In general, it makes sense to invest in the repair and maintenance only of body systems that deliver an immediate fitness benefit \u2014 that is, those that help to propagate your genes. As people get older, they no longer need spectacular visual acuity or mate-attracting, unblemished skin. Yet they do need their brains, and that is why we still invest heavily in them during middle age.  As for fat \u2014 that wonderfully efficient energy store that saved the lives of many of our hard-pressed ancestors \u2014 its role changes when we are no longer gearing up to produce offspring, especially in women. As the years pass, less fat is stored in depots ready to meet the demands of reproduction \u2014 the breasts, hips and thighs \u2014 or under the skin, where it gives a smooth, youthful appearance. Once our babymaking days are over, fat is stored in larger quantities and also stored more centrally, where it is easiest to carry about. That way, if times get tough we can use it for our own survival, thus freeing up food for our younger relatives. These changes strongly suggest that middle age is a controlled and preprogrammed process not of decline but of development. A crowning achievement When we think of human development, we usually think of the growth of a fetus or the maturation of a child into an adult. Yet the tightly choreographed transition into middle age is a later but equally important stage in which we are each recast into yet another novel form. That form is one of the most remarkable of all: a resilient, healthy, energy-efficient and productive phase of life that has laid the foundations for our species\u2019s success. Indeed, the multiple roles of middle-aged people in human societies are so complex and intertwined, it could be argued that they are the most impressive living things yet produced by natural selection. The claim that middle age evolved faces one obvious objection. For any trait to evolve, natural selection has to act on it generation after generation. Yet we often think of prehistoric life as nasty, brutish and short. Surely too few of our ancestors lived beyond age 40 to allow features of modern-day middle age, such as the deposition of a spare tire around the middle, to have been selected for. This is a misconception. Although average life expectancy may sometimes have been very low, this does not mean that humans rarely reached the age of 40 during the past 100,000 years. Average life expectancy at birth can be a misleading measure; if infant mortality is high, then the average is skewed dramatically downward, even if people who survive to adulthood have a good chance of living a long, healthy life. The evidence from skeletal remains suggests that our ancestors frequently lived well into middle age and beyond. Certainly many modern hunter-gatherers live well beyond 40. The probable existence of lots of prehistoric middle-aged people means that natural selection had plenty to work on. Those with beneficial traits would have been more successful at nurturing their children to reproductive age and helping provide for their grandchildren, and hence would have passed on those traits to their descendants. As a result, modern middle age is the result of millennia of natural selection. Lifelong learning But why did it evolve as it did? In prehistory, and still today, human survival is entirely dependent on skilled gathering of rare, valuable resources. Humans cooperate, plan and innovate so they can extract what they need from their environment, be that roots to eat, hides to wear or rare metals to coat smartphone touch screens. We lead an energy-intensive, communication-driven, information-rich way of life, and it was the evolution of middle age that supported this. For example, hunter-gatherer societies often have complex and difficult techniques for finding and processing food that take a long time to learn. There is evidence that many hunter-gatherers take decades to learn their craft and that their resource-acquiring abilities may not peak until they are older than 40. Gathering sufficient calories is crucial for the success of a human community, especially since young humans take so long to grow up. Indeed, for the early years of life they devour calories without contributing many to the group themselves. Research suggests that a human child requires resources to be provided by multiple adults, almost certainly more than two young parents. For example, a recent study of two groups of South American hunter-gatherers suggested that each couple required the help of an additional 1.3 non-reproducing adults to provide for their children. Thus, middle-aged people may be seen as an essential human innovation, an elite caste of skilled, experienced super-providers on which the rest of us depend. Culture conveyers The other key role of middle age is the propagation of information. All animals inherit a great deal of information in their genes; some also learn more as they grow up. Humans have taken this second form of information transfer to a new level. We are born knowing and being able to do almost nothing. Each of us depends on a continuous infusion of skills, knowledge and customs, collectively known as culture, if we are to survive. And the main route by which culture is transferred is by middle-aged people showing and telling their children \u2014 as well as the young adults with whom they hunt and gather \u2014 what to do. These two roles of middle-aged humans \u2014 as super-providers and master culture-conveyers \u2014 continue today. In offices, on construction sites and on sports fields around the world, we see middle-aged people advising and guiding younger adults and sometimes even ordering them about. Middle-aged people can do more, they earn more and, in short, they run the world. This has left its mark on the human brain. As might be expected of people propagating complex skills, middle-aged people exhibit no dramatic cognitive deterioration. Changes do occur in our thinking abilities, but they are subtle. For example, response speeds slow down over the course of adulthood. However, speed isn\u2019t everything, and it is still debated whether other abilities deteriorate at all. To carry out their roles in society, middle-aged people need not necessarily think better than younger adults, but they may have to think differently. Indeed, functional brain imaging studies suggest that they sometimes use different brain regions than young people when performing the same tasks, raising the possibility that the nature of thought itself changes as we get older. An elite club A central and related feature of middle age is the many healthy years we enjoy after we have stopped reproducing. Female humans are especially unusual animals because they become infertile halfway through their lives, but male humans often also effectively \u201cself-sterilize\u201d by remaining with their post-menopausal partners. Almost no other species does this. The possible benefits of menopause are not immediately obvious: After all, natural selection favors individuals who rear the most offspring. Yet there are other, rare examples of reproductive cessation in the animal kingdom that may provide some clues. Orcas also undergo menopause, and it is striking how much their lives mirror ours. They are long-lived, slow to develop, intelligent and vocally communicative. They invent and apply a complex array of techniques for communal food acquisition, and they are extremely widespread.  Thus, humans can be seen as members of an elite club of species in which adulthood has become so long and complicated that it can no longer all be given over to breeding. Just like farsightedness and inelastic skin, menopause now appears to be a coordinated, controlled process. It liberates women and their partners from the unremitting demands of producing children and gives them time to do what middle-aged people do best: live long and pamper.

Research shows that the grogginess we experience following the time change may lead to an increased risk of car accidents, and a 2016 study also found DST prompts harsher legal sentences from judges compared to sentences awarded on other days of the year. This likely can be attributed to sleep loss as well, not to mention the other risks of getting fewer Zs, like a compromised immune system and lower productivity.

On March 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin officially ordered his military to begin withdrawing ground troops from Syria. In a meeting with his top advisers in Moscow, Putin formally declared that \u2014 having succeeded in \u201cradically\u201d changing the situation on the ground in Syria \u2014 \u201cthe main part\u201d of the Russian military contingent there would be pulled back. To hear Putin tell it, the move is intended to spur a cessation of hostilities in the long-running conflict. \u201cI hope that this will considerably increase the level of trust between all parties of the Syrian settlement and will contribute to a peaceful resolution of the Syrian issue,\u201d the Russian president said in televised comments. The real motivations behind the Kremlin\u2019s withdrawal, however, are likely more strategic. And Russia\u2019s most recent maneuver should not be construed as an end to Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria \u2014 or of its imperial ambitions. Indeed, Russian history is replete with examples of a persistent expansionist impulse. From the time of Catherine the Great, Russian leaders have pursued a consistent foreign policy blueprint, building up their military and establishing control over areas like the Crimea, Ukraine and the Caucasus. And historically, Russia has sought to parlay this dominance in the Black Sea region into a foothold in the Mediterranean. The same is true today. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia has consistently sought to expand westward, and to exploit regional conflicts to establish a political (and strategic) presence in its former holdings and satellites. The results speak for themselves. The Kremlin now has troops stationed in the separatist Moldovan enclave of Transnistria. It has installed Iskander ballistic missiles and positioned more than 10,000 troops in Kaliningrad in a bid to pressure the Baltic States. It has recognized, and subsequently sustained, the \u201cindependent\u201d regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in neighboring Georgia. And, most recently, it encouraged a stage-managed referendum that gave it the pretext to annex Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula.", "There, through the subsequent seizure of naval bases in Bakhchisaray and Novoozerne, as well as the Novofedorivka airbase, Russia has succeeded in substantially expanding its military presence in the Black Sea. Now, Russia has launched a substantial upgrade of its Black Sea Fleet, greatly expanding its strategic capabilities there. These steps, together with the deployment of mobile ballistic missile systems onto the Crimean Peninsula, has allowed Moscow to establish what U.S. Air Force General Phillip Breedlove has termed a Russian \u201canti-access/area-denial\u201d strategy for the Black Sea. Now, Russia is moving into the Mediterranean. The Kremlin recently signed an agreement with Cyprus allowing its ships access to Cypriot ports. It has also begun building or updating four separate naval and air bases on the Mediterranean coast as part of its entry into the Syrian conflict.", "Moscow\u2019s footprint in Syria, meanwhile, has grown exponentially. Since its entry into the Syrian civil war back in September, the Russian government has spent millions of dollars on massive air, artillery and intelligence support intended to preserve the regime of Bashar al-Assad. But it has also done much more under the guise of countering the terrorists of the Islamic State. Russia\u2019s naval presence at the key base of Tartus, for example, has swelled from a small shipping facility to a powerful operating base with 1,700 personnel. Its airbase at Latakia has undergone a major upgrade. As of early February, Russia was carrying out roughly 60 sorties a day against assorted opponents of the Assad regime. This activity needs to be understood in its proper context: not as temporary aid to a struggling ally, but as part of a larger, sustained strategy by Russia to expand its strategic presence in the Mediterranean. Russia\u2019s activism, moreover, has continued despite the increasingly dire state of the country\u2019s economy, which has been ravaged by low world oil prices and Western sanctions alike. There is still much that needs to be done to end the Syrian civil war that has raged for half a decade, but a cessation of hostilities is not among Russia\u2019s chief goals. Protecting its military assets and political influence along the Mediterranean Coast, by contrast, are. That is why Russia plans to keep an active airbase and an undeclared number of forces in Syria. By doing so, Moscow will maintain the ability to ramp up its involvement there again if it deems necessary. Russia, in other words, isn\u2019t going anywhere.

VPC", "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama said Thursday he's building a \"broader regional strategy\" against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. But that strategy in Syria is not in place yet, Obama said, and he explicitly tamped down expectations that there would be an imminent military response in Syria, saying news reports had gotten ahead of military assessments. \"Rooting out a cancer like ISIL will not be quick or easy, but I'm confident that we can and we will,\" he said. Obama said he would send Secretary of State John Kerry to the region to build a coalition of \"strong regional partners.\" \"I don't want to put the cart before the horse. We don't have a strategy yet,\" he said. \"The suggestion, I guess, has been that we'll start moving forward imminently, and somehow Congress, still out of town, is gonna be left in the dark. Obama said there would be plenty of time for Congress to review the strategy when it gets back from its summer recess on Sept. 8. \"We're going to cobble together the kind of coalition that we need for a long-term strategy as soon as we are able to fit together the military, political and economic components of that strategy. There will be a military aspect to that,\" Obama said. \"And it's going to be important for Congress to know what that is, in part because it may cost some money.\" On Capitol Hill, Republicans said that strategy needs to come quickly. \"If the President is prepared to engage Congress with a strategic plan to protect the U.S. and our allies from ISIL, I believe he will have significant congressional support,\" said Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. \"But don't forget, the threat from ISIL is real and it's growing \u2014 and it is time for President Obama to exercise some leadership in launching a response.\" Obama referred to the Islamic State as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which is one of the three ways officials refer to the group. Obama made a clear distinction between the response to the Islamic State in Iraq, where the United States is trying to encourage a new, more inclusive government to fight the militants, and in Syria, where the United States won't cooperate with the regime of President Bashar Assad. In Iraq, Obama has authorized daily air strikes of Islamic State targets. The U.S. Central Command in Tampa Thursday confirmed five more strikes against militants' vehicles and checkpoints near the Mosul Dam, bringing the total number of air strikes to 106 over three weeks. Obama's remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon came before a meeting of his National Security Council in the White House Situation Room. Obama also ruled out military action in Ukraine, saying economic sanctions are hurting Russia. \"It is not in the cards for us to see a military confrontation between Russia and the United States in this region,\" he said. He said there's no doubt that Russia is responsible for the violence in the former Soviet republic, and would pay a price for that. \"This is not a homegrown indigenous uprising in eastern Ukraine. The separatists are backed, armed and financed by Russia. We've seen deep Russian involvement in everything they've done,\" he said. Obama travels to Estonia and Wales next week for meetings with NATO allies about Ukraine. He also spoke Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the two agreed that additional sanctions are necessary, the White House said. \"Russia is already more isolated than at any time since the end of the Cold War. This ongoing Russian incursion into Ukraine will only bring more costs,\" he said. Follow @gregorykorte on Twitter.

Once a national women\u2019s team doctor for USA Gymnastics and a highly regarded physician at Michigan State University, Nassar is now entering the final days of his sentencing hearing after more than 150 young women \u2015 many of them current or former gymnasts \u2015 accused him of sexual assault and abuse dating as far back as 1997.  Nassar molested his patients by performing internal vaginal and anal \u201ctreatments\u201d that he insisted were medically necessary. As a doctor of physical therapy who specializes in women\u2019s and pelvic health and who coached gymnastics for eight years, I find this case particularly disturbing. And I would not be doing my duty to champion women\u2019s health if I did not speak up to set the record straight about pelvic physical therapy. What Nassar did to these young women is absolutely atrocious and should not be confused with genuine pelvic physical therapy, which, when performed appropriately and correctly by a highly trained specialist, can have a positive impact on a woman\u2019s quality of life, especially regarding maternal and sexual health.  Pelvic physical therapy is used to treat a variety of medical problems, including bowel and bladder leakage and chronic pelvic pain. In my own practice, young women unable to have sexual intercourse for many years due to excruciating pain were completely pain-free after pelvic PT. A young grandmother was finally able to wear white pants while out shopping because pelvic physical therapy fixed her bowel leakage problem. A pregnant mother was finally able to pick up her toddler again without experiencing severe low back pain.  It is my duty to women like these to ensure Nassar\u2019s abuse does not, in addition to all the other damage it has done, prevent others from getting the care they need. It is critically important for women\u2019s health professionals to ensure the horror of the Nassar case does not feed public fear and misconceptions about pelvic PT or stop women who need health care from walking through our doors.  Women\u2019s health and pelvic health physical therapists who are part of the Section on Women\u2019s Health (a component of the American Physical Therapy Association) undergo ongoing specialized education and training in the treatment of abdominal and pelvic issues. The pelvic health conditions these physical therapists treat include urinary incontinence (any involuntary leakage of urine); urgency or frequency of urination; bowel incontinence (any involuntary leakage of stool or gas); sexual dysfunction and painful vaginal penetration (including the inability to have an orgasm, pain with sexual activities and post-coital pain); abdominal and pelvic pain (including low back pain); pregnancy and postpartum issues; constipation; fibromyalgia; and pediatric pelvic health (bed-wetting, constipation and urinary or bowel incontinence). Nassar\u2019s victims have described an environment antithetical to standard pelvic physical therapy practices. In short, there are hundreds of thousands of people, many of them women and girls, whose lives can be immeasurably improved by pelvic physical therapy. It would pile unfairness on top of injustice if the actions of one abusive doctor discouraged others from seeking the treatment they need. The pelvic floor muscles are a significant area of emphasis in pelvic health physical therapy, and they play an important role in continence control, sexual appreciation, core stability and organ support. Pelvic floor dysfunction, or PFD, is a continually underserved area of the medical field. Research suggests pelvic floor dysfunction affects about 23.7 percent of women in the U.S., and PFDs often coexist with history of trauma and abuse. Furthermore, children who have experienced sexual abuse are at a significantly higher risk for post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, suicide, substance abuse and eating disorders, which can also contribute to \u2015 and magnify \u2015 pelvic floor dysfunction in adulthood. Patients often live with tremendous shame and pain, and do not seek help due to the stigma surrounding pelvic floor dysfunction and pelvic PT. As physical therapists, we strive to eliminate these obstacles through education, advocacy and intervention.  Nassar\u2019s victims have described an environment antithetical to standard pelvic physical therapy practices. There was no chaperone, parent or guardian in the room during his \u201ctreatments.\u201d He didn\u2019t use gloves, and one athlete said she was under the influence of a sleeping pill during a \u201ctreatment\u201d session. In many cases, Nassar performed intra-vaginal \u201cexams\u201d on athletes whose injuries had nothing to do with the victim\u2019s pelvic area. As the world learns of this man\u2019s appalling actions, it\u2019s important to clarify what one should expect from genuine pelvic physical therapy treatment.  A pelvic PT exam is not the kind of exam performed in a gynecologist\u2019s office. There are no stirrups or speculum. The setting is much more comfortable and the exam much less invasive. A pelvic physical therapist will often use internal vaginal and rectal examination and treatment techniques \u2015 all of which are evidence-based \u2015 to help assess and correct a woman\u2019s pelvic dysfunction. Clinics emphasize comfort and privacy, and we spend significant time getting to know our patients and their medical history. Most importantly, any pelvic examination and treatment is performed only after thorough patient education, and only with the complete understanding and full consent of that patient. Therapists use gloves and other universal precautions during all exam and treatment procedures. The patient is always in control during pelvic physical therapy and can end the session at any time if they become uncomfortable. Internal exams are almost never performed on a minor, except in rare instances where the patient is older, sexually active or previously had internal examination from another medical practitioner. In these cases, a parent or guardian is always present to give additional consent for treatment.  For women with pelvic floor disorders, it is difficult enough to battle the stigma, shame and guilt often associated with these conditions. The Nassar case risks making it less likely that women who need pelvic physical therapy will seek it out. Those of us who care for and care about the health of women and girls must not allow predators like Nassar to further victimize women by making them fear the very interventions that can improve and enrich their lives.

This applies, in particular, to the designation 'planets'. The word 'planet' originally described 'wanderers' that were known only as moving lights in the sky. Recent discoveries lead us to create a new definition, which we can make using currently available scientific information. RESOLUTION 5A  The IAU therefore resolves that planets and other bodies in our Solar System be defined into three distinct categories in the following way: (1) A planet1 is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. (2) A dwarf planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape2, (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite. (3) All other objects3 orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as \"Small Solar System Bodies\". 1The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 2An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects into either dwarf planet and other categories. 3These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies. IAU Resolution: Pluto RESOLUTION 6A  The IAU further resolves: Pluto is a dwarf planet by the above definition and is recognized as the prototype of a new category of trans-Neptunian objects.

Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images", "Just over 250 million years ago, the planet suffered what may be described as its greatest holocaust: ninety-six percent of marine genera (plural of genus) and seventy percent of land vertebrate vanished for good. Even insects suffered a mass extinction \u2013 the only time before or since. Entire classes of animals \u2013 like trilobites \u2013 went out like a match in the wind.   But what\u2019s arguably most fascinating about this event \u2013 known as the Permian-Triassic extinction or more poetically, the Great Dying \u2013 is the fact that anything survived at all. Life, it seems, is so ridiculously adaptable that not only did thousands of species make it through whatever killed off nearly everything (no one knows for certain though theories abound) but, somehow, after millions of years life even recovered and went on to write new tales.   Even as the Permian-Triassic extinction event shows the fragility of life, it also proves its resilience in the long-term. The lessons of such mass extinctions \u2013 five to date and arguably a sixth happening as I write \u2013 inform science today. Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000 (some even say 10,000) times the background rate, researchers have long worried about our current destruction of biodiversity \u2013 and what that may mean for our future Earth and ourselves.    In 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes, biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it \u201cbiosphere integrity,\u201d but that hasn\u2019t spared it from critique.    A paper last year in Trends in Ecology & Evolution scathingly attacked the idea of any global biodiversity boundary.

The image on the left from March 2016 is the coral after bleaching, the one on the right from May 2016 shows it after it has died and been blanketed by seaweed. Human-caused climate change is wiping out some reefs wholesale and many researchers fear coral reefs may not survive the century.

Montoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that there isn\u2019t evidence of a point at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, globally or even locally. If the planet didn\u2019t collapse after the Permian-Triassic extinction event, it won\u2019t collapse now \u2013 though our descendants may well curse us for the damage we\u2019ve done.  Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden plunge. Ecosystems, according to them, slowly degrade but never fail outright.   \u201cOf more than 600 experiments of biodiversity effects on various functions, none showed a collapse,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cIn general, the loss of species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem functions...We progressively lose pollination services, water quality, plant biomass, and many other important functions as we lose species. But we never observe a critical level of biodiversity over which functions collapse.\u201d   This doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be deeply concerned about biodiversity, according to the researchers. Instead, we should worry about every species lost and not focus on a theoretical line in the sand.  \u201cIt is in fact the planetary boundary argument that implies that there is a lot of biodiversity that has no value. There is no problem with losing a small number of species, the argument goes,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cWe argue that even small losses of biodiversity have important consequences for ecosystem function and service provisioning.\u201d   In other words, extinction of species may not result in a total collapse of our ecosystems \u2013 but the more we lose, the less productive, efficient, and healthy our environment will be. And the more at risk we put ourselves.  Boundary scientists fire back   But, the Stockholm Resilience Centre recently published a long response to Montoya\u2019s paper in the usual way of scientific sparring \u2013 publications going back and forth like boxers exchanging blows.   Johan Rockstr\u00f6m the executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre and one of the leading researchers on planetary boundaries, said that Montoya\u2019s critique didn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny because its authors misunderstood the definitions built around the \u201cbiosphere integrity planetary boundary.\u201d  Rockstr\u00f6m agrees that there is no evidence of a planetary tipping point when it comes to biodiversity. According to Rockstr\u00f6m, biodiversity decline does not have a hard planetary boundary like, say, climate change. Instead he describes biodiversity as a variable that operates \u201cunder the hood of the planetary system\u201d because it influences the stability of our climate, ozone layer and oceans \u2013 all of which Rockstr\u00f6m contends have very clear planetary boundaries.    A TED talk by Johan Rockstr\u00f6m.  \u201cWe have never suggested a planetary scale biodiversity tipping point...\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m said. \u201cInstead, the rational for biodiversity as a planetary boundary is that the composition of trees, plants, microbes in soils, phytoplankton in oceans, top predators in ecosystems\u2026together constitute a fundamental core contributor to regulating the state of the planet.\u201d   According to Rockstr\u00f6m, biodiversity is one of the pillars supporting our planet \u2013 and if too much biodiversity is lost we risk \u201ctriggering a tipping point\u201d in our climate or oceans, which in turn could risk pushing the planet into a new state. \u201cWithout biodiversity, no ecosystems. No ecosystems, no biomes. No biomes, no living regulator of all the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water,\u201d he added.    Rockstr\u00f6m says biodiversity loss could risk the \u201csafe operating space\u201d for humans, leaving us in an alien world increasingly hostile to our own survival. For example, life would still survive under apocalyptic climate change \u2013 but we may not.   While ecosystems may not fully collapse, scientists have found that some ecosystems can undergo what they are called \u201cregime shifts.\u201d Coral reefs, overheated by climate change, will shift to a much less productive, much less biodiverse algae-based ecosystem. Climate change, or alternatively humans with chainsaws and fire, can shift forest ecosystems to grasslands. While none of these ecosystems may wholly collapse, they will look nothing like they did after the shift occurs.  Montoya admits that such regime shifts \u201cdo actually happen\u201d and is \u201cwell established\u201d for some ecosystems \u2013 like forests, coral reefs and Arctic sea ice \u2013 though \u201cunclear\u201d if it happens in all ecosystems or only a few.    And he adds, perhaps most importantly, that \u201cthe mechanisms [of regime shifts] have nothing to do with biodiversity loss.\u201d Instead, they have been driven by climate change or human actions \u2013 such as clear-cutting.   Debating definitions", "It may be that unclear or shifting definitions are at the root of the dispute.    \u201cFatally, the boundaries framework lacks clear definitions, or it has too many conflicting definitions, does not specify units, and fails to define terms operationally, thus prohibiting application by those who set policy,\u201d Montoya, Donohut and Pimm write in the paper.  But Rockstr\u00f6m contends that when understood correctly the planetary boundary framework holds up to scientific scrutiny. He says planetary boundaries do not mean that humanity can just destroy and upend all the way up to a red line without consequences.   \u201cThis is of course just nonsense,\u201d he noted, arguing that the planetary boundary for biosphere integrity is magnitudes more ambitious than the Aichi Targets from the Convention on Biological Diversity, an international agreement set on preserving biodiversity \u2013 though already several goals have not been met.  \u201cIf the world is able to reduce biodiversity loss below the planetary boundary this would not only require major conservation efforts across the world,\u201d he said, adding that \u201conce inside the safe operating space, we would of course have to continue on a sustainable pathway.\u201d                 The Wider Image: Battling deforestation in the Amazon Burning forest is seen during \u201cOperation Green Wave\u201d conducted by agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, to combat illegal logging in Apui, in the southern region of the state of Amazonas, Brazil, August 4, 2017. Photograph: Bruno Kelly/Reuters", "Rockstr\u00f6m said that he believes the disputing researchers have much more in common than their infighting would imply.    \u201cWe are [all] working to safeguard biodiversity for sustainable development. We are [all] in the same camp. Complementing each other, they at the ecosystem level, us at the planetary level.\u201d   But Montoya and his group stand by their criticism and are working on a second paper responding to Rockstr\u00f6m and his team.    While Montoya\u2019s paper does not critique the other eight planetary boundaries in their paper, Montoya told me that each of the boundaries \u2013 even the physical ones \u2013 have faced \u201ca lot of controversy.\u201d   \u201cThey all suffer from the tipping-point problem,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich we argue promotes a business-as-usual ethos and distracts us from taking the action that is urgently needed.\u201d  In many ways one could argue that the planetary boundary is an easy and simple way to explain environmental impacts to world leaders \u2013 few of whom have any education on ecology or the environment \u2013 and the public.   But Montoya argues that the planetary boundaries concept is doing more harm than good.    \u201cPoor or ill-founded science ultimately brings about ineffectual policies at best \u2013 and potentially highly damaging ones \u2013 and erodes trust in scientists,\u201d he said.   And this can have real world impacts: Montoya and colleagues point to forest policy in Europe as one example.    \u201cThe assumption that there is a critical biodiversity level below which forest functioning will collapse prompted managers [to] plant resilient tree species to climate change, pests, and disease,\u201d Montoya explained, adding, \u201cthis was recommended to avoid reaching a tipping point in forest service provisioning, primarily timber production.\u201d But the recommendations have resulted in endangered old growth forests and native species, according to Montoya.

Photograph: Gent Shkullaku/AFP/Getty Images", "While the on-going debate over planetary boundaries is deeply academic and wonky, it is not without importance to the public. How we communicate environmental crises \u2013 and the accuracy of the science that underpins that communication \u2013 proves more important with every passing year, as the world walks into climate and ecological uncertainty.    Yes, life itself survived the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event \u2013 but most species did not. Believe me, humans probably wouldn\u2019t have survived the tens-of-millions of years that followed the Great Dying: oxygen levels were dangerously low, food would have been scarce, and the world would have looked largely barren and wasted even as some species and ecosystems managed to survive. Outside the moral dilemma of extinction, there is no question that if humans push more-and-more species into oblivion there will be impacts on our society \u2013 and they could become catastrophic.   Humans evolved 248 million years later in an Earth that was far more biodiverse and rich, a kind of Eden of abundance and diversity. But our current actions risk all that \u2013 and perhaps ourselves.

It might have also shortened their lives.", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["June 18, 2013  Welfare reform is pretty popular. A Rasmussen poll last July found that 83 percent of American adults favor the work requirement placed on welfare by the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, commonly known as the welfare reform law. In 2002, closer to the bill's enactment, a Pew poll found 46 percent of Americans thought the bill changed the welfare system for the better, and only 17 percent thought it changed things for the worse. Mitt Romney certainly thought it was popular, as he purchased airtime for an ad that (falsely) alleged that President Obama has gutted the law: And some of the numbers seem to suggest this support is justified. The average number of people receiving cash benefits from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the name welfare has gone by since 1996, has fallen from 12.6 million that year to 4.6 million in 2011. \"Caseloads declined by 54 percent. Sixty percent of mothers who left welfare found work, far surpassing predictions of experts,\" President Clinton wrote in a 2006 op-ed in the New York Times. \"Child poverty dropped to 16.2 percent in 2000, the lowest rate since 1979, and in 2000, the percentage of Americans on welfare reached its lowest level in four decades.\" But it's not that simple. Indeed, the health consequences of the change, a new study suggests, are potentially quite large, and quite negative. The Health Affairs study, written by Columbia's Peter Muennig and Zohn Rosen, along with the Wallace Foundation's Elizabeth Ty Wilde, finds that welfare reform increases mortality among recipients, reducing life expectancy by about nine months. They don't look at the 1996 act but at the Florida Family Transition Program, a precursor welfare-to-work program that operated from 1994 to 1999. Helpfully, the program involved a randomized trial. Participants were randomly assigned either to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the program TANF replaced, or to the Family Transition Program, in which they received training, education and job placement services but were limited to either 24 months of cash aid per 60 months, or 36 months cash aid per 72 months; people in the latter group were judged to lack work experience and need more time to prepare to reenter the workforce. The people in the experimental welfare-to-work group were much likelier to obtain employment, but they weren't likely to make more total income than those in AFDC, once you take cash assistance and other forms of income AFDC recipients received into account. Of the 1,611 experiment participants in the county the study focused on, 75 died by November 2011. Of the 1,613 members of the control group, by contrast, 67 died by November 2011. That means the welfare-to-work had 16 percent higher mortality than those receiving normal cash assistance, a result that was highly statistically significant and, because of the study's random design, can be attributed to the different welfare program. That amounts to a nine-month reduction in life expectancy between the ages of 30 and 70. One can't generalize from that to say that national welfare reform cost lives, since the programs are sufficiently different, though it's worth noting that the Florida program was, if anything, less stringent than the federal law. But it would hardly be surprising if the same were true of the 1996 law. As the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities has noted, welfare reform made TANF a much less comprehensive anti-poverty program than AFDC was. In 1979, under AFDC, 82 families were on welfare for every 100 families with children in poverty. When welfare reform was passed in 1996, that had fallen to 68 families per 100. By 2010, it had plummeted to 27 per 100:", "Welfare, for better or worse, simply wasn't supporting poor families as much as it had. That showed up in the poverty numbers. Research from Kathryn Edin at Harvard and Luke Schaefer suggests that extreme poverty \u2014 defined as households living on less than $2 per day per person \u2014 grew greatly after welfare reform's passage. That's not a coincidence. The yellow line shows what extreme poverty would be each year but for AFDC/TANF, and the dark blue line shows the extreme poverty rate taking that and other cash assistance into account. In the 1990s, the distance between the two is great, suggesting that AFDC/TANF kept a lot of folks out of extreme poverty. But by the late 2000s, it had narrowed greatly: It's hardly a big leap to think that increases in extreme poverty could lead to increases in mortality, but other studies on the health effect of welfare reform are mixed. In 2008, UC Davis's Hilary Hoynes and UC Irvine's Marianne Bitler summarized the literature as concluding, \"welfare reform led to reduction in health insurance coverage, with small and often insignificant impacts on health care utilization and health status.\" But there's also literature suggesting that anti-poverty programs improve health outcomes, literature for which Hoynes is largely responsible. Along with Davis's Douglas Miller and David Simon, she found that a $1,000 increase in the earned income tax credit (EITC) is associated with a 6.7 to 10.8 percent reduction in the rate of low birth weight for infants. That's backed up by a study by Notre Dame's Williams Evans and Northwestern's Craig Garthwaite, who found that the expansion of the EITC included in Clinton's 1993 budget reduced the probability of recipient reports of high blood pressure by 3.2 percentage points and the probability of reporting biomarkers that predict stroke, heart attacks and mortality by 9.6 percentage points. Reagan Baughman at the University of New Hampshire found similar results for state EITCs. Same goes for non-EITC programs. Along with Davis's Marianne Page and Ann Huff Stevens, Hoynes found that the aid for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program increases birth weight by between 18 to 29 grams. That's actually lower than other researchers; Bitler and Princeton's Janet Currie found that it increases birth weight by 62 grams. And along with Columbia's Douglas Almond and Northwestern's Diane Schanzenbach, Hoynes found that food stamps increase birth weight by between 15 and 20 grams for whites and between 13 and 42 grams for blacks. None of those are directly relevant to welfare reform per se, but they do suggest that benefit cuts implemented through welfare reform could hurt health outcomes, potentially swamping any gains from increased employment. For her part, Hoynes calls the new mortality study \"potentially very important,\" but emphasizes that the effect may not hold in all states, and that we know very little about why mortality increased. \"What were the causes of death?\" she asks. \"Internal (e.g. heart disease) or external (accident, homicide)? Who was dying? Which age ranges?\" All of that's important for interpreting the results. So it's too soon to conclude that the national law actually cost lives. But if the Florida results hold, it's probably worth taking another look.

Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, said he felt Clinton\u2019s numbers were \u201cquite encouraging\u201d though he did let himself contemplate a Trump presidency about a month ago. \u201cWhile my initial reaction was that it would be a total disaster to have a man with with a fourth grade knowledge of the constitution running the country, Congress would be forced to have a watchful check and balance on this guy. In particular, we\u2019d need to reclaim war-making authority and I suspect many Republicans would join us in doing that,\u201d Himes said. Here\u2019s a fun fact: Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution specifically grants Congress the power to declare war. The Constitution further informs us that once Congress has made a declaration of war, the president has the authority to direct the military.  What does Himes mean by \u201creclaiming?\u201d Well, over the years, Congress has ceded a whole lot of power to the executive branch, including this very important check on war-making. Currently, Congress has granted the president the ability to pursue military engagements (also known as \u201cwar\u201d) under a series of open-ended Authorizations for the Use of Military Force. The real advantage of an AUMF, from the point of view of Congress, is that it gets to take credit for granting the president the ability to go to war when the war is going well, and criticize the president when the war is going poorly. Congress has, in recent years, pondered its forsworn constitutional duty on a couple of occasions. Back in 2011, when President Barack Obama wanted to establish a no-fly zone over Syria, Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) suddenly discovered some zeal for formal war-declaration. As Foreign Policy\u2019s Josh Rogin reported, Lugar maintained that Congress had to \u201cpass a formal declaration of war if the Obama administration decides to take that step.\u201d But more often than not, Congress prefers to simply stretch out existing AUMFs to cover new wars or, failing that, play comical games of hot potato with the responsibility. But according to Himes, Trump would change that calculus. And that is a good thing to hear, believe me. But I would posit that the real problem here isn\u2019t that Congress would have to begrudgingly \u201creclaim\u201d its \u201cwar-making authority\u201d from a hypothetical President Trump. The problem is that it ceded this power to any president in the first damned place. Here\u2019s a suggestion, Congress. If the polling projections hold and Clinton ends up winning the presidency, how about y\u2019all just reclaim that authority anyway?", "The Huffington Post", "~~~~~ Jason Linkins edits \u201cEat The Press\u201d for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast \u201cSo, That Happened.\u201d Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

Wade Was About More Than Abortion", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["A woman waiting in the recovery area after her abortion at a clinic in Alabama. Credit Melissa Golden for The New York Times", "The events planned to mark the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade have one main thing in common: They focus on abortion. In protesting Roe this year, March for Life celebrated a record low abortion rate, proclaiming that \u201clove saves lives.\u201d California lawmakers introduced a resolution last year describing Roe as \u201cthe cornerstone of women\u2019s ability to control their reproductive lives.\u201d But as the nation again considers the legacy of the country\u2019s best-known Supreme Court decision, issued on Jan. 22, 1973, we have mostly forgotten part of the story of Roe v. Wade \u2014 one almost entirely disconnected from abortion. In the 1970s and beyond, Americans used Roe to answer much larger questions: What does the right to privacy mean, and who can claim that right? Because we so often identify Roe with a woman\u2019s right to choose, we forget that the original decision attracted the ire of feminists who believed that the court had focused too little on women\u2019s interests in fertility control. The court held that the right to privacy was broad enough to encompass a woman\u2019s decision, with her doctor, to terminate her pregnancy. The justices also reasoned that the government\u2019s interest in protecting fetal life did not become compelling until the point of viability. But why wield the court\u2019s decision as a weapon for social change? Most scholars agreed that Roe was a poorly reasoned opinion. What was the appeal for grass-roots activists? The answer is that Roe\u2019s definition of privacy seemed different. More than other Supreme Court decisions, it connected privacy to ideas about individual identity and choice. Whatever the flaws of the original decision, many hoped to use it to redefine who was thought to have autonomy and why. Civil libertarians, feminists and supporters of L.G.B.T. rights argued that the right to privacy stated in the abortion decision covered other decisions about sexual intimacy. The American Civil Liberties Union used Roe in defending sex workers, gays and lesbians, porn stars and women cohabiting with their boyfriends. Conservatives as well as liberals invoked this newly articulated right to privacy. With the spread of computers, politicians like Barry Goldwater and his son, the former Republican representative Barry Goldwater Jr., pointed to Roe in demanding privacy protections for personal information. Champions of consumers\u2019 rights read the abortion decision as suggesting that patients could choose any course of treatment, including unproven alternative remedies. Those seeking a right to die used it in the fight for autonomy at the end of life. For more than a decade, Roe appealed to different groups exploring the untapped potential of the right to privacy. People on both the right and the left saw possible connections between privacy and individual interests in conscientious objection, self-determination and equal treatment. So how did one decision 45 years ago become synonymous with abortion and nothing else? In part, other privacy fights fizzled when the coalitions backing new rights collapsed. Feminists and libertarians clashed about the line between sexual coercion and sexual privacy. Those who hoped to expand data privacy disagreed about when the government had a good enough reason to collect personal data. Abortion foes and Republican politicians consciously tried to redefine Roe, equating the decision with abortion and judicial activism. Ronald Reagan had to assure social conservatives that he would pick federal judges who opposed abortion, but he also consistently promised to select nominees based on their accomplishments and judicial philosophy. Labeling Roe an activist decision helped Reagan and other Republicans strike this balance. Abortion opponents initially did not take much interest in arguments about judicial activism, seeing them as a distraction from the fight for an amendment that would ban all abortions. But by the 1980s, it was obvious that a fetal rights amendment would not pass soon. Delegitimizing Roe suddenly seemed an important step toward the movement\u2019s new goal of overruling the 1973 decision. On Roe\u2019s 45th anniversary, we should stop to think about where the right to privacy stands today. The picture does not seem very rosy. Since the new year, there have been fresh concerns about data breaches and the misuse of digital information by giants like Facebook and Google. Privacy and conscience have taken center stage as the Supreme Court considers whether a Christian baker can refuse to serve a same-sex couple. It is easy to believe that the right to privacy is ineffective, more likely to shore up a dissatisfying status quo. But part of Roe\u2019s legacy is the many ways conservatives and liberals once reimagined the right to privacy. Social movements hardly felt constrained by what the Supreme Court had written. Some pointed to privacy not just in asking for freedom from the government but also in demanding financial support from the state. Others asked not just to be left alone behind closed doors but also to get respect for relationships in public. People tried to use the right to privacy to transform attitudes about sexuality, death and the collection of digital data. Americans have rethought the right to privacy before. There is no reason we couldn\u2019t do it again."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "JUST WATCHED The year feminism fought back Replay Story highlights Young women around the country say the #MeToo movement is positively impacting them One hope is that #MeToo will help young women feel more confident and assertive  (CNN) Curious to know if the #MeToo conversation on sexual harassment was resonating with younger girls, I contacted my niece, a junior in high school in Westchester, just outside New York. My niece, Isabel Gurwitch, jotted down some notes so she would be prepared when we talked. What she wrote gets to the heart of how powerful #MeToo could ultimately be for younger women.  Isabel noted how many girls seem to lose confidence during adolescence. In her experience, it begins toward the end of middle school and continues through high school. Boys tend to talk over girls, especially in higher level classes, and girls seem to volunteer less and have a little less academic confidence, she said. Even Isabel admits that when she was in elementary school and in the beginning of middle school, she had no trouble asserting herself. But that changed toward the end of middle school.", "\"It seems like that's the age when girls sort of lose some of that confidence and I don't really know where that comes from,\" said Isabel. \"So I was thinking ... the movement might change that eventually. I don't know,\" she said referring to the new attention on sexual harassment in the workplace. Read More And that is the question I set out to explore: Could #MeToo also be a turning point for younger women and help them become more confident and assertive? Could it lead to girls who aren't reluctant to raise their hands in class and speak up, girls who might never have the need to say #MeToo? Teaching girls to lift each other up  Allegra Dubus-Brandolini is a senior in high school in Exeter, New Hampshire. She said #MeToo has changed her relationship with girls, bringing her and her friends closer.", "\"Our conversations have also changed,\" said Allegra. \"Where once we would spend our time talking about boys we like and drama that is happening to us, the conversation has opened up to discussing what is happening in the world and discussing our future and asking ... what our future will look like in this society. This has allowed us to gain a sense of trust that I don't think we had before.\" She said she has also noticed a \"huge difference\" in relationships with boys. Girls and boys used to feel afraid and ashamed to talk about difficult topics such as rape and consent, but #MeToo has \"broken that barrier and made us feel more comfortable\" discussing these issues, she said.  Boys also seem to be more comfortable asking questions they might have been afraid or reluctant to ask before, Allegra said. Questions such as, what is healthy masculinity? Girls trusting other girls and working together with them, and finding common ground with boys, can be critical steps in helping girls grow to be strong, confident and assertive, said Katie Hurley, a child and adolescent psychotherapist and author. Her newest book, \"No More Mean Girls: The Secret to Raising Strong, Confident and Compassionate Girls,\" will be released later this month.", "Katie Hurley, author of \"No More Mean Girls,\" and her 11-year-old daughter, Riley  \"It feels like we're right there where the tides are about to turn,\" said Hurley, speaking about the #MeToo movement and Oprah Winfrey's electrifying speech at the Golden Globes. \"People are speaking up and people are banding together and women are coming together,\" which is a theme throughout her book, she said. \"Let's teach girls when they're young to lift each other up, to stand together, to have compassion and empathy for one another instead of trying to climb to the top,\" said Hurley, who runs empowerment groups called \"Girls Can\" for girls between the ages of 5 and 11. \"For too many years, women have had to claw their way to the top and sometimes that means taking down other women in the process and boy, has that been damaging.\" Morgan Guess was a victim of bullying at age 8 and helped lobby for a new bullying definition in the state of Kentucky. She believes there's a tremendous opportunity for dialogue among girls following #MeToo and the #TimesUp campaign, which is raising money for a legal defense fund for women who have experienced harassment, assault or abuse in the workplace.", "\"Girls are still finding their way and being accepted and a part of a group is so highly valued that we should be talking about how acceptance should not come at any cost. And, we should be talking about how girls and women should support one another and celebrate each other's successes,\" said Morgan, who is a high school freshman in Paducah, Kentucky and co-founder of the Guess Anti-Bullying Foundation. \"Even at 15, I don't share some of my achievements for fear of being excluded. How can we encourage success if we don't celebrate it? And, if we don't celebrate each other's successes, how can we go to each other with our dark secrets?\" Abbey Sutzko, a sophomore in high school in Dallas, Pennsylvania, said she has seen \"some amazing girls supporting each other\" and helping them through whatever they need help with since #MeToo.  She also said she knows people who have been victims of sexual harassment and assault who just recently felt comfortable enough to tell their stories and get the help they need. (A new hashtag, #MeTooK12, has been created by the nonproft Stop Sexual Assault in Schools to encourage students who have been victims of sexual assault, abuse or harassment to speak up and share their stories.) \"It also gives us confidence in knowing our stories matter, our opinions matter, and that we can make a difference in our own lives ... and speak up for what we believe,\" Abbey said. 'They don't want to be called bossy' Hurley, who has two kids of her own including an 11-year-old daughter, said in today's society we often talk about raising girls to be assertive but most people don't actually know how to do that. Many girls also don't know what it means to be assertive, she said. In one of her empowerment groups, as an exercise, she told the group of 20 girls that they needed to get better at using the word 'no' and all the girls stared at her, she said.", "She told the girls it's an important word that we all need to know how to use and they told her things such as, \"It's not really that nice to say 'no' and there are other things you can say instead of 'no,' \" said Hurley. She had them practice screaming 'no' and only about a third of the group could do it. \"It was eye-opening in a way,\" said Hurley, the author of \"The Happy Kid Handbook: How to Raise Joyful Children in a Stressful World.\" \"Here are these girls, they were probably third to sixth graders, petrified to just yell the world 'no' because they are socialized to not say 'no.' They are socialized to always be kind and polite first.\" Hurley said when she asks girls what it means to be assertive, they don't want to be assertive because they've been led to believe that assertive and aggressive are one in the same. \"They get called bossy. They don't want to be called bossy so they learn to tone themselves down all the time,\" she said. Mixed messages in the classroom They are also getting mixed messages in the classroom, Hurley said. \"We have this dichotomy where girls consistently outperform boys in the classroom, but boys consistently out-talk girls in the classroom,\" she said. Hurley hopes the #MeToo moment encourages girls to learn what it means to be assertive and to practice putting themselves out there -- in school, with their friends and in their everyday lives.", "Parents can help their daughters learn to flex their assertive muscles by engaging with media with their daughters, and by hosting family debate nights -- every member of the family takes a side on an issue and has to make their case. Kids today are \"bombarded with information, imagery and opinions and judgments all the time so our job is really connecting with them and help to learn how to ... poke holes in the things they're seeing,\" said Hurley. \"It all plays into how they assert themselves and how they present themselves to the world and it's up to us to have those hard talks with them.\" When young women see older women speaking up during the #MeToo movement and when they listen to influential women such as Winfrey sending messages directly to them, they can gain more confidence in themselves, suggests Ella Becker, an eighth grader in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.", "\"Oprah's comments ... definitely make me more confident and feel safer when I need to speak up for myself because I'll know other girls do the same thing,\" said Becker.  \"It definitely is a turning point for girls my age ... because now us girls can grow up in a safer and more equal generation where we are more confident in speaking up for ourselves.\" Isabel, my niece, said she's noticed a big movement online of girls supporting each other since #MeToo, particularly in fashion and beauty communities. \"There's a lot of people lifting each other up rather than being rude or disrespectful.\" She's hopeful that #MeToo will also lead young women to feel more confident in the classroom, to speak up more and not cede their ground.  But she also wisely says it's not just about encouraging girls to be more assertive. We have to focus on young men, too. \"I think a lot of it is the way that we educate boys and teach them not to interrupt girls,\" she said. See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. Hurley, the author and child and adolescent psychotherapist, agrees. She said while building up our girls with self-confidence and assertiveness and encouraging them to lean together as they work their way through girlhood will help raise empowered young women, it is also essential that we take a look at how we raise our boys. \"Just as girls need to learn to stand up to behavior that silences them, boys need to learn how and when to stand down,\" Hurley said. \"Teaching boys not only to respect their female peers, but to embrace what they have to offer, plays an integral role in shifting the current narrative that holds girls back.\"  Do you think #MeToo is helping younger women?

After emerging victorious in both the singles and the doubles on the 1998 junior circuit at the All England Club, Federer reached the final of the junior US Open and won Florida's Orange Bowl Championship \u2014 joining a prestigious group of former champions including Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Bj\u00f6rn Borg. \"I went from boy to man a little bit,\" he says. \"My body grew ... I realized I could serve big [and] all of a sudden hang with tour players. \"I knew there was nobody better than the tour players; that's when the dream became a reality.", "A teenage Federer is pictured relaxing on a beach in Key Biscayne, Florida. \"Who knows,\" the young man thought, \"maybe I could become top 100 in the world at one point?\" Fittingly enough the Bernese Alps were the scene of his first ever ATP tournament, with Federer traveling to the clay-court Swiss Open in Gstaad. The No. 702 bowed out in the first round in straight sets, but he wouldn't have to wait long before his first breakthrough.  September 30, 1998: The day the best male tennis player of all time secured the first of over 1,000 career match victories on the ATP tour, beating world No. 45 Guillame Raoux at the Toulouse Open. Federer went on to reach the quarterfinals in what was just his second ever ATP tournament, losing to the eventual winner, Jan Siemerink. It moved him up over 400 places in the world rankings, and secured a wildcard spot at the upcoming Swiss Indoors \u2014 a tournament he'd been a ballboy at just four years before.  There he faced none other than eight-time grand slam winner Andre Agassi in the first round \u2014 a brush with the big boys that lasted less than an hour.", "The Federer decade At the turn of the millennium, Federer was the youngest man in the top 100 and the tennis world was sitting up and taking notice.  \"I was nervous,\" Federer says, admitting it was still a novelty trading shots with established stars.  \"I'd always wanted to be in that position ... playing against the guys you knew from TV, it was super cool.\" The carpets of the Milan Indoors were the scene of Federer's first ever ATP trophy in February 2001, but the watershed moment of his early career occurred five months later at Wimbledon.", "The king of Wimbledon, Pete Sampras, is dethroned. Pete Sampras vs. Federer. The king vs. the young pretender. The first and only time the boy from Basel would ever play against his idol. A changing of the guard.  Coming into the fourth round clash, Sampras had more grand slam singles titles than any man in history, and hadn't lost a single match at the All England Club for five years -- only failing to win the prestigious tournament once between 1993 and 2000. He left quietly, dethroned by a teenager. \"There are a lot of young guys coming up,\" Sampras reflected, \"but Roger is a bit extra special.\"  Federer himself puts his success down to \"drive\" as much as transcendental talent.  For while the young Swiss was knocked out by home favorite Tim Henman in the 2001 quarterfinal, and stung by Croatian grand slam debutant Mario Ancic in the Wimbledon first round a year later, he's been returning to Centre Court ever since like he owned the place. \"When you're young, it's very important to have that drive \u2014 even when you're defeated \u2014 to go back and hit up against a wall or a cupboard like I did,\" Federer says. \"You do maybe take the hammer and the nail and put the racket up against a wall and say I'm going to walk away from it all ... but five minutes later you're going to pick it up again and you're going to play again. Hard work is key. Probably more than 50% of success at that point.\" After that shock defeat to Ancic, ranked No. 158 at the time, Federer didn't lose again on grass for six years.  From July 2003 to September 2007, the game's undisputed star won 12 of the 18 Grand Slam titles on offer, sweeping aside all before him in Melbourne, London and New York.  An Olympic gold medal followed in Beijing, but one final frontier still eluded him: Roland Garros.  The career grand slam  Clay was the domain of another man, Rafa Nadal, and between 2006 and 2008 Federer had fallen to the Spaniard in three consecutive finals. June 7, 2009: The day Federer finally lifted La Coupe des Mousquetaires, beating Sweden's Robin Soderling to equal Sampras's major record (14) and complete the coveted career grand slam.  Federer called it his \"greatest victory,\" breaking down in tears before a packed crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, telling them \"now I can play in peace for the rest of my career.\"", "Roger Federer kisses the French Open trophy, having beaten Sweden's Robin S\u00f6derling (6-1, 7-6, 6-4) to complete the career grand slam. Detractors had questioned his desire, asking whether this elegant artisan was really up for the long slog on clay. But Federer sat down with CNN Sport that day with the proof in his hands.  \"I always believed that I was good enough to get it,\" he said, \"but actually holding this trophy after all that I've been through is an unbelievable feeling.\"  \"This victory comes at the right time because I've proved many people wrong.\"  Asked what was left to motivate him after reaching the pinnacle of his sport, Federer alluded to his first ever Wimbledon victory.  \"It was all I ever wanted,\" he smiled. \"But I kept coming back and won it again and again and again.\"  \"That's what champions want to do: they want to come back and prove themselves over and again. \"I love the game too much to walk away from it; it's given me all I ever wanted.\" A rivalry revisited If Martina Navratilova had echoed the prevailing sentiment in 2009 when she said the newly-crowned French Open champion could now \"just go on and sip Margaritas for the rest of his life,\" Federer himself had no intention of letting up.  His 2017 Australian Open final win against Rafa Nadal was a triumph of longevity \u2014 his first major title for five years and one that and that made him the oldest male grand slam winner since Roy Emerson in 1967.  \"It's really strange to me,\" the 35-year-old told CNN Sport in January, having expected to reach \"a fourth round or a quarterfinal\" at best.", "\"The first time I actually believed I could win the title was maybe Saturday or Sunday morning; I just started seeing flashes of me with the trophy.\" Had Federer not fought back from 3-1 down in the fifth set \u2014 beating his friend and long-time nemesis in a major final for the first time in ten years \u2014 Nadal could have closed the all-time gap between them to just two grand slams with his favored French Open to follow.  Now though Federer's tally of 18 looks unlikely to be beaten."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

It is $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International posted lower second-quarter revenue and a worsening loss but its stock jumped after the embattled company's new CEO signaled plans to retool. The Montreal-based company's shares rose $5.71, or 25%, to close Tuesday at $28.16. Revenue fell 11.4% to $2.42 billion for the quarter, missing S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst estimates of $2.45 billion. The company's loss similarly widened to $302 million from $53 million a year ago, missing estimates of $261 million. The results came just over a year after Valeant's shares peaked at $262.52, before starting a plunge that erased roughly 90% of their value. The slide came amid multiple investigations of the company's drug pricing and marketing practices, as well as allegations about Valeant's since-cancelled distribution deal with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services. Valeant shares (VRX) surged after CEO Joseph Papa issued a statement announcing \"a new strategic direction\" that \"at its heart has a mission to improve patients' lives and will involve reorganizing our company and reporting segments.\" \"Although it will take time to implement and execute our turnaround plan, I am confident that we will show progress in the coming quarters,\" said Papa, who succeeded former CEO J.

The company projected 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $6.60 to $7, and total revenue of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion. If met, the projections would keep the company from violating its debt covenants. The company also said that it had reached a deal to sell its North American sales rights to a drug called Ruconest to Pharming Group for up to $125 million. That deal is part of recent steps to offload certain intellectual property totaling upfront payments of $181 million and up to $329 million in potential additional capital based on certain benchmarks. At the same time, Valeant signaled plans to cut more than $5 billion from the company's $30.7 billion in long-term debt over the next year and a half. In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Papa said Valeant had stabilized turnover in its sales force and is moving forward with the second phase of a branded prescription distribution agreement with pharmacy giant Walgreens. Valeant is also examining a potential reformulation of its top-selling drub Xifaxan, a medication that treats irritable bowel syndrome, \"to improve the customer experience,\" Papa said. The plan follows the February disclosure by Ireland-based rival Allergan that it is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to produce a generic version.

While it is currently the start of winter at the South Pole and sea ice extent is expanding, current levels show the extent is right around 13.1 million square kilometers, far below the average extent at this time of year around 14 million square kilometers.

The original version of this article (see below), published in September 2013, was headlined \u201cAntarctic sea ice hit 35-year record high\u201d. But there has been a marked decline in Antarctic ice extent ever since.", "Antarctic sea ice extent since 1979. (NASA, adapted by CWG)  When this story previously highlighted the record high Antarctic sea ice extent, some who deny climate change shared it to sow doubt about the reality of climate warming. But as I explained then (see below), and reiterate now, Antarctic sea ice behavior is not a straight forward or terribly useful indicator of climate change because it is influenced by many factors beyond temperature. Of course, now that the Antarctic sea ice is at record low levels, it makes citing Antarctic sea ice data as evidence refuting global warming even more preposterous. Yet at the same time, because Antarctic sea ice trends are so complex and variable, it\u2019s also unwise to tout the current level as an unambiguous indicator of climate warming. \u201cIt is tempting to say that the record low we are seeing this year is global warming finally catching up with Antarctica,\u201d said Walt Meier, sea ice specialist at NASA. \u201cHowever, this might just be an extreme case of pushing the envelope of year-to-year variability. We\u2019ll need to have several more years of data to be able to say there has been a significant change in the trend.\u201d More straight forward indicators of climate change include ocean heat content, sea level rise, Arctic sea ice (currently near record low levels), and of course, surface and atmospheric temperatures. And all of these indicators show the Earth is warming and support multiple lines of evidence that this warming is mostly human-caused. Original post from September 23, 2013", "Antarctic sea ice extent on September 22 compared to 1981-2010 median depicted by orange curve (NSIDC)  Antarctic sea ice has grown to a record large extent for a second straight year, baffling scientists seeking to understand why this ice is expanding rather than shrinking in a warming world. On Saturday, the ice extent reached 19.51 million square kilometers, according to data posted on the National Snow and Ice Data Center Web site. That number bested record high levels set earlier this month and in 2012 (of 19.48 million square kilometers). Records date back to October 1978.", "(NSIDC)  The increasing ice is especially perplexing since the water beneath the ice has warmed, not cooled. \u201cThe overwhelming evidence is that the Southern Ocean is warming,\u201d said Jinlun Zhang, a University of Washington scientist, studying Antarctic ice. \u201cWhy would sea ice be increasing? Although the rate of increase is small, it is a puzzle to scientists.\u201d In a new study in the Journal of Climate, Zhang finds both strengthening and converging winds around the South Pole can explain 80 percent of the increase in ice volume which has been observed. \u201cThe polar vortex that swirls around the South Pole is not just stronger than it was when satellite records began in the 1970s, it has more convergence, meaning it shoves the sea ice together to cause ridging,\u201d the study\u2019s press release explains. \u201cStronger winds also drive ice faster, which leads to still more deformation and ridging. This creates thicker, longer-lasting ice, while exposing surrounding water and thin ice to the blistering cold winds that cause more ice growth.\u201d But no one seems to have a conclusive answer as to why winds are behaving this way. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a clear explanation yet of why the winds have gotten stronger,\u201d Zhang told Michael Lemonick of Climate Central. Some point to stratospheric ozone depletion, but a new study published in the Journal of Climate notes that computer models simulate declining \u2013 not increasing \u2013 Antarctic sea ice in recent decades due to this phenomenon (aka the ozone \u201chole\u201d). \u201cThis modeled Antarctic sea ice decrease in the last three decades is at odds with observations, which show a small yet statistically significant increase in sea ice extent,\u201d says the study, led by Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Elizabeth Barnes. A recent study by Lorenzo Polvani and Karen Smith of Columbia University says the model-defying sea ice increase may just reflect natural variability. If the increase in ice is due to natural variability, Zhang says, warming from manmade greenhouse gases should eventually overcome it and cause the ice to begin retreating. \u201cIf the warming continues, at some point the trend will reverse,\u201d Zhang said. However, a conclusion of the Barnes study is that the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer \u2013 now underway \u2013 may slow/delay Antarctic warming and ice melt. Ultimately, it\u2019s apparent the relationship between ozone depletion, climate warming from greenhouse gases, natural variability, and how Antarctic ice responds is all very complicated. In sharp contrast, in the Arctic, there seems to be a relatively straight forward relationship between temperature and ice extent. Thus, in the Antarctic, we shouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to witness the kind of steep decline in ice that has occurred in the Arctic. \u201c\u2026the seeming paradox of Antarctic ice increasing while Arctic ice is decreasing is really no paradox at all,\u201d explains Climate Central\u2019s Lemonick. \u201cThe Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land, while the Antarctic is land surrounded by ocean. In the Arctic, moreover, you\u2019ve got sea ice decreasing in the summer; at the opposite pole, you\u2019ve got sea ice increasing in the winter. It\u2019s not just an apples-and-oranges comparison: it\u2019s more like comparing apple pie with orange juice.\u201d"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star announced his plans to bring an MLS team to Miami four years ago.

A stressful day at the office. A fight with your significant other. A stretch of cold, dreary weather that has you feeling the winter blues. Chances are, all of these scenarios trigger that hankering for a certain comfort food. People tend to seek high-calorie, high-fat foods during periods of stress. Thirty-eight percent of adults report that they have overeaten or eaten unhealthy foods in the past month because of stress, according to the American Psychological Association. People feeling sad also tend to eat more of less-healthy comfort foods than when they feel happy, according to research out of Cornell University. When stress, seasonal blues or sadness has you looking for comfort in the cupboard, what is it that you reach for? Ranker recently conducted a survey to determine which comfort foods are the most loved by Americans, and the foods that top the list comes as no surprise: chocolate, grilled cheese, pizza \u2026 Why exactly are these comfort foods so, well, comforting? A study published in the journal Appetite found that there is a \u201csocial\u201d component to foods that provide us solace: A food is comforting because of the memories they evoke, and the emotions and relationships that we associate with them. If your grandmother served you chocolate chip cookies as a child that may be why you make a pit stop at the bakery on your way home from the office after a particularly stressful day. \u201cComfort foods are often the foods that our caregivers gave us when we were children. As long we have positive association with the person who made that food then there\u2019s a good chance that you will be drawn to that food during times of rejection or isolation,\u201d says Shira Gabriel, psychologist at the University of Buffalo and co-author of the study. \u201cThe study helps us understand why we might be eating comfort foods even when we\u2019re dieting or not particularly hungry.\u201d Another recent study published in the International Journal of Gastronomy and Food Science confirmed that certain foods take on their role as comfort food through the association with positive social encounters in our past.

It's a crucially important question in light of the horrible news out of Texas, but even for PhDs, it's a tough one. There's been a mountain of research on the subject, but these dozens of studies conducted over many years and in many different countries reach a broad and sometimes contradictory range of conclusions. It's hard to know what it really tells us, taken together, about whether gun laws can reduce gun violence. A 2016 study, published in the academic journal Epidemiologic Reviews, seeks to resolve this problem. It systematically reviewed the evidence from around the world on gun laws and gun violence, looking to see if the best studies come to similar conclusions. It was the first such study to look at the international research in this way. The authors are careful to note that their findings do not conclusively prove that gun restrictions reduce gun deaths. However, they did find a compelling trend whereby new restrictions on gun purchasing and ownership tended to be followed by a decline in gun deaths. \"Across countries, instead of seeing an increase in the homicide rate, we saw a reduction,\" Julian Santaella-Tenorio, a doctoral student in epidemiology at Columbia University and the study's lead author, told me in an interview shortly after publication. What the study found", "Guns collected during Australia's 1996 buyback.", "Santaella-Tenorio's study (co-authored with Columbia professors Magdalena Cerd\u00e1 and Sandro Galea, as well as the University of North Carolina's Andr\u00e9s Villaveces) examined roughly 130 studies that had been conducted in 10 different countries. Each of those 130 studies had looked at some specific change in gun laws and its effect on homicide and/or suicide rates. Most of them looked at law changes in the developed world, such as the US, Australia, and Austria, while a few looked at gun laws in developing countries, specifically Brazil and South Africa. This isn't, then, a study that compiled its own original data on one specific gun law. It's actually more valuable than that: It's telling us what all the different studies on individual laws say when you examine them put together. So what do Santaella-Tenorio et al. conclude? First, and most importantly, that gun violence declined after countries pass a raft of gun laws at the same time: \"The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths,\" the study finds. This finding doesn't highlight one specific law, like an assault weapon ban, in isolation. There were \"so many different kinds of laws,\" Santaella-Tenorio told me, that it was hard to make good international comparisons on every specific kind of gun restriction. Rather, countries passed big packages of gun laws, which overhauled the nation's firearm code fairly broadly, which all tended to share similar features. According to Santaella-Tenorio, they generally included: Banning powerful weapons, like automatic rifles. Implementing a background check system. Requiring people to get permits and licenses before buying a gun. South Africa's comprehensive Firearm Control Act, passed in 2000, contained all these measures. One study found that firearm homicides in five major South African cities decreased by 13.6 percent per year for the next five years. \"Reductions in nonfirearm homicides were also observed,\" Santaella-Tenorio et al. note, \"although not as pronounced as the ones observed for firearm homicides.\" Austria's 1997 firearm law, similarly, required background checks, limited access to powerful firearms, and imposed rules about how gun owners had to store their guns. Santaella-Tenorio reviewed two studies on Austria's 1997 law, both of which found evidence that the law had reduced deaths. According to one of them, firearm homicides went down by 4.8 percent, while suicides went down by 9.9 percent. Australia's 1996 National Firearms Agreement (which outright confiscated 650,000 guns, in addition to imposing background checks and licensing rules) is perhaps the best-studied of any of the international laws. Santaella-Tenorio et al. reviewed eight studies on it, most of which found clear and strong evidence of a reduction in firearm deaths after the law's passage. One study, for example, compared the Australian state of Victoria to others around the country. Victoria had passed a raft of firearm restrictions in 1988, so the NFA didn't change policy there that much. But firearm deaths went down countrywide by an average of 14 percent in other states relative to Victoria, suggesting that the NFA provisions specifically had made the difference. Santaella-Tenorio and his co-authors also found evidence that specific laws, such as background checks and rules on storage, reduced specific kinds of gun deaths. \"Laws restricting the purchase of (e.g., background checks) and access to (e.g., safer storage) firearms,\" they write, \"are also associated with lower rates of intimate partner homicides and firearm unintentional deaths in children, respectively.\" What they learned about guns in America", "(Shutterstock)", "Santaella-Tenorio and his colleagues looked at a number of studies on gun control in the United States as part of their overall review. There was strong evidence that that restricting access to guns tends to reduce gun deaths. One study, for example, looked at Missouri's 2007 repeal of its law requiring a permit to purchase a firearm, which in effect repealed the state's background check requirement. This study found that after 2007, Missouri's homicide rate jumped by 25 percent. No other changes in law or circumstance appear to be able to explain the increase. By contrast, laws favored by the National Rifle Association (such as concealed carry or stand your ground), when implemented, either had no effect on gun deaths or increased gun violence. And Santaella-Tenorio found this by considering not just studies that reached this conclusion, but also studies that supported loosening gun laws. Most of the studies that supported these laws were written by a handful of authors, like Florida State's Gary Kleck and Fox News columnist John Lott. Scholars who reexamined their conclusions, sometimes even using their own data, generally came to the opposite results. For instance, a study by Lott and the University of Georgia's David Mustard found that laws permitting concealed carry reduced homicides in states and counties that passed them. However, a subsequent study that reexamined the same data found no effect, and that Lott and Mustard had used flawed statistical procedures in examining the data. Another Lott study found that castle doctrine laws \u2014 laws that eliminate the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force, but only in your home \u2014 reduced homicides by 9 percent. But a second study came to the opposite conclusion, finding an uptick in homicides after states passed such laws. A third study looking at stand-your-ground laws \u2014 which go beyond castle doctrine in eliminating retreat duties outside the home as well \u2014 also found an uptick in deaths. Santaella-Tenorio and his coauthors summarize: \"Stand your ground laws were associated with a 6.8% increase in homicide rates, mainly driven by increments (14.7%) in homicide rates among white males.\" The point, then, is that the pro-gun studies tended to be outliers in the literature, and were not supported by the most rigorous available analysis. \"Our goal was just to see what was out there, and identify the quality of the studies,\" Santaella-Tenorio told me. \"We eventually found that many others had used Lott's data, and they have found different results after adjusting for other variables, or using more years of data, or using different models.\" This isn't conclusive, but it's powerful evidence", "Ryan Houston/Moment/Getty Images", "In our conversation, Santaella-Tenorio was insistent that he and his colleagues have not \"proven\" that gun laws reduce violence. The data, he says, is simply too complicated, and the analyses too primitive, to come to such a hard conclusion. \"It's really hard. In epidemiological studies \u2014 for example, pharmaceutical ones \u2014 you can randomly select your groups, and then have one group exposed to the pill and the other group not exposed,\" he says. \"However, in policy studies ... you can't have some states be exposed to legislation and other states not.\" This helps explain some unusual results. For instance, some data from Quebec found that a Canadian law reducing access to firearms led to an increase in suicides by hanging \u2014 a large enough increase to offset the decline in suicides by firearm that followed the law. Other studies, from Australia and New Zealand, found a similar substitution effect. However, there is very good evidence \u2014 some of it from the same countries \u2014 that reducing access to guns reduces overall suicides. Indeed, Santaella-Tenorio himself believes that despite those three studies, limiting access to guns is very likely to reduce suicide rates overall. \"There's some other evidence that we didn't include in this review,\" he says, that finds attempting suicide is an impulsive decision that people regret (if they fail) and thus don't repeat. Firearms, because they're much more effective than taking pills or slashing your wrists, don't give people that option. Thus, reducing access to guns should (and empirically generally does) reduce the overall suicide rate. This illustrates, then, that the findings in this study don't end the academic debate over guns. It's limited by study design \u2014 it only reviewed studies on firearm policy changes, not firearm ownership in general \u2014 and the inherent limitations in studying the effect of complicated public policy issues. Nonetheless, this is a very important contribution to the gun debate. About 130 studies, from 10 different countries, converged on the idea gun deaths declined after laws restricting access to firearms went into force. While it's not conclusive, it is very, very suggestive."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

They all have their chromosomes organized the same way \u2014 same genes, same order,\u201d Ostrander said.   \u201cIt\u2019s very subtle variation in small numbers of genes that account for that very large difference in morphology that we see across breeds.\u201d   So while it might take hundreds of mutations to mark the difference between a human who\u2019s 5\u20196\u201d and one who\u2019s 6\u20196\u201d tall, Ostrander said, it only takes a \u201ccouple of dozen\u201d genetic mutations to make a Chihuahua different from a Great Dane.   The goal is to track disease-causing genetic mutations, which often translate to human disease genes, Ostrander says.   \u201cWe have a yellow brick road for figuring out how mutations move around the dog world,\u201d Ostrander told NBC News.   \u201cWe recognize that everything humans get, dogs get \u2014 epilepsy, cancer, diabetes, heart disease,\u201d she added. But in dogs, these disease traits often pop up more commonly in specific breeds.   \u201cWe can actually trace diseases as they move around the dog breed population,\u201d Ostrander said.   \u201cFor instance, collie eye anomaly is a disease that affects \u2026 several herding breeds, including the collie, Border collie, Shetland sheepdog, and Australian shepherd,\u201d the research team wrote in their study, published in Cell Reports.

But the genetic analysis shows Nova Scotia duck tolling retrievers have a lot of collie and Shetland sheepdog forebears.", "A diagram representing the genetic analysis of dog breeds reveals how past migrations led to the mixing of multiple breeds.

I want my dog to represent Otterhound-ness\u2019.\u201d   Otterhounds, it seems, are close relatives of fox hounds and blood hounds, according to the new family tree.   The new gene map links German shepherds to Australian shepherds, which had not been a known ancestor of German shepherds.   And it finds that unique American genes linger in two breeds of dog \u2014 the Mexican hairless, also called a Xoloitzcuintlel, and the Peruvian Hairless Dog.   \"What we noticed is that there are groups of American dogs that separated somewhat from the European breeds,\" said Heidi Parker, who helped lead the work. \"We've been looking for some kind of signature of the New World Dog, and these dogs have New World Dogs hidden in their genome.\"   The ancestors of these dogs came over with the original settlers of the Americans 13,000 years ago \u2014 or perhaps even longer before that. But European and Asian imports mostly bred out the original American dogs and the two American hairless breeds now carry a healthy dose of German shepherd genes, the analysis showed.   Other findings:  Terriers and mastiffs were crossed to create fighting dogs and map back to Irish terrier breeds from the 1860s and 1870s. \"Gun dogs,\" such as Golden Retrievers and Irish Setters originated in Victorian England, when hunting with guns became a popular gentlemen's sport. Herding dogs seem to be have been bred several different times and in several different places. \"When we were looking at herding breeds, we saw much more diversity, where there was a particular group of herding breeds that seemed to come out of the United Kingdom, a particular group that came out of northern Europe, and a different group that came out of southern Europe,\" Parker said.

Information, provided by other media sources, could not be confirmed. Stars dying without wills? It's a notion that's difficult to grasp, particularly when musicians' estates often continue to generate significant revenue after their deaths. Yet in some cases, famous faces were just like a lot of us, and despite their millions, put shoring up their finances on the back burner. We don't know yet if Prince's reported $300 million estate will end up in probate court (his sister, Tyka Nelson, says he died without a will in place), but here's a look at celebrities who died without wills in place \u2013 and the fallout that ensued. Michael Jackson Age at the time of death: 50  Financial status: Jackson's family initially thought he didn\u2019t have a will, and headed to court. Eventually, courtesy of his lawyers, a will surfaced, signed seven years before the pop star's death. Upon its discovery, mom Katherine Jackson withdrew her petition asking to be put in charge of her son's estate. Jackson's will named the pop star's longtime attorney John Branca and music executive John McClain as administrators of the estate. Katherine Jackson was named as a permanent guardian to her son's three children, Prince Michael I, Paris and Prince Michael II. She was also named a beneficiary of a trust set up by her son. Singer Diana Ross was named a successor guardian for the children and their estates. But it's not over. The Hollywood Reporter says that thanks to posthumous projects such as the 2009 documentary This Is It (which grossed $261 million), a Cirque du Soleil tribute plus albums, video games and other lucrative memorials, a possible billion-dollar IRS estate tax battle looms. As THR puts it, \"Now the IRS wants its share, claiming the value of Jackson's name and image upon death amounted to more than $434 million. The estate's own valuation? Just $2,105.\"", "Amy Winehouse Age at the time of death: 27 Financial status: The soulful Brit, who died in 2011 from alcohol poisoning, was thought to have a will, but ultimately did not. Winehouse's parents ended up inheriting her fortune, with the singer's father, Mitch Winehouse, acting as the administrator of her estate. It's notable that in Amy, the Oscar-winning documentary about the singer, Winehouse was shown to have a contentious relationship with her father. (Mitch Winehouse called the documentary \"misleading.\") Winehouse's estate totaled $4.66 million after debts and taxes, according to the Associated Press. Her ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, did not receive anything.", "Bob Marley  Age at the time of death: 36 Financial status: Here's a cautionary tale about estate planning: 30+ years after Marley's death, his heirs were still battling the singer's estate in court. Marley, who died of cancer in 1981, famously left no written will, and under Jamaican law his estate was to be divided among his wife and 11 children. That meant Marley's wife, Rita, received only 10 percent of his assets. After years of court battles, Rita and Marley's family was rewarded with a decision that they were entitled to Marley's name and likeness. Marley's estate has since aggressively defended commercial use of Marley's likeness, songs and intellectual property through the years. Five years ago the estate sued Richard Booker, Marley's half-brother, for giving Jamaican tours and coordinating music festivals in his brother's name. (The case was settled out of court.)", "Jimi Hendrix  Age at the time of death: 27 Financial status: Hendrix died in 1970 without a will. The fight over his estate went on for more than 30 years. The famed guitarist's siblings had been feuding since 2002, when their father, Al Hendrix, died and left Jimi's sister Janie in control of the musician's $80-million estate. The Washington State Supreme Court upheld the will but the siblings continued battling over the use of the singer's image. According to Rolling Stone, a settlement was finally reached before a scheduled July 2015 jury trial to determine how much Hendrix Licensing, a company run by brother Leon's business partner, owed to the Jimi Hendrix estate in terms of damages for sales of unauthorized merchandise.", "Sonny Bono Age at the time of death:  62 Financial status: Bono's death came as a shock: the entertainer-turned-congressman died in a skiing accident in 1998. His wife, Mary Bono, had to go through probate court to become the executor of her husband's estate. A love child also appeared (but later withdrew his claim). Ultimately, Bono\u2019s estate was divided between Mary Bono (who became his political successor for 14 years), and his two children, Chaz Bono and Christy Bono Fasce.", "Kurt Cobain Age at the time of death: 27 Financial status: When Cobain died, he left behind a fortune that was estimated in the millions. In recent years, the estimated value has been in excess of $450 million. After the singer's death in 1994, wife Courtney Love was the primary beneficiary of the publishing rights to his estate, which included almost all of Nirvana's music, reports CNBC. In 2010, the couple's then-18-year-old daughter, Frances Bean, took control of her trust fund which was more than a third of the estate. That same year, Love gave up rights to Cobain's name and likeness for a loan, according to CNBC.

Using the premonitions of sentient mutants called \u201cpre-cogs\u201d, the police are able to predict when someone is going to commit a crime before it happens, swooping down from helicopters and arresting them on the street before they can do anything. Their \u201ccrime\u201d is that they merely thought about it. Palantir, the CIA-backed startup, is Minority Report come true. It is all-powerful, yet no one knows it even exists. Palantir does not have an office, it has a \u201cSCIF\u201d on a back street in Palo Alto, California. SCIF stands for \u201csensitive compartmentalised information facility\u201d. Palantir says its building \u201cmust be built to be resistant to attempts to access the information within.

A palantir is a \u201cseeing stone\u201d in JRR Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings; a dark orb used by Saruman to be able to see in darkness or blinding light. \u201cPalantir\u201d means \u201cone that sees from afar\u201d, a mythical instrument of omnipotence.                 Saruman with his seeing stone in The Lord of the Rings.", "In 2004, Peter Thiel \u2013 the billionaire PayPal co-founder, Facebook investor and and latter-day Trump ally \u2013 created Palantir alongside Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen and Alex Karp. Their intention was to create a company that took Big Data somewhere no one else dared to go. In 2013, Karp, Palantir\u2019s CEO, announced that the company would not be pursuing an IPO, as going public would make \u201crunning a company like ours very difficult\u201d. This is why. Palantir watches everything you do and predicts what you will do next in order to stop it. As of 2013, its client list included the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the Centre for Disease Control, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point and the IRS. Up to 50% of its business is with the public sector. In-Q-Tel, the CIA\u2019s venture arm, was an early investor.                         Palantir helped convict ponzi-schemer Bernie Madoff. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features", "Palantir tracks everyone from potential terrorist suspects to corporate fraudsters (Bernie Madoff was imprisoned with the help of Palantir), child traffickers and what they refer to as \u201csubversives\u201d. But it is all done using prediction. In Iraq, the Pentagon used Palantir software to track patterns in roadside bomb deployment and worked out garage-door openers were being used as remote detonators by predicting it. Palantir allowed the marines to upload DNA samples from remote locations and tap into information gathered from years of collecting fingerprints and DNA evidence, the results returned almost immediately. Without Palantir, suspects would have already moved on to a different location by the time the field agents received the results. Using the most sophisticated data mining, Palantir can predict the future, seconds or years before it happens. Samuel Reading \u2013 a former marine who has worked in Afghanistan for NEK Advanced Securities Group, a US military contractor \u2013 has said: \u201cIt\u2019s the combination of every analytical tool you could ever dream of. You will know every single bad guy in your area.\u201d Palantir is at the heart of the US government, but with its other arm, Palantir Metropolis, it provides the analytical tools for hedge funds, banks and financial services firms to outsmart each other. Palantir does not just provide the Pentagon with a machine for global surveillance and the data-efficient fighting of war, it runs Wall Street, too. Palantir is exactly what it says it is: a giant digital eye like Saruman\u2019s seeing stone in The Lord of the Rings. On the streets of Chicago and Los Angeles, Palantir is getting closest to Philip K Dick\u2019s vision of the future, now. In the film, a premonition of an Orwellian thought-police state, crime rates drop to zero as the pre-crime unit successfully imprisons thousands of individuals for merely thinking of committing a felony.                 Palantir\u2019s co-founder Peter Thiel. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images", "However, when Cruise\u2019s character begins to question the morality of what he is doing, his superiors detect a threat to the entire pre-crime programme. In order to get rid of him, Cruise is framed for a murder by altering the data of his thought history. In the final showdown with his boss, it is explained to Cruise that sometimes the numbers need to lie for the greater good of society. Minority Report is set in 2054, but Palantir is putting pre-crime into operation now. The Los Angeles Police Department has used Palantir to predict who will commit a crime by swooping Minority Report-style on suspects. Palantir calls its work with the LAPD \u201cimproving situational awareness, and responding to crime in real time\u201d. Algorithms take in data on the location, time and date of previously committed crimes and this data is superimposed to create hotspots on a map for police officers to patrol. A 2013 video about \u201cpredictive policing\u201d by the National Science Foundation features an officer explaining how they used one of these maps to prevent an assault \u201cbefore it happened\u201d. Military-grade surveillance technology has now migrated from Fallujah to the suburban neighbourhoods of LA. Predictive policing is being used on illegal drivers and petty criminals through a redeployment of techniques and algorithms used by the US army dealing with insurgents in Iraq and with civilian casualty patterns. When the US is described as a \u201cwar zone\u201d between police and young black males, it is rarely mentioned that tactics developed by the US military in a real war zone are actually being deployed. Is predictive policing as a counter-insurgency tactic a contributing factor in the epidemic of police shootings of unarmed black men in the past four years?                         Could predictive policing contribute to police shootings of black people? Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images", "One could argue that sophisticated pre-crime algorithms are not necessary when being black and male is seen as reason enough for the police to swoop. What predictive policing has done is militarise American cities, creating a heightened culture of suspicion and fear in areas where tensions are highest and policing is already most difficult. Officers being led to certain neighbourhoods solely because of an algorithm is enough to cause tension; enough to ignite a powder keg and push a delicate policing situation over the edge. Ana Muniz is an activist and researcher who works with the Inglewood-based Youth Justice Coalition. \u201cAny time that a society\u2019s military and domestic police become more similar, the lines blur,\u201d she told LA Weekly. \u201cThe military is supposed to defend the territory from external enemies, that\u2019s not the mission of the police \u2013 they\u2019re not supposed to look at the population as an external enemy.\u201d In 2010, the LAPD announced a partnership with Motorola Solutions to monitor the Jordan Downs public housing project with surveillance cameras. In 2013, they announced the deployment of live CCTV cameras with facial-recognition software in San Fernando Valley, reported to be programmed to ID suspects on a \u201chot list\u201d. Data merely becomes a new way of reinforcing old prejudices. Critics of these analytics argue that from the moment a police officer with the pre-crime mindset that you are a criminal steps out of their patrol car to confront you, your fate has been sealed. In 2013, TechCrunch obtained a leaked report on the use of Palantir by the LA and Chicago police departments. Sgt Peter Jackson of the LAPD was quoted as saying: \u201cDetectives love the type of information [Palantir] provides. They can now do things that we could not do before.\u201d Palantir is immensely secretive. It wields as much real-world power as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, but unlike them, Palantir operates so far under the radar, it is special ops. \u2022 This is an extract from Done: The Secret Deals That Are Changing Our World by Jacques Peretti (Hodder & Stoughton, \u00a320), available now.

Andelman colabora con CNN y escribe art\u00edculos para el diario estadounidense Usa Today. Escribi\u00f3 el libro A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today. Fue corresponsal extranjero del New York Times y corresponsal de CBS News en Par\u00eds. S\u00edguelo en Twitter como @DavidAndelman. Las opiniones expresadas en esta columna son exclusivas de su autor. (CNN) \u2014 Sin importar qui\u00e9n est\u00e9 en el despacho oval, hay demasiado en juego y el resultado potencial es demasiado horrible como para dejar el arsenal nuclear totalmente en manos de cualquier presidente, especialmente de Donald Trump, quien, de acuerdo con Joe Scarborough, de MSNBC, pregunt\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a: \"Si las tenemos, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no podemos usarlas?\". Cuando era director de Inteligencia Nacional de Estados Unidos, James Clapper dijo a CNN: \"Me preocupa [su] acceso a los c\u00f3digos de lanzamiento de armas nucleares, si en un arranque de resentimiento decide hacer algo respecto a Kim Jong Un; en realidad se puede hacer muy poco para detenerlo\". Al parecer, el pueblo estadounidense comparte esta inquietud respecto al temperamento de Trump. En una encuesta  que llev\u00f3 a cabo recientemente la Universidad de Quinnipiac, se determin\u00f3 que el 68% de los encuestados piensa que Trump no es equilibrado, a diferencia del 29% que piensa que s\u00ed lo es. Como Trump est\u00e1 pensando en perfeccionar el arsenal nuclear de Estados Unidos, evitar que su pulgar sea el \u00fanico que pueda presionar el bot\u00f3n nuclear es a\u00fan m\u00e1s urgente. En pocas palabras, es aterrador que este presidente tenga el control total y absoluto del malet\u00edn nuclear. Una selecci\u00f3n cambiante de oficiales militares lleva el portafolio de aluminio de 20 kilos, contenido en un malet\u00edn de cuero, a donde quiera que el presidente vaya. Contiene los blancos nucleares que solo \u00e9l puede activar con el \"bizcocho \", una tarjetita que lleva consigo y que contiene los c\u00f3digos para lanzar todo o parte del arsenal estrat\u00e9gico estadounidense desde cualquier parte del mundo en la que el comandante en jefe se encuentre.", "(Cr\u00e9dito: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) Cuando el presidente est\u00e1 en la Casa Blanca, el malet\u00edn est\u00e1 desactivado, ya que el presidente ordenar\u00eda la activaci\u00f3n de los c\u00f3digos de lanzamiento desde la Sala de Crisis, en donde siempre hay un comando completo: al menos seis personas en servicio las 24 horas, los siete d\u00edas, en cinco turnos diferentes . Con todo, si el presidente ordenara un ataque, tiene la autoridad definitiva aunque haya quienes se opongan. El malet\u00edn nuclear fue producto de la presidencia de Kennedy: tras el desastre de bah\u00eda de Cochinos, el presidente pens\u00f3 que ser\u00eda \u00fatil tener un medio para tomar represalias r\u00e1pida y eficazmente en caso de que alguna potencia nuclear atacara a Estados Unidos. En esos d\u00edas, eso significaba la Uni\u00f3n Sovi\u00e9tica. Hoy, Vladimir Putin siempre est\u00e1 cerca de su propio malet\u00edn, el Cheget, sin importar en d\u00f3nde est\u00e9. Donald Trump tiene m\u00e1s de 900 ojivas nucleares, con una potencia equivalente a la de unas 17.000 bombas como la que se lanz\u00f3 sobre Hiroshima, a su disposici\u00f3n y totalmente accesibles a trav\u00e9s del malet\u00edn. Como dijo al New York Times Franklin C. Miller, un especialista nuclear que trabaj\u00f3 para el Departamento de Defensa de Estados Unidos durante 22 a\u00f1os , \"no hay veto una vez que el presidente ordena un ataque. El presidente y solo el presidente tiene la autoridad para ordenar el uso de armas nucleares\". Sin embargo, la soluci\u00f3n a la cuesti\u00f3n de que una sola persona tenga todo este poder podr\u00eda estar al alcance. Como se report\u00f3 en el sitio web  Pol\u00edtico, el jefe de gabinete de la Casa Blanca, John Kelly, \"est\u00e1 implementando un sistema que se us\u00f3 en presidencias previas para limitar la competencia interna\u2026 y para tener la \u00faltima palabra respecto al material que pasa por el escritorio del presidente\". En espec\u00edfico, el secretario de gabinete de la Casa Blanca, Rob Porter, \"revisar\u00e1 todos los documentos que pasen por el escritorio del Despacho Oval\", agreg\u00f3 Pol\u00edtico. Pero \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 nada m\u00e1s los documentos? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no tambi\u00e9n cada vez que el presidente mire de reojo el malet\u00edn nuclear o, Dios no lo quiera, ordene que se abra? No cabe duda de que negarle al presidente el acceso al malet\u00edn ser\u00eda una infracci\u00f3n que ameritar\u00eda una corte marcial. La lealtad y la cordura de las personas elegidas para este trabajo entran en un nivel de seguridad especial llamado Yankee White . Pero \u00bfqu\u00e9 pasar\u00eda si el oficial militar que lo lleva insiste en avisarle a John Kelly antes de dejar que el presidente acceda a su contenido? \u00bfY si el presidente se niega? Es evidente que cualquier persona sensata huir\u00eda de inmediato con el malet\u00edn bajo el brazo. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tribunal lo condenar\u00eda? Pese a todo, hay una soluci\u00f3n. El Congreso deber\u00eda, simplemente, promulgar una ley que disponga que el portador del malet\u00edn nuclear o cualquier miembro del personal de la Sala de Crisis de la Casa Blanca le avise inmediatamente a Kelly, al asesor de seguridad nacional, H. R. McMaster, o al secretario de Defensa, Jim Mattis, si Trump ordena que se abra el malet\u00edn. Actualmente, ambos partidos respaldan un freno legislativo a una medida internacional potencialmente vol\u00e1til que Trump podr\u00eda optar por tomar: levantar, a su discreci\u00f3n, las sanciones sobre Rusia. Esa medida se aprob\u00f3 en ambas c\u00e1maras por una mayor\u00eda abrumadora, a prueba de vetos, as\u00ed que Trump est\u00e1 obligado a promulgarla. Una propuesta de ley respecto al malet\u00edn nuclear deber\u00eda tener el mismo apoyo abrumador. Hace una d\u00e9cada, el entonces vicepresidente, Dick Cheney, advirti\u00f3 en ABC News que el presidente (que en ese entonces era George W. Bush) \"podr\u00eda lanzar un ataque devastador como el que el mundo nunca ha visto. No tiene que consultarlo con nadie. No tiene que llamar al Congreso; no tiene que consultar a los tribunales. Tiene esa autoridad por la naturaleza del mundo en el que vivimos. Es desafortunado, pero creo que somos perfectamente aptos para tomar las medidas con las que contamos\"."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Credit Eduardo Munoz/Reuters", "By the time my third child was born, I was in pediatric practice, advising new mothers about the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines: exclusive breast-feeding for the baby\u2019s first six months. Then, as foods are introduced, continuing breast-feeding until at least the first birthday. I had not managed either with my first two children, one born while I was in medical school, the second right at the end of my residency. I had breast-fed them both, but relied on formula to get through day care days, and the breast-feeding had ended altogether by seven or eight months. But with my third, since I was a full-fledged practicing pediatrician, I felt a moral obligation to follow the recommendations that I had been earnestly dispensing. So I borrowed an electric breast pump and got serious. Like most pediatricians, I am a true believer in the benefits of breast-feeding, though I myself was bottle-fed, along with many in my cohort (what can I say, I was born in the 1950s). But my own decision was mostly about that feeling that I had to un-hypocrite myself. Dr. Michael Kramer, a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at McGill University Faculty of Medicine, who was the lead author of a 2012 review of research on the optimal duration of exclusive breast-feeding, said that the case for exclusivity and longer duration starts with the realization that, \u201csome breast-feeding benefits are realized only during the time of breast-feeding.\u201d These include protection against infections and a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome, and the effects are stronger when the breast-feeding is exclusive. In poorer countries, Dr. Kramer said, breast-feeding children beyond 6 months leads to lower mortality rates. \u201cFor parents in a developed country, one of the main motivators is neurocognitive development, accelerated brain development,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know what it is about breast-feeding, whether it\u2019s something in the milk, whether it has to do with increased physical contact between lactating mother and nursing baby, or if just the time it takes to breast-feed means increased opportunities for verbal exchange between mother and baby,\u201d Dr. Kramer said. \u201cI think that is an interesting topic for future research.\u201d Dr. Kramer was the lead researcher on the Promotion of Breast-feeding Intervention Trial (Probit), which studied 17,000 mother-infant pairs in Belarus starting in the mid-90s and demonstrated these neurocognitive effects. Half of the mothers, who had all begun breast-feeding at birth, received additional support and encouragement to keep breast-feeding. In many past studies, it was hard to know whether some of the differences between breast-fed and bottle-fed infants could be attributed to other factors that affected who chose to breast-feed and who didn\u2019t. The Probit experimental design let researchers measure the effects of longer and more exclusive exposure to breast milk, and the results have helped shape recommendations from the World Health Organization and American Academy of Pediatrics. Dr. Maryam Sattari, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Florida, was the lead author of a 2016 study on the breast-feeding intentions and practices of 72 internal medicine physicians. The study found that 78 percent of the babies were exclusively breast-fed at birth and 40 percent of them at 12 months, though 63 percent of the mothers had planned to go to a year. \u201cThese are moms who are highly educated, highly motivated, they all want to do it,\u201d Dr. Sattari said. What helped these mothers, she said, was encouragement from medical leadership, as well as appropriate space and time to pump. The internists did better than the general population in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s breast-feeding report card on women in the United States breast-feeding babies born in 2013. While breast-feeding overall is on the rise, the numbers show that many mothers in this country are not following the A.A.P. recommendations. Compared to 2003, more women in 2013 were initiating breast-feeding (81 percent, up from 73 percent), and still breast-feeding at a year (31 percent, up from 20 percent). Cria Perrine, an epidemiologist in the C.D.C.\u2019s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity, said that those numbers don\u2019t show some of the differences between demographic groups; breast-feeding rates are lower among African-Americans and among low-income women. Our culture needs to do a better job of supporting women who breast-feed, she said. It\u2019s also really important not to make someone who can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t \u2014 like my own mother \u2014 feel like a bad parent. And it would be terrible to make someone who breast-feeds as long as she can feel that she has in some sense failed. We should be cheering mothers on, and acknowledging their choices. Dr. Julie Lumeng, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan, had her first child as a pediatric resident. She recalls that it was difficult to find the time that she needed for pumping, and that she knew that just mentioning it made some of her colleagues uncomfortable, even in pediatrics. Still, she was deeply aware of the pediatric recommendation and the need to live up to it. \u201cI would have stopped a lot earlier, but it was just not socially acceptable as a pediatrician among my peers to not be breast-feeding,\u201d she said. With my own third child, I made it to six months exclusively, me and my trusty electric breast pump. At times I felt I had gone a little off the deep end in my intense curation of those bags of frozen breast milk, carefully ferried to the day care center every day. It was a great relief when my son began avidly eating other foods, and it was then easier to go on breast-feeding him, evenings and weekends and whenever it made sense. We kept going till he was a little over a year old. The experience made me deeply aware of how much this advice I give is asking of women, and how hard it would have been to do this if my own life were less privileged and less well supported."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Story highlights Dementia is not a single disease but a complex problem with more than 50 underlying causes Most drug treatments in development target pathology of Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia Finding a cure for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's is challenging. They're difficult to diagnose, and drugs struggle to get into the brain as the brain's blood supply is largely separate to the rest of the body.  Not surprisingly, several companies have left this territory in recent years. Last week, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced it will stop research into developing drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, after costly failed attempts over the past decade. In recent years some clinical trials involving potential dementia drugs have had disappointing setbacks. In 2012, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson halted development of the antibody drug bapineuzumab, after it failed in late-stage trials to treat patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.", "Despite last week's announcement, Pfizer's support of the UK's Dementia Discovery Fund, an initiative involving the government, major pharmaceutical companies, and Alzheimer's Research UK, may be where their money can make the most impact in this space.  The fund aims to boost dementia research investment by financing early-stage drug development projects. And other pharma companies, such as Eli Lilly, Biogen and Novartis have continued to pursue dementia drug development with modest but promising success to date. Read More So what makes dementia such a difficult condition to treat with drugs, and is progress being made towards a treatment? Why dementia is so hard to treat Despite the vast number of people affected globally, with an estimated 46.8 million people currently living with dementia, there is currently no cure. While current treatments manage symptoms (the latest drug to gain FDA approval was memantine, in 2003) they offer no prospect of recovery.", "Part of the difficulty in finding treatments for dementia stems from the fact it's not a single disease, but a complex health problem with more than 50 underlying causes. Dementia can be better thought of as an umbrella term describing a range of conditions that cause parts of the brain to deteriorate progressively. Most drug treatments currently in development have targeted the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, which accounts for about 60 to 70% of all cases. Finding a successful treatment for Alzheimer's faces two major hurdles: the first being we still don't know enough about the disease's underlying biology. For example, we don't know what exactly regulates the toxic build-up of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and tau tangles in the brain that are found in Alzheimer's patients, which specific types of these are toxic, or why the disease progresses at different rates in different people.", "It doesn't help that symptoms of Alzheimer's develop gradually and slowly and a diagnosis might only be made years after the brain has started to undergo neurodegenerative changes. To boot, it's not uncommon for Alzheimer's to be present as well as other forms of dementia. The second major hurdle to finding a treatment is that drugs need to first cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier provides a defence against disease-causing pathogens and toxins that may be present in our blood, and by design exists to keep out foreign substances from the brain. The downside is that it also keeps the vast majority of potential drug treatments from reaching the brain. Promising steps in the right direction Currently available medications such as those which block the actions of an enzyme that destroys an important chemical messenger in the brain for memory (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) or blocks the toxic effects of another messenger, glutamate (memantine) temporarily manage symptoms. But new treatments are focused on slowing or reversing the disease process itself, by targeting the underlying biology.", "One approach, called immunotherapy, involves creating antibodies that bind to abnormal developments in the brain (such as amyloid-\u03b2 or tau), and mark them for destruction by a range of mechanisms. Immunotherapy is experiencing a surge of interest and a number of clinical trials -- targeting both amyloid-\u03b2 and tau -- are currently underway. Aducanumab, an antibody targeting amyloid-\u03b2, has shown promise in clinical trials and phase 3 trials are currently ongoing, as are several tau-based strategies. If any are successful, we would have a vaccine for Alzheimer's. It's estimated only 0.1% of antibodies circulating in the bloodstream enter the brain -- this also includes the therapeutic antibodies currently used in clinical trials. An approach my team is taking is to use ultrasound to temporarily open the blood-brain barrier, which increases the uptake of Alzheimer's drugs or antibody fragments. See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. We've had success in mice, finding ultrasound can clear toxic tau protein clumps, and that combining ultrasound with an antibody fragment treatment is more effective than either treatment alone in removing tau and reducing Alzheimer's symptoms. The next challenge will be translating this success into human clinical trials. The task of dementia drug development is no easy feat, and requires collaboration across government, industry and academia. In Australia, the National Dementia Network serves this purpose well. It's only through perseverance and continued investment in research that we'll one day have a treatment for dementia.

At a press conference on June 22, Haley called on legislators to vote to have the flag removed. Actions to have the Confederate flag taken down come in the wake of a shooting on June 17 in Charleston that left nine people dead. The victims were black, and the suspected gunman, 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof, was white. Officials have called the incident a hate crime. After the shooting, which took place at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, photos surfaced of Roof posing with the Confederate flag. Since then, there have been increased calls to remove the flag from the statehouse grounds because many consider it to be a racist symbol. The flag currently flies next to a memorial honoring those who served in the Civil War. State legislators will reconvene on Monday to consider legislation regarding the flag's removal.

Where are you on the curve?  (CNN) As safety concerns such as spinal injuries, concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy have emerged around college football and the NFL in recent years, some parents have questioned whether to start their kids in the beloved pastime.  But is that really keeping them away?  In 2016, an estimated 982,000 US children ages 6 to 12 were core participants in tackle football, according to a Sports and Fitness Industry Association survey conducted on more than 24,000 individuals and households.  The number includes any child, boy or girl, who has participated in tackle football 26 or more times a year, whether it is through football organizations, school or even pickup games, the association said.

(John Locher/AP)  Massive open online courses (MOOCs) were supposed to bring a revolution in education. But they haven\u2019t lived up to expectations. We have been putting educators in front of cameras and shooting video \u2014 just as the first TV shows did with radio stars, microphone in hand. This is not to say the millions of hours of online content are not valuable; the limits lie in the ability of the underlying technology to customize the material to the individual and to coach. That is about to change, though, through the use of virtual reality, artificial intelligence and sensors. Let me illustrate this with an imaginary school of the future in which Clifford is an artificial intelligence, a digital tutor, and Rachael is the human educational coach. Clifford has been with the children for years and understands their strengths and weaknesses. He customizes each class for them. To a child who likes reading books, he teaches mathematics and science in a traditional way, on their tablets. If they struggle with this because they are more visual learners, he asks them to put on their virtual-reality headsets for an excursion, say, to ancient Egypt. Watching the design and construction of the pyramids, children learn the geometry of different types of triangles and the mathematics behind these massive timeless monuments. They also gain an understanding of Egyptian history and culture by following the minds of the geniuses who planned and constructed them. Clifford also teaches art, music and biology through holographic simulations. By using advanced sensors to observe the children\u2019s pupillary size, their eye movements and subtle changes in the tone of their voice, Clifford registers their emotional state and level of understanding of the subject matter. There is no time pressure to complete a lesson, and there are no grades or exams. Yet Clifford can tell the parents how the child is doing whenever they want to know and can advise the human, Rachael, on what to teach. Rachael does not lecture or scrawl facts or equations on a blackboard. She is there to listen and help. She asks questions to help develop the children\u2019s values and thinking and teaches them how to work with one other. She has the responsibility of ensuring that students learn what they need to, and she guides them in ways Clifford cannot. She also helps with the physical side of projects, things made out of real materials rather than in mind and machine. With Clifford as teacher and Rachel as coach, children do not even realize that what they are undertaking is study. It feels like building cool stuff, playing video games, and living through history. Clifford, being software and having come into being in the same way that the free applications on our smartphones have, comes without financial charge. Rachael\u2019s coaching is part of our public education package, funded in the same way today\u2019s teachers are. We already have wonderful teachers who are supportive and can teach teamwork and values. Believe it or not, we have the ability to build Clifford today. The artificial intelligence tools and sensors to observe human emotion are commonly available via smartphones and digital assistants, and the virtual-reality headsets will soon be powerful enough and affordable enough for holographic learning. Take Facebook\u2019s Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. When Facebook released Oculus Rift in March 2016, it cost $599 and required a $199 controller and a $1,000 gaming PC. The headset and controller now cost $399 together and do the work of the gaming PC. Facebook says a new version, Oculus Go, will ship later this year and cost $199. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, HTC announced Vive Pro, a headset with much higher resolution and better features than Oculus Rift; and its price will surely be lower, because dozens of other companies, including Google, Lenovo and Magic Leap, are in also the race. We can expect that within two or three years, VR headsets will cost less than $100 and have built-in artificial intelligence chips, enabling billions of people to benefit from the education revolution finally at hand.

But I\u2019ve also been thinking a bit about economics, taking advantage of psychological distance to ruminate on stuff that isn\u2019t closely connected to the news. And one of the areas I\u2019ve been chewing over goes back to my old stomping ground of economic geography. In particular, I\u2019ve been trying to clarify my thoughts after reading Emily Badger\u2019s stimulating piece on how megacities seem to have less and less need for smaller cities. I found myself asking what might seem like an odd question: what, in the modern economy, are small cities even for? What purpose do they serve? And this question leads me to a chain of thought that\u2019s a bit different from Badger\u2019s, although not necessarily contradictory. Once upon a time, it was obvious what towns and small cities did: they served as central places serving a mainly rural population engaged in agriculture and other natural resource-based activities. The rural population was dispersed because arable land and other resources were dispersed, and so you had lots of small cities dotting the landscape. Over time, however, agriculture has become ever less important as a share of the economy, and the rural population has correspondingly declined as a determinant of urban location. Nonetheless, many small cities survived and grew by becoming industrial centers, generally specialized in some cluster of industries held together by the Marshallian trinity of information exchange, specialized suppliers, and a pool of labor with specialized skills. What determined which industries a small city developed? In some cases particular features of the location and nearby resources were important, but often it was more or less random chance at first, then a sequence in which one industry created conditions that favored another. So Rochester became a place where people knew about optics, presumably creating the preconditions for the rise of Eastman Kodak, and much later Xerox. This was typical of small industrial cities: even if what a city was doing in, say, 1970 seemed very different from what it was doing in 1880, there was usually a sort of chain of external economies creating the conditions that allowed the city to take advantage of particular new technological and market opportunities when they arose. Obviously, this was a chancy process. Some localized industries created fertile ground for new industries to replace them; others presumably became dead ends. And while a big, diversified city can afford a lot of dead ends, a smaller city can\u2019t. Some small cities got lucky repeatedly, and grew big. Others didn\u2019t; and when a city starts out fairly small and specialized, over a long period there will be a substantial chance that it will lose enough coin flips that it effectively loses any reason to exist. I\u2019m not saying that there weren\u2019t patterns of success and failure. Small cities were and are more likely to fail if they have miserable winters, more likely to come up with new tricks if they\u2019re college towns and/or destinations for immigrants. Still, if you back up enough, it makes sense to think of urban destinies as a random process of wins and losses in which small cities face a relatively high likelihood of experiencing gambler\u2019s ruin. Again, it was not always thus: once upon a time dispersed agriculture ensured that small cities serving rural hinterlands would survive. But for generations we have lived in an economy in which smaller cities have nothing going for them except historical luck, which eventually tends to run out. Notice, by the way, that globalization and all that isn\u2019t central to this story. If I\u2019m right, the conditions for small-city decline and fall have been building for a very long time, and we\u2019d be seeing much the same story \u2013 maybe more slowly \u2013 even without the growth of world trade. Are there policy implications from this diagnosis? Maybe. There are arguably social costs involved in letting small cities implode, so that there\u2019s a case for regional development policies that try to preserve their viability. But it\u2019s going to be an uphill struggle. In the modern economy, which has cut loose from the land, any particular small city exists only because of historical contingency that sooner or later loses its relevance.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)  For the third year in a row, police nationwide shot and killed nearly 1,000 people, a grim annual tally that has persisted despite widespread public scrutiny of officers\u2019 use of fatal force. Police fatally shot 987 people last year, or two dozen more than they killed in 2016, according to an ongoing Washington Post database project that tracks the fatal shootings. Since 2015, The Post has logged the details of 2,945 shooting deaths, culled from local news coverage, public records and social-media reports. While many of the year-to-year patterns remain consistent, the number of unarmed black males killed in 2017 declined from two years ago. Last year, police killed 19, a figure tracking closely with the 17 killed in 2016. In 2015, police shot and killed 36 unarmed black males. Experts said they are uncertain why the annual total shows little fluctuation \u2014 the number for 2017 is almost identical to the 995 killed by police in 2015. Some believe the tally may correspond to the number of times police encounter people, an outcome of statistical probability. Other experts are exploring whether the number tracks with overall violence in American society. \u201cThe numbers indicate that this is not a trend, but a robust measure of these shootings,\u201d said Geoff Alpert, a criminologist at the University of South Carolina who studies police use of force. \u201cWe now have information on almost 3,000 shootings, and we can start looking to provide the public with a better understanding of fatal officer-involved shootings.\u201d National scrutiny of shootings by police began after an unarmed black teenager from a suburb of St. Louis was fatally shot by a white police officer in August 2014. The death of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked widespread protests, prompted a White House commission to call for reforms, galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement and led many police agencies across the nation to examine their use of deadly force. The attention may have helped police reduce the number of unarmed people shot and killed each year, according to interviews with experts and police departments. Officers fatally shot 94 unarmed people in 2015, but that number has been lower in the past two years, with 51 killed in 2016 and 68 in 2017. \u201cThe national spotlight on this issue has made officers more cautious in unarmed situations,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based think tank. Wexler also said the training that his group developed for dozens of departments to de-escalate police encounters with civilians may be having an impact.", "San Francisco police investigate an officer-involved shooting in the city\u2019s Bayview neighborhood on Dec. 1, 2017. (KTVU-TV/Associated Press)  \u201cWe are giving officers more options like slowing the situation down and using time and distance to gain a tactical advantage,\u201d he said. While the number of black males \u2014 armed and unarmed \u2014 who have been killed has fallen, black males continue to be shot at disproportionately high rates, the data shows. Black males accounted for 22 percent of all people shot and killed in 2017, yet they are 6 percent of the total population. White males accounted for 44 percent of all fatal police shootings, and Hispanic males accounted for 18 percent.  Other patterns also held steady in 2017, according to The Post database. Police again most frequently used fatal force after encountering people armed with knives or guns, killing 735, a number nearly identical to the 734 armed people killed in 2015. The number was slightly lower in 2016, with 693 killed while armed with either type of weapon. White males continued to account for the largest group of people killed while armed with guns or knives, at 330 of those killed. Black males armed with guns or knives were fatally shot in 160 cases last year. Mental health again played an outsize role in the shootings: 236 people, or nearly 1 in 4 of those shot, were described as experiencing some form of mental distress at the time of the encounter with police. In the vast majority of those cases, 88 percent, the deceased people had wielded firearms or other weapons, including a machete, a sledge ax and a pitchfork. In November, Oklahoma City resident Dustin Pigeon, 29, threatened to set himself ablaze. A police officer shot Pigeon five times after he refused to drop a lighter and lighter fluid, according to prosecutors. In an unusual outcome, prosecutors charged the officer with second-degree murder in the death of Pigeon, saying that Pigeon was unarmed and had posed no threat to the officer. Mental-health advocates said they have been encouraged by the number of police departments that have created intervention teams to help people in mental distress but were dismayed at the persistence of the number killed. \u201cWe call 911 for other medical emergencies and they bring specially trained medical technicians, but when it\u2019s a mental-health crisis, we send the police,\u201d said Ron Honberg, a senior policy adviser at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, a grass-roots mental health-care advocacy group. Of all the people shot and killed by police in 2017, one of the youngest was 14-year-old Jason Pero from the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Tribe. In November, Jason called 911 to report a man with a knife and then gave a description of himself. Holding a knife, Jason lunged at a sheriff\u2019s deputy, who shot and killed him, according to news reports. The oldest person killed by police was 91-year-old Frank Wratny of Union Township, Pa., who was shot in March after he confronted police with a gun at his home. Police were responding to a 911 call from a woman who said Wratny had fired at her, according to news reports. Meanwhile, the number of police officers feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2017 stood at 46, a decline from the 66 recorded in 2016, according to the FBI. Since the shooting of Brown, some police departments said they have made headway in efforts to reduce the number of people they fatally shoot. In Los Angeles in 2015, the police department began to emphasize that officers should strive to preserve life in all encounters. Last year, the department began to award a preservation-of-life medal to an officer who makes great efforts to avoid a fatal shooting. The move was derided by local police unions. Top managers in the department said they think it has made a difference: Last year, Los Angeles Police Department officers fatally shot 15 people, down from 18 in 2016 and 21 in 2015.", "Los Angeles police officers observe a protest against the Trump administration in Los Angeles on Nov. 4, 2017. (Ronen Tivony/NurPhoto/Getty Images)  First Assistant Chief Michel Moore said the LAPD has provided officers with more training to emphasize de-escalation and has taken steps to hold officers more accountable. \u201cOur officers are in 1.5 million volatile encounters a year, so shooting someone is an incredibly rare event,\u201d Moore said. \u201cYet we pull each instance apart and see what factors might have played a role and train our officers to make that rare event even more rare.\u201d For a third consecutive year, The Post documented more than twice the number of deadly shootings by police that were recorded on average annually by the FBI. In response to the shooting data compiled by The Post and others, the FBI in 2015 promised to start better information gathering about all police encounters that lead to deaths. This month, the agency said it will launch the new nationwide data collection system. But the new system will have some of the same limitations that has led the government to annually undercount by half the number of fatal shootings by police. As before, data submissions under the new program will be voluntary. Ted Mellnik contributed to this report. Anthony is a fellow at the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University.

Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay", "\u2018Something from the cupboard\u201d was a regular meal when I was growing up. Our family home was in the countryside and a good distance from the shops, so going out in January to buy something fresh meant de-icing our old Nissan Bluebird that was so full of holes, eye-stinging wind would whip around our necks and freeze our fingers blue. The thought of something from the cupboard, then, was a source of great comfort, and a foil to our laziness, because it meant we didn\u2019t need to leave the house. Naturally, we spent a lot of time with our noses in the kitchen drawers, wondering how best to use tins of this and pots of spices, alongside stalwarts of the vegetable basket, and turn them into meals. Most of the time, this resulted in the same old things: spinach and sweetcorn saag (makai palak), plum tomato and chickpea noodle curry (sev tamatar) and dal dhokli (chickpea pasta poached in dal). But now that there is easy access to a more varied and global pantry, I tend to push the boat out and cook my way around south-east Asia on a regular basis: pad thai, laksa, penang curry and massaman curry share many ingredients in common \u2013 coconut milk, nuts, tamarind and galangal paste \u2013 as well as spices that keep for months, if not years. All are also forgiving enough to absorb most of our seasonal produce, while many of the base pastes can be made in a blender without a significant dent to flavour. Today\u2019s recipe is just such a dish. According to Thai food guru David Thompson, massaman curry has \u201call the hallmarks of southern Muslim food \u2013 rich with coconut cream and redolent of spices\u201d. There are many variations, but it\u2019s usually sweet, sour with tamarind and made using spices, peanuts and coconut; it also often features a starchy vegetable such as potato or sweet potato. Ordinarily complex to make, I\u2019ve taken liberties by using as many store-cupboard ingredients as possible. Sweet potato and aubergine massaman curry Feel free to play around with the vegetable element: potatoes, broccoli, carrots and radishes would all be at home here. Serves four. For the paste 5 red bird\u2019s-eye chillies 4 shallots, peeled and roughly chopped 2 lemongrass stalks, tough outer leaves removed, then roughly chopped 50g bunch coriander, leaves picked and set aside, stalks roughly chopped 100g (4\u00bd tbsp) smooth peanut butter  1\u00bd tsp ground cumin \u00be tsp ground cinnamon \u00bd tsp ground cloves 1\u00bd tbsp galangal paste 1\u00bd tbsp tamarind paste 2\u00bd tsp sugar  1\u00bd tsp salt For the curry  2 x 400ml tins coconut milk 400g aubergine, cut into 2cm x 2cm chunks 800g sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 3cm x 3cm chunks 1 handful dried coconut slices, to garnish  Put all the ingredients for the paste in a blender, add 100ml water and blitz to a paste. Put a large pan for which you have a lid on a medium heat and, once hot, fry the paste, stirring constantly, for five minutes, until dark and glossy; take care it doesn\u2019t catch and burn. Add the coconut milk little by little, stirring it into the paste as you go, then throw in the aubergine and bring the lot up to a bubble. Add the sweet potato, cover the pot, turn down the heat to a whisper and leave to cook for 20 minutes, until the aubergine has collapsed and the sweet potato is very tender. While the curry is cooking, toast the coconut slices. Put a small frying pan on a medium flame and, once hot, toast the coconut for a couple of minutes, until golden brown on both sides, then tip out on to a plate. To serve, transfer the curry to a serving bowl, scatter the coriander leaves and coconut slices on top, and serve with plain rice.

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)   Columnist November 4, 2016  They share ideas and ideology, friends and funders. They cross borders to appear at one another\u2019s rallies. They have deep contacts in Russia \u2014 they often use Russian disinformation \u2014 as well as friends in other authoritarian states. They despise the West and seek to undermine Western institutions. They think of themselves as a revolutionary avant-garde just like, once upon a time, the Communist International, or Comintern, the Soviet-backed organization that linked communist parties around Europe and the world. Now, of course, they are not Soviet-backed, and they are not communist. But this loose group of parties and politicians \u2014 Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the UK Independence Party, Hungary\u2019s Fidesz, Poland\u2019s Law and Justice, Donald Trump \u2014 have made themselves into a global movement of \u201canti-globalists.\u201d Meet the \u201cPopulist International\u201d: Whoever wins the U.S. election Tuesday, its influence is here to stay.  Although it is often described (by me and others searching for a shorthand) as \u201cfar-right,\u201d the Populist International has little to do with the \u201cright\u201d that has thrived in Western countries since World War II. Continental European Christian Democracy arose out of a postwar desire to bring morality back to politics; Gaullism came out of a long French tradition of statism and secularism; Anglo-Saxon conservatives had a historic preference for free markets. Most of them shared a Burkean small-\u201cc\u201d conservatism: a dislike of radical change, skepticism of \u201cprogress,\u201d a belief in the importance of conserving institutions and values. Most of them emerged out of particular local and historical traditions. All of them shared a devotion to representative democracy, religious tolerance, Western integration and the Western alliance.  By contrast, the parties that belong to the Populist International, and the media that support it, are not Burkean. They don\u2019t want to conserve or preserve what exists. Instead, they want to radically overthrow the institutions of the present to bring back things that existed in the past \u2014 or that they believe existed in the past \u2014 by force. Their language takes different forms in different countries, but their revolutionary projects often include the expulsion of immigrants, or at least the return to all-white (or all-Dutch, or all-German) societies; the resurrection of protectionism; the reversal of women\u2019s or minorities\u2019 rights; the end of international institutions and cooperation of all kinds. They advocate violence: In 2014, Trump said that \u201cyou\u2019ll have to have riots to go back to where we used to be, when America was great.\u201d Sometimes they claim to be Christian, but just as often they are nihilists and cynics. Their ideology, sometimes formalized and sometimes not, opposes homosexuality, racial integration, religious tolerance and human rights.  The Populist International holds these goals to be more important than prosperity, more important than economic growth, more important than democracy itself. Like the parties that once formed the Comintern, they are eager to destroy existing institutions \u2014 from independent courts and media to international alliances and treaties \u2014 to obtain them. This week, Britain\u2019s Daily Mail, a newspaper that propagates the ideas of the Populist International, actually denounced three high-court judges as \u201cEnemies of the People\u201d because they decreed that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union would require parliamentary consultation. Trump is only one of many politicians \u2014 Poland\u2019s Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban \u2014 who have launched attacks on the principles of their own constitutions.  Like their Comintern predecessors, the Populist International also understands that there is much to be gained by mutual support. German Christian Democrats would never have dreamed of campaigning on behalf of British Tories. And although they had much in common, Tories didn\u2019t intervene directly on behalf of U.S. Republicans. By contrast, Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, has openly campaigned for Trump, even appearing in a \u201cspin room\u201d to plug the Republican nominee after one of his debates with Hillary Clinton. Geert Wilders, the xenophobic Dutch politician, showed up at the Republican National Convention, where instead of observing, as a Dutch Christian Democrat would have done, he agitated on behalf of Trump, too. All of the populist parties and newspapers use the narratives put out by Sputnik, the Russian news service that serves as an endless source of conspiracy theories and fake news. This week, a fake account of a refugee in Austria acquitted of raping a child \u2014 originally broadcast on Russian state TV \u2014 was repeated by Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and then across Europe, including (again) in the Daily Mail.  All the signs are that the movement is still growing. If Trump loses, the story isn\u2019t over: His campaign will no doubt metastasize into a television channel and a news network, and will continue to spread. But his failure will encourage the antidotes \u2014 the citizens\u2019 parties, based on ideas rather than charisma, the independent journalists, the democracy movements \u2014 that have begun to emerge.  And if Trump wins? The Populist International will be invigorated, not just in the United States but around the world. Trump will be its leader, his daughter Ivanka will be its heir apparent, and liberal democracy, and the West as we know it, may cease to exist. Think about that before you vote."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Jon Cruz was a arrested Friday following an FBI investigation. He teaches social studies and coaches the debate team at New York City's Bronx High School of Science, where he has won multiple awards for distinguished service since 2006.  Colleagues interviewed by the New York Daily News were \"surprised\" to learn of the allegations. One debate coach, who did not want to be named, told the paper that \"no one ever heard anything untoward about [Cruz].\" On Friday, the FBI charged that Cruz allegedly used a photo of one of his former students as the profile picture on a text messaging app called Kik. He is accused of using the messenger to contact and coerce multiple victims into producing child porn. The FBI launched its probe of the teacher in December 2014 after the parents of one of the victims discovered their son's exchanges with the alias.  Authorities say Cruz contacted underage boys posing as a 15- or 16-year-old student at the Dalton School in New York City. He told his victims that he was a \"nerd\" with rich parents who \"had a thing for jocks,\" chatted with them about sex, and paid them money for nude photos, according to charging documents. One teen in New Mexico was paid $900 for pictures of his feet and face, and another received $1600 in gift cards in exchange for photos. Cruz sent a third victim $500 for nudes, and asked him to provide \"names of other boys who would chat,\" the documents said.  The New York Post quoted from Cruz's messages to victims: \"Pictures just have a huge impact on me. Seeing your feet and face and muscles and room and awards and stuff reinforces what a big deal you are,\" Cruz wrote, before asking if they can talk about sex. Cruz worked with children as part of his everyday duties at Bronx Science. The FBI investigation revealed that he paid a student for a non-nude photo. The Department of Education said that Cruz won't have further contact with students, and that they are cooperating with law enforcement.  \"It takes a special depravity to produce child pornography. This type of insidious behavior must stop,\u201d FBI Assistant Director in Charge Diego Rodriguez said in a news release. \u201cAnd others who think they can hide in the Deep Web or are beyond the reach of law enforcement should think again. Our youth deserve our unwavering commitment to their security, particularly from a coach and teacher at their school.\"  Cruz is held on $1 million bail."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

The terrorist attack on the satirical weekly in Paris threatens to create deeper animosities between Europe's growing Muslim minority and a native population that is increasingly embracing anti-Islam and anti-immigration movements. \"The radicals are trying to exacerbate tensions that are already there,\" said Jonathan Laurence, author of Integrating Islam: Political and Religious Challenges in Contemporary France. \"They're trying to drive a wedge between Muslims and the West.\" From France and Germany to Sweden and the United Kingdom, a backlash is spreading against Muslim immigrants, including tens of thousands of recent refugees from Syria's long civil war. In France, which has Western Europe's largest Muslim community, the anti-immigration National Front Party won 25% of the vote in the most recent elections in May, and radical anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim protests have taken place in multiple German cities in recent days. Until now, those and similar movements in other Western European countries have focused on limiting immigration and protecting the rights of publications to criticize Islam. They also have tried to halt what they view as excessive accommodations to Muslim culture: the use of Arabic language, headscarves worn by women, establishment of mosques, and serving halal food in school cafeterias. Wednesday's attack will provide a security element to those arguments, said Laurence, who teaches political science at Boston College. It \"ties a foreign threat of violence in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and Libya and brings it home and raises the conflict temperature to a dangerous levels within Europe,\" he said.

The attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, which poked fun at Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox Jewish clerics, fits into a pattern of radical Muslim reprisals against European critics in the world of culture.", "\"Kleine Zeitung\" from Graz, Austria. Newseum Last SlideNext Slide In 1989, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa (legal decree) calling for the death of author Salman Rushdie over his allegedly blasphemous portrayal of Islam's prophet Mohammed. Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered in 2004 for his film, Submission, about the treatment of women in Islam. And Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard escaped an assassination attempt in 2010 for his 2005 cartoon portrayal of the prophet, which caused riots and protests across the Muslim world. Thousands of Germans took part this week in anti-immigration rallies in Dresden, Berlin and Cologne, organized by a group known as PEGIDA, a German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West. Germany's political establishment, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, denounced the rallies as undemocratic and hateful. The group was started by PEGIDA leader Lutz Bachmann in October to protest plans to add 14 centers for about 2,000 refugees in Dresden. Demonstrators reject charges they are far-right extremists or neo-Nazis. They say they are concerned by an influx of 200,000 refugees in 2014, many from war-torn Syria. Similar sentiments have been expressed in Sweden by members of the far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats Party, which centrist parties sought to isolate and weaken last month by forming a broad parliamentary coalition. In France, the National Front Party headed by Marine Le Pen has gained support among working-class voters who believe the mainstream politicians have failed to address their concerns about crime, immigration and jobs. CLOSE", "Two masked attackers carrying machine guns and rocket launchers reportedly robbed a gas station 50 miles northeast of Paris on Thursday, prompting French authorities to investigate whether it was linked to the 'Charlie Hebdo' massacre. VPC \"There's a growing sense across France that immigration laws have been too weak,\" Gardiner said. He predicted that French officials would crack down on preachers of hate in radical mosques in Paris and other large French cities, and on French citizens seeking to fight with radical Islamist groups in Iraq or Syria. Whether that means far-right groups gain support depends on French President Francois Hollande's response, Gardiner said. France has been at the forefront of European nations in the fight against Islamist extremists in the Middle East and North Africa, focusing on its former 20th-century colonies. Hollande sent 3,000 troops to Mali to battle Islamist extremists who'd taken over a large swath of that former colony. He also joined the U.S.-led coalition launching airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. And on Monday, Hollande said he would strike at Islamist militants in Libya who try to cross or send weapons into neighboring Niger, where France has a base. France's domestic immigration issues also stem from its colonial past, including a civil war for independence from French control in Algeria that led to a flood of refugees into France in the early 1960s. \"France has this colonial legacy to deal with when negotiating the integration of the millions of descendants of these colonial subjects,\" author Laurence said. \"It's a political problem. What the violence does is prevent a political solution because it tends to polarize and make it appear the problem is not resolvable politically and can only be resolved militarily.\"", "CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDINEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Iv3U7w"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Medvedev is too small to overturn. It started right after he surrendered the Russian presidency to Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Putin reversed his predecessor\u2019s decision to decriminalize slander, made just eight months earlier. He raised the retirement age for top officials to 70, foiling Mr. Medvedev\u2019s attempt to \u201crejuvenate\u201d Russia\u2019s government by imposing an age limit of 60, or 65 in special cases. On Thursday, lawmakers began the process of revisiting yet another modest change from Mr. Medvedev\u2019s constrained presidency: his decision last year to end the practice of changing the time twice a year, moving Russia permanently to summer time. The bill\u2019s sponsor did not mince words, saying Mr. Medvedev\u2019s decision was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable for a huge part of\u201d Russia. Back in the days of the Soviet Union, journalists could tell a political figure had fallen out of favor by deciphering a sort of bureaucratic code: an article in Pravda would appear, pointing at \u201cdrawbacks\u201d in his rule, or his spot on the Red Square receiving line would drift toward the back. If it got really bad, he would be airbrushed out of group photographs. While it has not reached that point for Mr. Medvedev, the four and a half months since he left the presidency have brought a pointed departure from the course he set. The words \u201creset\u201d or \u201cmodernization\u201d are seldom mentioned, privatization of state-owned companies is in doubt and the direct gubernatorial elections Mr. Medvedev reinstated as a parting gesture have been weakened by the insertion of a Kremlin-controlled screening process for the candidates. Criticism of Mr. Medvedev has begun to appear in mainstream outlets. Thursday\u2019s news about the time change seemed like more of the same. \u201cSo in winter it will not get light an hour later, and in summer it will get dark an hour earlier \u2014 all this with only one goal: so that Mr. Medvedev, greeting the early dusk, will remember that he is nobody,\u201d wrote the journalist Mikhail Fishman on Facebook. To mark the occasion, the political consultant Gleb O. Pavlovsky coined the term \u201cde-Medvedevization.\u201d It is too early to write off Mr. Medvedev, who recently turned 47. He is now prime minister and remains the leader of the governing United Russia party and the second-most-important politician in the country. A year ago he demonstrated his loyalty to Mr. Putin by walking away from a second term, and Mr. Putin is known to reward loyalty. All in all, this summer felt less like a decisive change of course than a period of frenetic transition, without a clear plan waiting at the end. Still, there were unmistakable signs that Mr. Medvedev was being cut down to size, starting on the fourth anniversary of the August 2008 war with Georgia. That event had lifted his popularity greatly, and each anniversary he reminisced on television about the tough, solitary decision he made to send the army into Georgia while Mr. Putin was away in Beijing. This year\u2019s retrospectives were driven by the appearance of an anonymous documentary film in which retired generals excoriated Mr. Medvedev as timorous and cowardly. Mr. Putin, asked about the video, responded by turning Mr. Medvedev\u2019s narrative upside down, telling journalists that he had personally approved plans for the assault in advance, and that during the crisis he spoke repeatedly by phone to Mr. Medvedev and the Defense Ministry.", "Signs have emerged that Dmitri A. Medvedev, above, occasionally acted against the wishes of Vladimir V. Putin. Credit Pool photo by Dmitry Astakhov", "Another blow fell on Mr. Medvedev a few weeks later. While still president, he asked prosecutors to review the case of Taisiya Osipova, an opposition activist who had been sentenced to 10 years in prison on what her supporters said were fabricated drug charges. His complaint led to a reversal and retrial, in which prosecutors sought a more modest sentence of four years. In August the judge, in a highly unusual move, sentenced Ms. Osipova to twice that time. Alexander Rahr, a Russia scholar and author of a biography of Mr. Putin, said hard-liners around Mr. Putin blamed Mr. Medvedev for the burst of dissent that shook the Kremlin last winter. According to this critique, Mr. Medvedev\u2019s presidency ended the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d created during Mr. Putin\u2019s second presidential term. Though Mr. Medvedev did not push through significant structural change, influential insiders contend that he \u201ccreated an atmosphere\u201d that led to protests, Mr. Rahr said. \u201cThey are furious,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think Medvedev woke up this new Russian revolution.\u201d Konstantin Remchukov, the editor in chief of the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, says the political chill that set in this summer is familiar to anyone who grew up in the Soviet Union. He counted 30 months of easing political constraints, starting with the publication of Mr. Medvedev\u2019s essay \u201cForward, Russia\u201d \u2014 in essence, a critique of his predecessor\u2019s record \u2014 and ending with Mr. Putin\u2019s inauguration in May. \u201cWhen you have a situation more or less your whole life with very little periods of thaw, you can\u2019t treat it seriously,\u201d Mr. Remchukov said. \u201cI remember all these periods of being more warm, cooler, frosty.\u201d In a way, the biggest surprise is that Mr. Putin has found it necessary to roll back Mr. Medvedev\u2019s initiatives in the first place. For the four years of the \u201ctandem\u201d arrangement, the consensus among Western experts was that Mr. Medvedev did not do much without specific approval from Mr. Putin. On the day the two men announced they would switch places, a top Obama administration official shrugged off a query about whether this would herald a change of course in foreign policy: \u201cEveryone knows that Putin runs Russia,\u201d the official said. That seems less obvious now. Mr. Putin set about reviewing or reversing a long list of policies after his inauguration: relations with Japan and Belarus suddenly grew friendlier, for example, while relations with Ukraine\u2019s president, Viktor F. Yanukovich, took a dive. Igor Bunin, who leads Moscow\u2019s Center for Political Technologies, said that Mr. Putin had already reshuffled the Interior Ministry, moving several close friends of Mr. Medvedev\u2019s to advisory positions, and that the prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika, might be replaced for the same reason. All this suggests that many of Mr. Medvedev\u2019s initiatives toward the end of his presidency, sporadic and incomplete as they were, were undertaken independently, and in some cases against Mr. Putin\u2019s wishes. Though his talk about change was generally not accompanied by action, the Russian presidency is so powerful that for four years, Mr. Medvedev needed only to speak and the system began to work to promote his ideas. That time, however, is over. \u201cEven the time change; just everything Medvedev touched,\u201d Mr. Remchukov said. \u201cThis is the most sad story now, when I see that even minor things they are trying to eradicate from our reality.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on September 21, 2012, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Putin\u2019s Russia Punches the \u2018Clear\u2019 Button on the Medvedev Era."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will meet with President-elect Donald Trump this weekend, NBC News confirms.   Romney delivered a blistering takedown of Trump in a speech in March, calling the then-candidate \"a phony\" and \"a fraud.\" Trump has called Romney a loser and said he \"choked like a dog\" during his 2012 bid against President Obama.   A source close to Trump with direct knowledge of the president-elect's thinking confirms the meeting is to discuss the position of Secretary of State.   Trump endorsed Romney during his campaign four years ago. The former Massachusetts governor began to repair the relationship last week by calling to congratulate Trump on his surprise win.   President Obama on Thursday said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" about Donald Trump's presidency once the reality of his immense responsibilities sets in.   \"There's something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States, not just by its own people, but by people around the world that forces you to focus,\" Obama said during a press conference in Germany on Thursday.   \"If you're not serious about the job, then you probably won't be there very long because it will expose problems,\" Obama added.   The president added that he \"wouldn't advise\" those opposed to Trump to be silent or stop protesting, but said the election should be an important reminder about the importance of voting.   New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio visited Trump Tower on Wednesday for what he described as a \"candid and substantive dialogue\" with President-elect Donald Trump.   \"I let him know that so many New Yorkers were fearful, and that more has to be done to show that this country can heal and that people be respected,\" de Blasio told reporters following the meeting.   The Democratic mayor, who supported Hillary Clinton, said he and Trump discussed topics like immigration, Wall Street reform, taxes and the Republican's rhetoric. De Blasio also said he expressed concerns over Trump's decision to appoint former Breitbart News head Steve Bannon to a top White House post.   \"The balls in his court, people in this city and all over the country are looking to see what he's going to do,\" de Blasio said.   Republican Sen. John McCain on Tuesday warned against any attempt to reboot U.S.-Russia relations under Donald Trump's presidency.   \"With the U.S. presidential transition underway, Vladimir Putin has said in recent days that he wants to improve relations with the United States. We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections,\" the Arizona senator said in a statement.

An announcement could come out as early as tomorrow but more likely next week the sources said.   The inaugural committee is tasked with raising money for the inauguration beyond what the government allows. It also pays for balls, parties and events surrounding the event.   In 2008, President-elect Barack Obama placed a $50,000 limit on individual donors and banned contributions from lobbyists, corporations and super PACs. The committee also entertained no sponsorship agreements.   In 2012, President Obama loosened those restrictions and allowed for contributions from corporations but not from lobbyists or super PACs   The law allows unlimited contributions from corporations and U.S. permanent residents.   Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will meet with President-elect Donald Trump this weekend, NBC News confirms.   Romney delivered a blistering takedown of Trump in a speech in March, calling the then-candidate \"a phony\" and \"a fraud.\" Trump has called Romney a loser and said he \"choked like a dog\" during his 2012 bid against President Obama.   A source close to Trump with direct knowledge of the president-elect's thinking confirms the meeting is to discuss the position of Secretary of State.   Trump endorsed Romney during his campaign four years ago. The former Massachusetts governor began to repair the relationship last week by calling to congratulate Trump on his surprise win.   President Obama on Thursday said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" about Donald Trump's presidency once the reality of his immense responsibilities sets in.   \"There's something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States, not just by its own people, but by people around the world that forces you to focus,\" Obama said during a press conference in Germany on Thursday.   \"If you're not serious about the job, then you probably won't be there very long because it will expose problems,\" Obama added.   The president added that he \"wouldn't advise\" those opposed to Trump to be silent or stop protesting, but said the election should be an important reminder about the importance of voting.   New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio visited Trump Tower on Wednesday for what he described as a \"candid and substantive dialogue\" with President-elect Donald Trump.   \"I let him know that so many New Yorkers were fearful, and that more has to be done to show that this country can heal and that people be respected,\" de Blasio told reporters following the meeting.   The Democratic mayor, who supported Hillary Clinton, said he and Trump discussed topics like immigration, Wall Street reform, taxes and the Republican's rhetoric. De Blasio also said he expressed concerns over Trump's decision to appoint former Breitbart News head Steve Bannon to a top White House post.   \"The balls in his court, people in this city and all over the country are looking to see what he's going to do,\" de Blasio said.   Republican Sen. John McCain on Tuesday warned against any attempt to reboot U.S.-Russia relations under Donald Trump's presidency.   \"With the U.S. presidential transition underway, Vladimir Putin has said in recent days that he wants to improve relations with the United States. We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections,\" the Arizona senator said in a statement.

Donovan breaks down all the ways that Lopez is so much more than just her \u201cbeauty and booty\u201d in a poem titled \u201cMyQueen! JLo!,\u201d which the poet uploaded to YouTube on Sunday.

Lopez is a \u201clifeline of hope for people this country would rather kill off,\u201d the poet writes, referencing the highly criticized hurricane relief efforts by the Trump administration in Puerto Rico.  The poem says in part: Jenny, I\u2019m sorry that tabloids have always tried to erase your impact DailyMail miswrites your booty as the main attraction, and not just the tail of a lion. Like we get it! Even at 48, you\u2019re still a snack! But you\u2019re the mofongo and a glass of coquito too. Your beauty and booty are both captivating, like the telenovelas that our abuelas lived through. But they forget you floated from In Living Color Fly girl to an It Girl putting color where people were too comfortable with its absence. Caramel demanding to stick out in scenes that would rather settle for vanilla bean. You have become an American Idol and Latina dream; a crossover when they would rather divide us. The poet ends by calling Lopez \u201cBoricua royalty\u201d who shows Puerto Ricans they can \u201cmake waves while an entire country is waiting for you to drown.\u201d Lopez not only heard the ode but shared Donovan\u2019s poem on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter on Sunday night, writing that she was \u201chumbled and blown away...

Card 2 of 10  Why did the black community in Ferguson feel the need to protest? Card 3 of 10  What does race have to do with the Ferguson protests? Card 4 of 10  Why was Michael Brown shot? Card 5 of 10  What did the investigations into the Michael Brown shooting conclude? Card 6 of 10  What did the Justice Department's investigation into the Ferguson Police Department find?  In a searing report released in March 2015, the US Department of Justice uncovered a pattern of racial bias in the Ferguson Police Department. And it argued that the disparities could only be explained, at least in part, by unlawful bias and stereotypes against African Americans.  The disparities were rooted in the city's reliance on the police department and courts for local budget revenue: Federal officials found that city officials worked together at every level of enforcement \u2014 from city management to the local prosecutor to the police department \u2014 to make as much money from fines and court fees as possible, ranging from schemes to raise total fines for municipal code violations to asking cops to write as many citations as possible.  The report noted that, although black people made up about 67 percent of Ferguson's population, 88 percent of documented uses of force by Ferguson police from 2010 to August 2014 were against African Americans. In the 14 police canine bite cases for which racial data was available, the people bitten were black.  There were similar racial disparities in traffic stops. From 2012 to 2014, 85 percent of people stopped, 90 percent of people who received a citation, and 93 percent of people arrested were black. Black drivers were more than twice as likely as their white counterparts to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26 percent less likely to have contraband.  Some people's interactions with police turned downright abusive, as the report described: We spoke with one African-American man who, in August 2014, had an argument in his apartment to which FPD officers responded, and was immediately pulled out of the apartment by force. After telling the officer, \"you don't have a reason to lock me up,\" he claims the officer responded: \"N*****, I can find something to lock you up on.\" When the man responded, \"good luck with that,\" the officer slammed his face into the wall, and after the man fell to the floor, the officer said, \"don't pass out motherf****r because I'm not carrying you to my car.\" The Justice Department also exposed at least seven racist jokes police and court officials exchanged over email, all of which were sent by employees and were apparently sent during work hours. One of the emails, from November 2008, said President Barack Obama won't be president for long because \"what black man holds a steady job for four years.\"  The Justice Department found no evidence that any of the police and court officials who engaged in these emails were ever disciplined, although the officials involved lost their jobs after the investigation's findings were released. The investigation also found no indication that any official asked the sender to stop sending such emails, or any proof that the emails were reported. \"Instead, the emails were usually forwarded along to others,\" the report stated.  The emails show, as the Justice Department suggested, that at least some of the racial disparities in local law enforcement can be explained by outright racism. Card 7 of 10  Who is Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Michael Brown? Card 8 of 10  When can police officers use force? Card 9 of 10  What happened in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting and grand jury decision? Card 10 of 10  Why did police have military-grade equipment in the first place?"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

In a telephone interview early Friday, Chen said he does not blame American officials for his plight after leaving the U.S. Embassy under a deal they helped strike. But he accused Chinese officials of reneging on their promises to fully restore his freedom. A few hours later, he made a dramatic call into a congressional hearing, telling lawmakers in Washington through the cellphone of a human rights activist that he wanted to travel to the United States to rest and that he was most worried about \u201cthe safety of my mother and my brothers.\u201d Chen said he wanted to travel to the United States, but only temporarily, perhaps to study. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-time-only decision,\u201d Chen told the Washington Post from his hospital room. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t come back. As a free person, I believe I am endowed with the right to leave China when I want to and come back anytime I want.\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said Friday that if the well-known activist wanted to leave the country to study, he had to apply through the Chinese government like other ordinary citizens. \u201cChen Guangcheng is currently being treated in hospital,\u201d the spokesman, Liu Weimin, said in a statement. \u201cIf he wants to study abroad, he can apply through normal channels to the relevant departments, according to the law, just like any other Chinese citizen.\u201d With the fate of Chen and his family uncertain, the Obama administration drew sharp criticism Thursday for its handling of the crisis. U.S. officials expressed concern and frustration at not being able to meet with Chen. But granting him any assistance \u2014 much less safe passage to the United States \u2014 has grown far more complex and difficult since his departure from the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday, six days after escaping de facto house arrest in his village.  Once Chen left the sovereign soil of the embassy, the leverage of U.S. officials went with him. Now he is under the control of Chinese authorities, who on Thursday blocked all access to the activist.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t had either a diplomat or a doctor in to see him,\u201d said one U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be more candid. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of anxiety about what\u2019s going on.\u201d The official said that U.S. diplomats had extraordinary difficulties even trying to telephone Chen on Thursday and that their two calls with him were extremely brief, with one cut off after just seconds. Lacking direct access to Chen, U.S. officials met his wife, Yuan Weijing, outside the hospital. A senior State Department official said U.S. Embassy personnel again spoke with Chen and met with his wife late Friday morning. According to U.S. officials, Chen had previously insisted that he wanted to remain in China. But U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke said Thursday that \u201cit\u2019s apparent now that he\u2019s had a change of heart.\u201d  Chen, in the interview, clarified reports portraying him as pleading for asylum, insisting that he wants to travel to the United States only temporarily, retaining the freedom to return to China. Some Republicans and human rights advocates have accused the Obama administration of mismanaging Chen\u2019s case, saying it was too trusting of the Chinese government, given its history of mistreating dissidents. \u201cOur embassy failed to put in place the kind of verifiable measures that would have assured the safety of Mr. Chen and his family,\u201d said Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. \u201cIf these reports are true, this is a dark day for freedom, and it\u2019s a day of shame for the Obama administration.\u201d \u2018Substantial\u2019 fallout For China, the crisis falls into an ongoing struggle between increasingly visible reform-minded moderates within the Communist Party and hard-liners who emphasize security and stability at any cost. Some analysts saw Chinese officials\u2019 quick acceptance of Wednesday\u2019s deal as a sign of the reform faction\u2019s sway. In many ways, China\u2019s apparent willingness to give assurances to a foreign country about how it would treat one of its citizens was exceedingly rare. But the deal\u2019s rapid unraveling could, instead, boost hard-liners. \u201cThe collateral damage here is substantial,\u201d said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cIf there was a debate on the Chinese side on whether to negotiate, this certainly isn\u2019t good for those who pushed for the deal.\u201d At the hospital Thursday, police harshly treated journalists and a small number of Chen\u2019s supporters who tried to see him in his first-floor room. On Friday, more supporters reported being beaten and detained by police for going to the hospital to try to visit Chen. Security officials also reportedly took away government-issued press cards from some journalists who tried to enter the hospital. On Friday, police were taking down the names and press card information from reporters who gathered outside the hospital.  Du Yanlin, an accountant and tax consultant for the dissident artist Ai Weiwei, said he tried to visit Chen around 1 p.m. Thursday but was turned away by plainclothes police officers. After he and his friends posed for a photo in front of the hospital wearing sunglasses like Chen\u2019s, Du said, police followed him home and questioned him for \u201cmaking trouble.\u201d Jiang Tianyong, a human rights lawyer, described in an interview how he went to Chaoyang hospital to try to see Chen around 6 p.m. Thursday, but was immediately hustled into an unmarked car by about 10 plainclothes officers from Beijing\u2019s Haidan district public security branch. Jiang said the agents took him to a hotel room where they first repeatedly insulted and berated him, and then one \u201csuddenly jumped on me and punched me heavily three times, on my left ear, my right ear and my chest. I instantly felt a severe hearing loss.\u201d Jiang said he could barely hear, but they told him \u201cThe Chen Guangcheng incident is a big matter, not a small matter.\u201d Jiang said the policemen refused his repeated requests to go to a hospital; instead, they made him strip from the waist up and stand in the cold air of an air conditioner turned on full blast. He said he was taken home only around 3 a.m. Friday, and is now under effective house arrest with a police car parked outside his apartment with four or five officers waiting. Apparent change of heart Chen\u2019s case overshadowed Thursday\u2019s opening of a two-day U.S.-China summit that included Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.  Both sides were careful not to mention Chen\u2019s case specifically. But from his isolated hospital room, Chen still managed to thrust himself into the center of the stage-managed diplomacy when he told interviewers that he wanted to fly to the United States with Clinton when she leaves Saturday. U.S. officials and analysts, however, said privately that that appeared unlikely, given the significant political, diplomatic and legal hurdles, including Chen\u2019s lack of passport or visa. The activist\u2019s apparent change of heart about where he wants to live has made the tense diplomatic episode especially difficult. More details emerged Thursday about what might have prompted his abrupt shift. From the time he entered the fortified U.S. Embassy compound on April 26, Chen insisted that he wanted to remain in China and be reunited with his wife, said Locke and other officials. Under the original deal reached with Chinese officials, according to U.S. diplomats, the self-taught lawyer was to be allowed to move his family to the Beijing area and begin a new life as a university student. But after Chen was taken in an embassy van to Chaoyang Hospital, he had his first extended telephone conversations with friends and allies, as well as his attorney, Teng Biao. Teng later posted the transcript of his Wednesday conversation with Chen on his Twitter account, in which he told Chen about the arrest of his relatives and some activists who aided in his escape from his farmhouse in Shandong province. Teng then asked Chen whether any U.S. diplomats remained with him at the hospital.  \u201cNo, they\u2019ve all gone,\u201d Chen replied, according to the transcript. \u201cThey said they would accompany me all the way, but now they\u2019ve all gone.\u201d Teng said, \u201cThen you\u2019re in a really dangerous situation!\u201d In his brief interview early Friday, Chen sounded relaxed and full of energy \u2014 a sharp contrast to interviews Thursday, when he was reported to have sounded frightened. He said that he was being treated well at the hospital and that he, his wife and their two children were left alone together in one room. But he said armed thugs have taken over his farmhouse in Dongshigu village, and he was concerned about other members of his family, with whom he has not been able to speak. \u201cMy biggest wish right now is that the agreement concerning me is fulfilled well,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThe agreement includes more than three points, including the U.S. side being able to visit me regularly, and China should guarantee my rights as a citizen.\u201d Authorities crack down Rights activists say the moves to isolate Chen and round up activists who assisted him suggest that Chinese authorities never intended to honor their agreement to treat Chen humanely and allow him to live freely in a new and safe location in China. Instead, many of his supporters have been harassed, and there has been a near-total blackout of all references to Chen on China\u2019s popular Twitter-like microblogging sites. Even his initials, \u201cCGC,\u201d and terms such as \u201cblind man,\u201d the name of his town, \u201cLinyi,\u201d and even the prison escape movie \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d were banned Thursday. Still, some of Chen\u2019s supporters made their way to the hospital. Liu Caiping, 38, said she arrived just after noon Thursday and was accosted by a plainclothes guard, who seized her cellphone. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Chen Guangcheng. I just heard about him last year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite upsetting to see all the people who struggle for human rights in China are all getting forced out. He can play a bigger role in China.\u201d She then took out a pair of sunglasses like Chen\u2019s and had her picture taken as a show of support.

Pundits from across the political spectrum are suddenly wrestling with the question. Derek Thompson at the Atlantic started things off by suggesting there was a \"doom loop\u201d of liberalism \u2014 a widespread trend in Western nations that should cause significant concern: Education and feminism lower fertility, and so countries turn to immigration to make up the difference in the labor force. As the number of immigrants increases, it becomes harder to integrate them, which gives rise to blowback populism.  Ross Douthat of the New York Times fired back, respectfully suggesting that secular liberal societies could incentivize fertility of native citizens by deploying some fairly minor policy tweaks, including bigger financial incentives for childbearing \u2014 and by promoting different family norms, like increased involvement in religious communities.  And now Bryce Covert, writing from a feminist perspective, has written an op-ed for the Times that tackles the issue from a slightly different angle, arguing that the Trump administration\u2019s curtailment of access to free contraception could have serious, negative economic consequences as women shift from jobs to child-rearing. The reality of declining fertility turns out to be quite complex. To begin with, it should be noted that while fertility declines in the 20th century were driven by a mix of improved contraception and declining desired fertility, 21st-century declines have occurred with virtually no correspondent decline in women's\u2019 desired number of children: Women in America continue to report wanting to have more children than they in fact have, and the number has not declined very much in this century; indeed, they desire well above replacement-level amounts of children. But we don\u2019t make it easy for them to act on that desire. Far from a simple story of secular societies liberating women from the onerousness of child-bearing, declining fertility in post-industrial societies is also a story of disappointed hopes. (The story in developing countries is quite different.) The shortfall in fertility is growing. Now these \u201cmissing kids\u201d are becoming nearly as numerous as unintended births.", "Higher fertility would be good, but it\u2019s hard to achieve If we take the expressed desires of American families seriously, and especially the desires of American women, then we need to find a way to help them achieve their goals. Financial incentives, it turns out, are not highly effective. Studies find that policies that encourage parental leave or offer financial subsidies to parents require lots of money for small fertility gains. Likewise, many conservatives wrongly believe that banning abortion or restricting contraceptives might boost fertility, but the best evidence suggests such restrictions have at best weak impacts, at least in developed countries. Cultural forces, meanwhile, can be extremely powerful but are difficult to engineer, especially in big, culturally pluralistic societies like the United States. Douthat\u2019s preferred prescription (and my own), that people should be more religious, may have a very limited impact. Even societies with high religiosity, such as in Africa or much of Eastern Europe, have seen falling birth rates. This decline in religious countries (including where religiosity is stable or rising!) is surprising, because religious groups tend to place a high priority on family, children, and multi-generational living. But the fertility-suppressing forces of modern economies appear to be even more influential.  In a low population growth society, inequality is more easily entrenched, parental wealth more easily passed on to heirs, new startups are less able to expand rapidly, and declining generational cohort sizes reduce the need for certain classes of labor (child care and education most notably). The logic is not entirely intuitive, but a declining population means the employed share of the population must rise to maintain existing economic functions, and productivity per worker must rise to maintain output. Yet for more than a decade productivity growth in the developed world has been low and the employed population share has been stagnant or falling.  A low population growth environment means the economic pie grows slower too \u2014 which means, in the long run, that wealth consolidates. And in the very long run, we miss out on potential Mozarts, Washingtons, and Edisons.", "It shouldn\u2019t be immigration versus fertility. Let\u2019s increase both. Both Thompson and Douthat rightly see a threat in low population growth, but each focuses on just one side of the problem. Douthat, for example, would have us all have more babies to avoid the need for immigrants. But so long as American values of pluralism, integration, and personal liberty persist, we will need immigrants to fill a vital role in our cultural milieu. Plus, boosting fertility is going to have to be a long-run play: In the short run, US population growth persistently undershoots forecasts. Even if you\u2019d prefer Douthat\u2019s approach, in the abstract, we need immigration to rise from its presently quite low levels to stave off short-run population strains.  No serious population growth agenda for America can lean on just fertility to accomplish its goals, at least not if it wants to avoid serious short-run economic crises and preserve traditional American values, which are inseparable from openness to immigrants. Thompson, meanwhile \u2014 while arguing that integration of immigrants gets harder as births make up a smaller and smaller share of population growth \u2014 skips over the sources of those low birth rates. He devotes no time to considering whether, perhaps, we might benefit from making some political, economic, and cultural adjustments to empower women and families to have the kids they want to have. Given how dire his forecast is, it is genuinely perplexing that he basically ignores pro-natal policies.  What we really need is a political movement in favor of population growth from all sources. We need policies that remove fiscal penalties for marriage and encourage marital stability, that recognize the service parents do for society, and that subsidize childbearing and child-rearing accordingly \u2014 even if, on their own, such policies won\u2019t restore us to stable fertility levels. We need new cultural norms that make our society more family-friendly. And we need cultural leaders to set an example, have kids, and promote childbearing and parenting.  Proposals for a pro-population growth agenda What kinds of policies might help? Replacing the estate tax with a per-heir \u201cinheritance\u201d tax would encourage wealthy people to have children and also to break up their estates, killing two birds with one stone. Expanding existing tax credits for children, and consolidating complex child tax provisions into one larger benefit, would help ease parents\u2019 budgets \u2014 even more so if refundability were expanded (or if credits came by monthly check).  And we could get even more creative: Should rent control be adjusted for family size? Should bigger families get to cut in lines? Should minivans with car seats get special parking places akin to those for disabled people? Should families with at least four kids be given a public honor or award and a meeting with their senator or governor? Many countries have tried such social or cultural policies: Sometimes they have an effect, often they don\u2019t, but as part of a wide basket of political and social changes, they may be useful. Here\u2019s an idea that\u2019s even more out there. Since traditional agricultural societies enabled parents to \u201ccapture\u201d the economic rents of childbearing because families shared income, the economic returns to childbearing were large. This remains true in developing countries where family networks share incomes, including through migrant remittances, but it\u2019s not true in America. We can fix that. We could set a small payroll tax on each person, and allocate it to their parent (with exclusions for cases of abuse or neglect, of course). Such a \u201cparental dividend\u201d would alter the long-run financial calculation of parenting.  We might also consider higher Social Security payouts, in their retirement years, for people who had more children. And let\u2019s not forget \u201cpersonal\u201d policies. If getting ahead in your industry requires happy-hour drinks three nights a week, that\u2019s unfriendly to families and may be preventing your female colleagues from having the family they want. Check your childlessness privilege. If you never volunteer to babysit your friends\u2019 kids, but expect to benefit from their Social Security taxes, you\u2019re a societal free-rider. If your social activities require your friends to get babysitters because your house isn\u2019t kid-friendly, then make your house kid-friendly. There\u2019s no way to legislate such behavior; that would be totalitarian. But we can each voluntarily change our behavior. Meanwhile, we need to continue our traditional American immigration policy, meaning an open hand to anyone who will work hard and integrate into American life. We should accept more immigrants, even as we stiffen requirements to learn English. We should accept more refugees, even as we prioritize pro-integration resettlement policies like requiring refugees to participate in native-majority, English-language-using social organizations. Contra the Trump administration, we should expand the \u201cdiversity\u201d visa category massively, seeking immigrants from unusual locations who, the research suggests, integrate faster: But we should screen them for personality characteristics that indicate personal flexibility and preference for diversity, which the research also suggests boosts integration.  More babies, more immigrants, more integration. This will yield an America that is larger, stronger, richer, more diverse, and more American than ever.

This is the second WNBA franchise to put up for sale in the past few months. San Antonio was bought by MGM Resorts International and the team was moved to Las Vegas. That franchise will begin play next season and is coached by Bill Laimbeer, who left the Liberty last month. New York promoted assistant coach Katie Smith to the head job. While all of the eight original WNBA franchises were owned and affiliated with NBA teams, only three of the 12 teams now have NBA partners \u2014 Indiana, Phoenix and Minnesota. \"The Liberty is a WNBA original with a history of great players and fans,\" WNBA President Lisa Borders said. \"We thank MSG for its 21 seasons supporting the growth of women's basketball and appreciate its dedication to find a new ownership group to build on the team's successes for many seasons to come.\" New York has reached the playoffs in 15 of its 21 seasons but has never won the title. It has had the best record in the Eastern Conference the past three seasons. Led by Tina Charles, the Liberty were 22-12 this past year and were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs. The team was fourth in attendance this season, averaging 9,889 fans, with attendance growing 8 percent over the last three seasons under team president Isiah Thomas. \"This was a difficult decision for us, which we made after carefully assessing the needs of our business,\" Dolan said. \"We are confident that new ownership can build on the foundation we established over these last 21 years, and steward this incredible franchise into an even more successful future.\" Dolan lauded Thomas for expanding sponsorships, increasing the fan base and developing a team for the long term. \"The Liberty now presents a tremendous opportunity for a new owner to bring new resources, creativity and focus to ensure the team becomes an enduring success,\" Dolan said. Dolan's group also owns the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. Thomas is a former Knicks president and coach and his move to the WNBA came against a contentious backdrop of his time with the NBA club. Ten years ago, while the Knicks coach, a jury ruled Thomas sexually harassed a former team executive, and the Garden improperly fired her. A court ordered the Knicks and Dolan to pay $11.6 million, with the settlement at $11.5 million. In 2015, the WNBA and Liberty suspended Thomas' bid for partial ownership of the Liberty.

Among those who support views of limited government, there is often a \"higher than average endorsement of views that could be seen as racial resentment,\" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. \"What this reflects is that there are groups of people who have not been accepted by politically correct circles and have never learned to frame their comments in a palatable fashion.

They are a minority viewpoint, but they are a large minority.\" And that's put politicians who have previously embraced men such as Bundy, Nugent and Robertson as cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bres in an awkward position.

But his election is a warning sign about the state of American democracy. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  According to many of its critics, the Trump administration represents the greatest challenge to American liberal democracy in decades. Trump regularly bemoans the independence of the Department of Justice, demonizes the press for running critical or unflattering stories, and speaks admiringly of foreign authoritarian rulers. A year into his tenure, he has pushed aside long-standing norms meant to limit presidential self-dealing and conflicts of interest. Some believe that Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice for firing FBI director James B. Comey over the bureau\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. His first two \u201cMuslim bans\u201d were struck down as unconstitutional; the status of the third remains pending. Critics charge that the Trump administration\u2019s rhetorical attacks on nonwhite immigrants \u2014 especially when combined with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s aggressive deportations \u2014 suggest a playbook long associated with ethno-nationalist demagogues. But what kind of a threat does Trump really pose? What does Trump stand for, and how should we best categorize Trumpism? Is he an authoritarian, a demagogue, a fascist, a white nationalist, an ethno-nationalist, a kleptocrat, a right-wing populist \u2014 or, befitting his beverage preferences, an embodiment of fascism-lite? This isn\u2019t just partisan name-calling. Very serious scholars have entered the public sphere to argue, say, that Trump isn\u2019t a fascist but, rather, a right-wing populist. Last week, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), in a speech that criticized Trump for his attacks on the press, even likened the president, a member of his own party, to Joseph Stalin. On the scale of autocrats, Stalin takes us straight to 11: He occupies a rarefied place in the evils of the 20th century, along with the likes of Pol Pot and Adolf Hitler. Stalin\u2019s name conjures up the Great Terror, the Holodomor and, notably, totalitarianism. Indeed, Trump\u2019s election spurred renewed interest in Hannah Arendt\u2019s \u201cThe Origins of Totalitarianism.\u201d Recently, John Stoehr wondered whether \u201cwe are approaching an inflection point beyond which we won\u2019t be arguing, when it will be plain to everyone, not just the president\u2019s detractors, that Trumpism is totalitarianism\u2019s cousin.\u201d That kind of rhetoric, along with more straightforward comparisons of Trump to Hitler and Stalin, is threat inflation. Totalitarianism is one of those concepts that eludes simple definition. This is one reason that it has fallen in and out of fashion among political scientists. But it\u2019s generally associated with the subordination, or elimination, of most of civil society in favor of the state, itself run by a single party. So the more totalitarian the system, the less it tolerates independent trade unions, corporations, religious institutions and the like. (Thus the \u201cweaknesses\u201d of civil society in the immediate wake of communist regimes in Eastern and Central Europe.) In China, businesses are \u201crequired by law to establish a party organization,\u201d and there are some indications that the government is giving this requirement greater teeth. There\u2019s simply no indication that Trump, or his allies, want, or even dream of, anything along these lines. Why does that matter? I share worries about the effect of the Trump administration on American (and global) democracy. But describing the threat Trump poses in ways that he cannot possibly meet makes it harder, rather than easier, to strengthen American liberal democracy and guard against backsliding. True, Trump shows little intrinsic regard for democratic norms, values and institutions. Many Americans familiar with the rhetoric and tactics favored by leaders of authoritarian and hybrid regimes find the president and his administration deeply disquieting. But optimists, whether Trump supporters or the president\u2019s more sanguine opponents, are right to point out that the American elections in 2017 were as free and fair as they were in 2016; the judiciary still has acted to check the executive branch; our libel laws remain the same; and plenty of functioning democracies adopt much more restrictive immigration policies than does the United States. In fact, current trends point toward a brutal 2018 for Republican officeholders. This hardly seems the stuff of authoritarianism, let alone totalitarianism. Still, the real fear is that democratic institutions can seem robust until they collapse. Each encroachment, especially if accomplished under the cloak of formal legitimacy, can be waved away; norms, once breached, can be difficult to put back into place. Pessimists point to Hungary\u2019s self-proclaimed illiberal democracy or Turkey\u2019s slide into de facto dictatorship. This suggests a dilemma. Hype the threat too much, and you risk discrediting the cause. Downplay the threat, and risk standing by while the bottom falls out. It doesn\u2019t help matters that we really have little idea why Trump has failed to make good on his rhetoric. It might be the strength of institutional checks, the presence of \u201ccooler heads\u201d that keep him under control, his personal incompetence or a general lack of seriousness behind his threats and boasting. But, at some basic level, it is deeply irresponsible to simply dismiss the threats and boasts of the president. Trump, though, did not appear in a vacuum. His very election is itself a warning sign about the state of American democracy. It slots into a broader narrative of years of democratic backsliding and the erosion of institutional norms. Among the other warning signs: attempts to restrict the franchise in the name of fighting voter fraud; the attempts to insulate governing parties against the will of voters; the rise of strong partisanship and weak parties; and the rise of zero-sum politics in which power, and total policy victories, are more important than governance. It is easy to dismiss these as examples of \u201chardball politics,\u201d but scholars of democracy recognize them as indicators of democratic erosion. Many (but not all) of these symptoms are more advanced among Republicans than Democrats, which also makes them matters of partisan politics \u2014 and hence politicizes the maintenance and consolidation of democracy. This last development is, in the context of democratic backsliding, particularly dangerous, because it translates loyalty to party into opposition to liberal democratic norms and processes. The debate isn\u2019t just a matter of contextualizing Trump in terms of post-Cold War trends. Left wing critics of \u201cliberal alarmism\u201d point out, quite rightly, that the United States is, by many standards, a more consolidated democracy today than in past periods. Voter fraud may be trivial now, but it wasn\u2019t for much of American history. Are you worried about the abuse of domestic police powers? How about J. Edgar Hoover? Or Richard Nixon? Can anyone honestly say that current attacks on voting rights are remotely comparable to the systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans before the 1965 Voting Rights Act? Heck, from the end of Reconstruction to the end of Jim Crow, much of the United States consisted of racial authoritarian enclaves. And how does Trump\u2019s travel ban stack up against Japanese American internment during World War II, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s current crackdown measure up against Operation Wetback? When contemplating America\u2019s history of illiberalism, racism and oppression, would you like some ethnic cleansing of Native Americans, as well as some chattel slavery, on the side? By the implicit standards sometimes used by Trump\u2019s critics, the United States wasn\u2019t even a liberal democracy until fairly recently. Some hold up this history to argue that focusing on Trump distracts us from more dangerous, and more insidious threats to American democracy. Others point to it as a reason for optimism. American democracy survived much worse than Trump, so get a grip. But, in fact, it is precisely the opposite: It\u2019s reason for deep concern. It demonstrates that there\u2019s no \u201cspecial sauce\u201d that insulates the United States from autocratic policies, kleptocracy and zones of outright authoritarianism. Many look back fondly on past periods of American prosperity and global power. Trump built his campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d around this nostalgia. But as critics argued during the 2016 campaign, the America that Trump invoked could be a brutal place for ethnic and religious minorities, people who violated prevailing gender norms and sexual morality and those accused of communist sympathies. This kind of selective tyranny, in fact, is endemic to autocratic and hybrid regimes. As Thomas Pepinksy writes, \u201cEveryday life in the modern authoritarian regime is \u2026 boring and tolerable. It is not outrageous. Most critics, even vocal ones, are not going to be murdered \u2026 they are going to be frustrated.\u201d There\u2019s no need to invoke the specter of Stalin or Hitler. Here in the United States, we know where democratic backsliding can lead, because, in a sense, we\u2019ve already been there.

Redskins insider Lake Lewis touched on several hard-hitting points in Friday\u2019s article on the Michigan State product. One thing for certain is it is not a wise decision to handicap the franchise by signing Cousins to a lucrative contract that could stunt the success the Burgundy and Gold have had in putting together a talented roster. It\u2019s very clear for the Redskins and across the National Football League that solid quarterbacks aren\u2019t easy to come by. But it has been proven in the past years of Redskins glory and the winning ways of other franchises around the NFL that if you build up the trenches with solid talent and depth, the wins will come. Just look at the Minnesota Vikings and the Jacksonville Jaguars as examples of recent success. Both teams possess top 10 offensive and defensive units. Having dominant front lines reduces the chances of a teams deficiencies being exposed by the opponent especially at the quarterback position. Washington\u2019s offensive line has been solid and continues to get better, with a few additions to the unit they could be a dominating force for years to come. Most importantly though is the defensive front line, especially, in the middle of the unit. With the addition of a bonafide stud in the middle along with some solid rotational guys to add along with the talent they have, Greg Manusky\u2019s unit could be on the verge of being a top ten defense. But all these things are just good talking points around the water cooler if they overspend for a quarterback that has put up wonderful statistical numbers. Cousins has broken most if not all of the franchise\u2019s QB records, but the most important records are wins and losses and that\u2019s a stat that isn\u2019t so favorable for the Holland Christian High School star. The 2018 playoffs have shown that it\u2019s not all contingent on quarterback play. If the Redskins continue to build on a solid foundation the structure of this team will continue to flourish. But if compromised by paying a high price for a good but not elite quarterback, it could keep the franchise at what has been its status quo of continually missing the mark. Like this article?

She was about six weeks along and went out for pizza. She didn\u2019t feel great, but she managed to eat a slice or two. The next day, everything changed. Every single food she put in her mouth came right back up. Every single smell made her nauseated.  Johnson went to her doctor for answers and was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), a condition marked by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dehydration during pregnancy. Johnson had them all. Two weeks after she was diagnosed, she was hospitalized for severe dehydration. Soon after she went into the hospital again, this time staying for almost a month. Johnson eventually required a home nurse who helped her get all of her nutrition intravenously, and was hooked up to a portable pump that gave her a constant stream of anti-nausea medication. She did not consume any actual food for more than a month. \u201cI remember one day I got back from the grocery store and I was so weak, all I could do was get to the front door. Then I crawled to the bathroom and laid there \u2015 after dry heaving \u2015 with my cheek on the tile floor,\u201d she recalled. \u201cTwo hours later, that\u2019s how my husband found me. The door to the house was wide open. The car door was open. He saw my feet hanging out the door and thought I was dead.\u201d Hyperemesis gravidarum is back in the news with the announcement that Kate Middleton \u2015 the world\u2019s most famous HG sufferer \u2015 is pregnant with her third child and once again struggling with the condition, cancelling planned appearances and missing the first day of school with her son on Thursday. While Middleton has done more than just about anyone to draw attention to HG, some are still quick to dismiss her diagnosis as nothing more than an overblown excuse to lay low. \u201cWhy the fuss over morning sickness?\u201d said one commenter on The Daily Mail. Headlines and articles have unwittingly downplayed the seriousness of HG by labeling it \u201csevere morning sickness.\u201d People have this notion that everbody exaggerates everything, but in this situation you don't have to exaggerate. It's as bad as you can imagine. But as the harrowing pregnancies of moms like Johnson make clear, describing HG as simply a more intense version of the nausea and vomiting most pregnant women encounter is not only dismissive; it\u2019s potentially dangerous. And it means that many moms-to-be end up suffering alone. \u201cYou just want to yell at people, \u2018It\u2019s not the same!\u2019\u201d Johnson said. \u201cPeople have this notion that everybody exaggerates everything, but in this situation you don\u2019t have to exaggerate. It\u2019s as bad as you can imagine.\u201d NOT morning sickness Soon after the latest royal pregnancy was announced, HuffPost Parents posted a callout on its Facebook page looking for women willing to talk about their experiences with HG. Within 24 hours, more than 100 e-mails poured in. Women called themselves \u201cHG survivors\u201d and described battles with extreme weight loss and vomiting more than 20 times a day. Again and again they emphasized one point: Morning sickness and HG are not the same thing. Certainly morning sickness \u2015 which affects roughly 70 percent of moms in the first trimester \u2015 can be hard, but it\u2019s generally not harmful for women or their babies and tends to fade. HG, on the other hand, absolutely puts women and babies at risk. These are the moms-to-be who vomit more than three to four times a day, who are unable to keep down any food and who lose more than 5 percent of their pre-pregnancy weight. The Oregon-based Hyperemesis Education and Research Foundation (HER) says these women tend to have nutritional deficiencies and metabolic imbalances that can be life-threatening. I honestly thought we were dying. I'd cry, but was so dehydrated I had no tears...I was vomiting so hard I hit my head on the toilet and passed out. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest feelings to describe,\u201d a mom who was hospitalized 14 times in the first half of her pregnancy wrote in an e-mail to HuffPost. \u201cFeeling like you\u2019re going to die at any given moment is an understatement. It literally changes your life \u2014 being so tired your muscles hurt, so dehydrated your head pounds non-stop, getting so used to throwing up you can feel it a mile away.\u201d \u201cI honestly thought we where dying,\u201d another wrote. \u201cI\u2019d cry, but was so dehydrated I had no tears. At one point I was vomiting so hard I hit my head on the toilet and passed out.\u201d That woman lost her job and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Carla Rose, 30, a single mother of now 1-and-a-half-year-old twins, told HuffPost that she was forced to go to the hospital two to three times a week to get IV nutrition and fluids. Early on in her pregnancy, she was vomiting more than 20 times a day. By her second trimester, Rose was on a cocktail of medication that limited her vomiting to five or six episodes daily, but she never reached a point when she was not regularly throwing up. At 25 weeks, she went on complete bedrest and took leave from her teaching job after passing out in the classroom. She was so weak, she often relied on a wheelchair to get around. \u201cThe only thing you can think about is how terrible you feel,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI would live on the bathroom floor because I could not stop vomiting. I was literally green. Like, people would come up to me and say \u2018Your skin color is green.\u2019\u201d \u201cMy girls are beautiful and healthy,\u201d she added, \u201cbut they ate me alive.\u201d No clear answers Current estimates suggest that between 0.3 and 2.3 percent of all pregnant women experience HG, though it\u2019s possible the numbers are higher because some women don\u2019t seek treatment for it. The HER Foundation\u2019s executive director Kimber MacGibbon, a registered nurse and an HG survivor herself, told HuffPost the site gets half a million visitors every year and has more than 13,000 followers on Facebook.  The hormones associated with pregnancy \u2015 namely estrogen \u2015 are thought to play a key role, though MacGibbon told HuffPost researchers are increasingly interested in the role that genetics play. A 2010 study also found that HG may be hereditary to some degree, but the exact causes remain unknown. MacGibbon did note that having a seemingly healthy (and obviously privileged) woman like Kate Middleton become the public face of HG has at least helped debunk the notion that it\u2019s caused by women not taking care of themselves or looking to get attention.  It\u2019s really impossible for a woman without complications to comprehend the turmoil we live through. Treatment options do exist \u2015 generally through IV nutrition and fluids, as well as prescription anti-vomiting medications \u2015 but full relief isn\u2019t on the table. The goal is to keep mom and baby safe from serious complications like low birth weight, thyroid and liver problems and the kind of severe dehydration that can hospitalize women for weeks on end. \u201cYou can treat it, but treatment doesn\u2019t equal zero symptoms,\u201d MacGibbon said. About half of women find their symptoms subside by the time they\u2019re midway through their pregnancy, while the rest struggle the whole time. But women in both groups say the memories of HG \u2015 of hour upon hour spent vomiting on the floor, or finishing a pregnancy weighing less than they did when it began \u2015 stay with them for a long time.  Take Robyn, a 47-year-old who asked that only her first name be used, who vomited violently throughout all three of her pregnancies, but had particularly severe HG with her second in 1991. She had to carry around a bucket for her spit because she threw up every time she swallowed. More than 20 years later, she can still recall how she would dry heave for 15 minutes at a stretch, breaking all of the blood vessels in and around her eyes. Or how she\u2019d sit helplessly with her head over a bucket, letting her saliva stream down so she wouldn\u2019t have to throw up again. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone truly understands it unless they live it or live with a woman who has it,\u201d Robyn said. \u201cIt\u2019s really impossible for a woman without complications to comprehend the turmoil we live through.\u201d", "6 Unexpected Ways Your Body Changes After Pregnancy  1 / 6  You can't seem to get rid of your belly It's no surprise that for many women, muscles in their abdomen separate to accommodate the baby. The thing is, it can stay that way after birth. When the bands of muscles, which run parallel down your belly, separate, they leave behind a space in between, a condition called diastasis recti. Without the ab muscles in the middle of your belly to hold everything in, you might see a bulge or ridge of soft tissue there, aka a pooch that just won't go away. In fact, one-third of women still had it even one year postpartum, reported a  in the . \"Some women are alarmed that they can lean forward or do a sit-up and see this bulge in between these muscles,\" explains Jonathan Schaffir, MD, an ob-gyn at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Though weak ab muscles can lead to back pain, in general they don't cause medical issues. Exercise is often recommended\u2014some studies show that moves targeting deep ab muscles called the transverse abdominal muscles (like bird-dogs and pelvic tilts) may help\u2014however, the jury is still out on exactly what you need to do or how much it speeds healing, suggests a  analyzing eight studies. Unfortunately, there's no slam-dunk treatment, hence why in severe cases some women correct the condition with surgery. mediaphotos/iStock"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

We knew this beforehand, of course... Ecuador was featured on International Living's annual retirement index that year.

It's something we sit down with and pore over, circling this ranking, underlining that score, comparing and contrasting potential retirement destinations like we'd compare and contrast toys and tools in that catalogue.

The bizarre amalgam of biblical birth, Nordic folklore, and vast commercial exploitation is a dizzying onslaught of the senses and sensibilities alike, devastating everything in its path.  If the carnage of the Christmas assault does not leave you a bit dizzy, you must not be paying attention. We are invited to memorialize the humble home-birth of Jesus in Bethlehem with a giant conifer in Rockefeller Center. We are called upon to reassert our fealty to peace, goodwill, and the human community, while obligated to vituperate and if necessary trample those particular humans who stand between us and the thing we must buy for the person who certainly doesn\u2019t need it and might not even want it. Christmas is a crisis; the quintessential dangerous opportunity. It is our chance to let dance the better angels of our nature, or to mortgage both nature and the angels to buy whatever invention of Madison Avenue is parent to our newest ephemeral necessity. It is all about giving, yet it is the big take- and everyone is seemingly in on it. Christmas always makes me think about the oddest of couples: humanity and industry, commerce and community, the ties of family and the tales of folklore. And this particular year, I cannot help but view it all through the lens of #MeToo. The deep rot of far too many #MeToo\u2019s draining at last from a cultural abscess left far too long to fester in the dark has something jarringly in common with the crass commercial rot of how Christmas is exploited. That something is: taking.  As a preventive medicine specialist, I am natively inclined to think past effects to causes. I completed my preventive medicine training in 1993, the year a seminal research paper entitled Actual Causes of Death in the United States was published. That perspective has owned me ever since. I never thought best attempts at putting Humpty Dumpty back together were good enough; I always saw the need for a seat belt on that wall, or a well-padded landing. There are far too many #MeToo\u2019, among those both famous and intimately familiar. We are, I think, obligated to ask not just \u201cwho next?\u201d but \u201cwhy?\u201d Why is this violation of autonomy and dignity as pervasive as it is pernicious? How do we put a stop to it at its origins? Digging past consequences to causes, I find myself hitting two layers of bedrock. The deeper one is all about the biology of sex, the mating imperatives of mammals, and the promptings of selfish genes. The one just above, however, is more interesting; it is where we can take a stand, and make decisions. It is about cultural priorities, and behavioral imperatives. #MeToo is the result of unrightful taking. It is about exploitation and abuse of power. It is the translation of the routine, grammatical conflation of \u201ccan\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d into the violations that ensue when capacity qualifies as permission.  #MeToo is about sexual harassment, mostly of women by men, at the level of effects; but it must be about more at the level of causes. Taking takes many forms where it originates in causes, as others have vividly conceived. The clamor of so many #MeToos tells us how men take from women, or other men, or maybe rarely, vice versa. But #MeToo echoes into expanses beyond the personal space of sexual improprieties. I recall the comment of an ethicist to the audience at a conference I helped organize at Yale many years ago: \u201cyour right to swing a stick ends where my nose begins.\u201d There is nothing sexual about that; it is more universally true. There is a universal primacy to autonomy and dignity. There are universal limits to our entitlements. We defy these at our peril, and to our shame. Haves take from have-nots. Power takes its every advantage. Humans take and take again far beyond the planet\u2019s capacity to give. We take space that costs other species their existence. We take trees that impoverish the lungs of the world. We take from aquifers that will parch the throats and parcels of our neighbors, and our heirs. We are eating our children\u2019s food. We are ravaging the oceans. Even as the North Pole takes its seasonal place in our communal fantasy, we are melting it. Men and women alike, we are takers, in a season of taking partly disguised as giving, maybe unable to tell the difference. As trees die, biodiversity declines, and California burns- the business of Christmas as usual might invite a timely reckoning, but thus far, our culture sanctions it all. Our culture keeps selling this taking, and we keep buying. Perhaps if we are to answer the challenge of #MeToo, we must question how so many of our sons learned to believe that wanting was the only license taking ever required.  The #MeToo conversation is obviously fraught, and thus prone to devolve into discord about details even among those who mostly agree. The latest argument seems to be over whether the harassment of unwelcome sexual attention is absolute, or comes in shades of gray. Perhaps the matter of intention makes a case for both. I suppose I cannot know for sure how someone, woman or man, will perceive it if I place my hand on their shoulder, and give a gentle squeeze, intending to say: thank you, I appreciate you. Shades of gray might shroud the first step down a slippery slope. But I certainly can know if I meant to give, not take. I can know that I meant only to convey warmth and gratitude. I can only hope to convey my intention, but I can know what I intended. Perhaps accordingly the shades of gray transgressions, and the absolute distinction between intentions to give or take can coexist. We live in a culture that measures worth in wealth and power rather than deference and decency. We live in a culture that implies our entitlements to take and take some more, with little thought of consequences. We live in a culture murmuring we may, if we can. But we are captains of our own souls, and masters of the metrics that tell us what matters. Where the licentious taking from so many #MeToo\u2019s confronts the gratuitous giving of Christmas-as-commerce, we have many reasons to heed the lyrical imperatives: peace on earth, good will toward men- and women. Respect for one another, our common humanity, our shared and fragile home. Perhaps that\u2019s where shades of gray meet absolutes, and where the #MeToo movement can meet its match in 2018. Would you take what is not rightfully yours; what is not offered; what will deprive or defile another? #MeNeither. -fin"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

The tactics -- which one official described Friday as a threatened execution -- were used on Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, according to the CIA's inspector general's report on the agency's interrogation program. Nashiri, who was captured in November 2002 and held for four years in one of the CIA's \"black site\" prisons, ultimately became one of three al-Qaeda chieftains subjected to a form of simulated drowning known as waterboarding.   The report also says that a mock execution was staged in a room next to one terrorism suspect, according to Newsweek magazine, citing two sources for its information. The magazine was the first to publish details from the report, which it did on its Web site late Friday.   A federal judge in New York has ordered a redacted version of the classified IG report to be publicly released Monday, in response to a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. Since June, lawyers for the Justice Department and the CIA have been scrutinizing the document to determine how much of it can be made public. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has been weighing the report's findings as part of a broader probe into the CIA's use of harsh interrogation methods.   The IG's report, written in 2004, offers new details about Nashiri's interrogation, including the incidents in which the detainee reportedly was threatened with death or grave injury if he refused to cooperate, one current and one former U.S. official told The Post. Both officials have seen classified versions of the report.   In one instance, an interrogator showed Nashiri a gun and sought to frighten the detainee into thinking he would be shot, the sources said. In a separate encounter, a power drill was held near Nashiri's body and repeatedly turned on and off, said the officials, who spoke about the report on the condition of anonymity because it remains classified.   The federal torture statute prohibits a U.S. national from threatening anyone in his or her custody with imminent death.   Three months before Nashiri's capture, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel -- Jay S. Bybee, now a federal judge -- advised the CIA in an August 2002 memo that threats of \"imminent death\" were not illegal unless they deliberately produced prolonged mental harm. Independent legal experts have called that interpretation too hedged and thus too lax.   The CIA declined late Friday to comment on the contents of the report, but an agency spokesman noted that all the incidents described in the document have been reviewed in detail by government prosecutors.   \"The CIA in no way endorsed behavior -- no matter how infrequent -- that went beyond formal guidance,\" said the spokesman, Paul Gimigliano. \"This has all been looked at; professionals in the Department of Justice decided if and when to pursue prosecution. That's how the system was supposed to work, and that's how it did work.\"   Nashiri, who remains in U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was the alleged mastermind of the 1999 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors and nearly sank the vessel. Before his capture by CIA officers, he allegedly headed al-Qaeda's operations in the Persian Gulf, and he was the most senior member of the terrorist organization in U.S. custody at the time of his arrest.   The IG's report is the most comprehensive, contemporaneous review of the secret CIA interrogation program, which ran from early 2002 until September 2006. Controversial within the spy agency, it criticized the CIA's use of coercive interrogation methods, warning that several likely violated international bans on cruel and inhumane treatment.   A third former U.S. official who has read the full, classified report said that it contained an entire section listing ways in which the CIA and contracted interrogators had \"gone beyond what they were authorized to do -- a whole variety of deviations.\" The official said that what struck him most strongly was that the report suggested these techniques were \"really not effective.\"   He said he concluded that \"there has to be a better way to do this\" but that the CIA resisted suggestions then that it should back away from the program. Asked why, the official said he could not say for sure, but he added that \"maybe it was that if you change, then it means you were wrong\" in pursuing the harsh interrogation methods in the first place.   A former senior agency official, intimately familiar with the program and the report, said that individual interrogators who strayed outside the agency's guidelines were promptly disciplined, and that, in some instances, their cases were referred to Justice Department prosecutors.   \"Any infractions of the rules were met with anger at CIA because we realized this was a program that had to stay meticulously within the guidelines,\" the official said. He noted that after the IG's report was completed in 2004, the document was reviewed by administration and congressional officials, who allowed the program to continue despite its flaws.   \"A reaffirmation of both administration policy and [Justice] legal authorization was sought and eventually received,\" the official said.  \u00a9 2009 The Washington Post Company"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Russian chemist Constantin Fahlberg was eating dinner when he made an amazing discovery: The roll he'd just bitten into tasted extremely sweet. Realizing the sugary, metallic taste had come from his own hands, he rushed back to the lab to find the source. After tasting everything in sight -- not exactly good lab safety protocol -- he discovered the sweetness came from an accidental chemical reaction between coal tar derivatives (yum!), producing benzoic sulfinide. That's one version of the story. Another account says Fahlberg's American boss, Dr. Ira Remsen, was the diner who forgot to wash up before eating. Regardless, it was Fahlberg who applied for a patent for saccharin as an inexpensive sugar substitute  Hide Caption  2 of 10", "Where do we stand on artificial sweeteners? 1900: Poison Squad eats food heavily laced with saccharin \u2013 In the early 1900s, a group of civil servants was given free room and board if the men would eat food heavily laced with widely used chemical preservatives, including borax and saccharin.

Cyclamate was linked to bladder, urinary, lung, stomach and reproductive tumors in the rodents.  While later studies found the bladder issues were due to parasites and other urinary peculiarities unique to rats, the damage was done. The FDA banned cyclamate in 1970. While 100 other countries have declared cyclamate safe and use it in their food, the FDA ban remains in the United States.

When cyclamate was banned, the makers of Sweet'N Low quickly switched to an all-saccharin version, but suspicions remained about saccharin's role as a carcinogen in rats. In 1977 Congress decreed that any food sweetened with saccharin must carry a scary warning label: \"Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals.\"  More studies disproved the connection and in 2000, Congress removed the warning label.

Schlatter was looking for an anti-ulcer drug when he stumbled upon the sweet taste of aspartame by (you guessed it) licking his finger. A mix of aspartic acid and phenylalanine, two naturally occurring amino acids, aspartame entered the growing artificial sweetener market in 1973. Today it's sold as Equal, Nutrasweet or Sugar Twin. Unlike the other artificial sweeteners, which are usually excreted unchanged, aspartame can be metabolized, so it does have minimal calories (about 4 per gram). It also has some known uncommon health concerns. It should not be used by anyone with the genetic disorder phenylketonuria or certain rare liver disorders, or pregnant women with high levels of phenylalanine in their blood, because it doesn't metabolize properly in those individuals. The FDA requires any food made with aspartame to put that restriction on the label.

So it was a shock when researchers at the University of Texas found that conventional wisdom was wrong, when they analyzed eight years of data from the San Antonio Heart Study. The more diet sodas a person drank, the more likely he or she was to gain weight.  To this day, no one knows why. Was it due to the artificial sweetener? Was it something else in the soda? Does drinking a diet soda make it more likely a person might order a double size burger and fries?  Oh, and for the record, a 2013 review says there is still evidence that diet soda helps with weight loss.  Hide Caption  9 of 10", "Where do we stand on artificial sweeteners? 2012: Artificial sweetners probably safe, but some lingering health concerns \u2013 Studying the effects of specific artificial sweeteners is a challenge in today's world, as many soda and food manufacturers create mixtures of sweeteners to mimic sugar and make their products taste unique. So it's hard to tease out which of the sweeteners might be a problem. But studies continue to find concerns that bear watching. A 2008 study found drinking more than two servings of diet soda a day doubled the risk for kidney decline in women. A 2012 study suggested a possible connection between diet sodas and an increased risk for vascular events. And several studies have discovered a link between metabolic syndrome -- a sort of prediabetes -- and Type 2 diabetes, perhaps because it alters people's gut bacteria.

Credit Lior Mizrahi/Getty Images", "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday that a new United States Embassy to Israel would open in Jerusalem before the end of 2019. Mr. Pence\u2019s statement, made to the Israeli Parliament during a trip to the Holy Land, follows President Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital last month, a move that overturned decades of American policy and international consensus on the status of the holy city. Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital or believe it should be divided, with East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a Palestinian state. The international consensus, previously supported by the United States, has been that the city\u2019s status can be determined only through negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Mr. Trump has said that the embassy\u2019s move to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv should not hamper peace talks. He says he is working on a \u201cdeal of the century\u201d that will resolve the conflict, although few details have been released. Advertisement Mr. Trump has also threatened to shutter an office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Washington, and cut American donations to the United Nations agency that provides services for Palestinian refugees. In a statement on her Facebook page, Israel\u2019s culture minister, Miri Regev, called Mr. Pence \u201ca very welcome guest here\u201d and thanked him and Mr. Trump for endorsing the Israeli claim to Jerusalem and for cutting funding for the United Nations agency. \u201cTruth must be said and the truth is that Israel and Jerusalem belong to the Jewish people,\u201d Ms. Regev wrote. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, will not meet Mr. Pence. He has called Mr. Trump\u2019s Jerusalem declaration \u201ca slap in the face.\u201d Mr. Pence is an evangelical Christian who has spoken of protecting Christian minorities in the Middle East but who been widely shunned by those same Christians for his embrace of the Israeli position on Jerusalem. No Arab Christian leaders have agreed to meet with him during his visit, and he is not scheduled to visit Christian holy sites like the city of Nazareth, the West Bank town of Bethlehem or the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where tradition holds that Jesus was crucified. Mr. Pence canceled his last planned trip to the Holy Land before Christmas after Christian Arab leaders declined to meet with him."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Wray speaks at an event at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington on Jan. 15. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)   January 22 at 11:22 PM  FBI Director Christopher A. Wray has been resisting pressure from Attorney General Jeff Sessions to replace his deputy director Andrew McCabe, a frequent target of criticism from President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter. The tensions over the issue of McCabe, and other high-level FBI officials who served during James B. Comey\u2019s tenure at the FBI, have bubbled up to the White House, where counsel Donald McGahn has sought to mediate the issue, these people said. As Sessions tried to push Wray to make personnel changes, Wray became increasingly frustrated and conveyed that frustration to the attorney general, these people said. The attorney general then discussed the matter with McGahn, who advised Sessions to ease back on the issue, which he did, these people said. One person familiar with the discussions said Wray has not discussed FBI personnel matters with the president, but in December, after The Washington Post reported that McCabe planned to retire in March when he became eligible for his full pension benefits, the president quickly tweeted out criticisms of McCabe, a target of his since the 2016 election campaign. Much of the discussion between Wray and Sessions about housecleaning at the FBI also came in December, according to people familiar with the matter. Axios was first to report the Session-Wray dispute on Monday evening and said that Wray had threatened to resign as FBI director if Sessions did not stop pressuring him to fire McCabe. But several people familiar with the dynamic told The Post that they were not aware of such an explicit threat by Wray. Firing McCabe outright could be legally problematic \u2014 he has limited civil service protections as a government employee, and firing him in the aftermath of such public criticism from the president and others could prompt litigation. Spokesmen for the FBI and Justice Department declined to comment. White House spokesman Raj Shah praised Wray in a written statement, while attacking other senior FBI officials. \u201cThe President has enormous respect for the thousands of rank-and-file F.B.I. agents who make up the world\u2019s most professional and talented law enforcement agency. He believes politically motivated senior leaders, including former Director Comey and others he empowered, have tainted the agency\u2019s reputation for unbiased pursuit of justice,\u2019\u2019 said Shah. \u201cThe president appointed Chris Wray because he is a man of true character and integrity, and the right choice to clean up the misconduct at the highest levels of the F.B.I. and give the rank and file confidence in their leadership.\u201d Generally, Wray has sought to avoid the drama and personal confrontations that sometimes flare up inside the Trump administration. In both his public comments and private remarks to FBI personnel, Wray has signaled that staffing decisions are his to make, and that he intends to wait for the ongoing inspector general\u2019s investigation to reach some conclusions before making major personnel decisions involving people under scrutiny in that investigation \u2014 a category that includes McCabe. Sessions, Republican lawmakers and some members of the Trump administration have been arguing for weeks that Wray should conduct some kind of housecleaning at the senior ranks of the FBI by demoting or reassigning senior aides to his predecessor, Comey, according to people familiar with the matter. These people added that Sessions himself is under tremendous political pressure from conservative lawmakers and the White House, who have complained that the bureaucracy of federal law enforcement is biased against the president. Wray became FBI director in August, taking the helm of the nation\u2019s premier law enforcement agency at a turbulent time \u2014 under frequent attack from congressional Republicans and occasionally the president, and facing a wide-ranging internal investigation into how it handled politically sensitive probes into presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The president fired Comey in May, leading to the appointment a week later of a special counsel to investigate Trump and his associates for possible election-season coordination with agents of the Russian government. The probe is also trying to determine whether the president or any White House officials sought to obstruct justice leading up to Comey\u2019s firing. On Monday night, Comey appeared to cheer the news that Wray was standing up to the administration, tweeting: \u201cGood to read reports of people standing up for what they believe in.\u201d Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.

That\u2019s the inherent nature of the recruiting process, with the Warriors one of six teams wooing Durant in free agency back then in the hope that he would help them win it all. But as we were reminded last week, when Durant and Draymond Green had a heated discussion about a late-game situation in a loss against the Memphis Grizzlies, the time for ego boosting is gone now that the title push is in full effect. With three months to tinker before the postseason arrives, and the memory of their NBA Finals failing last June still fresh, these are the kinds of tough talks that might help them maximize all that talent on the loaded roster.

We know who\u2019s coming in.\u2019 It\u2019s been a ton (compared to last season) \u2013 it\u2019s really been all experimenting, for the most part.

That\u2019s what makes him an incredible star. He\u2019s a megastar. You know, most people would look at how you\u2019re saying something and not what you\u2019re saying.

And yet, I saw something that said, \u2018Draymond and Kevin gets into an argument,\u2019 or something.

The find may suggest that Homo sapiens first migrated out of Africa at least 50,000 years earlier than previously thought. Credit Gerhard Weber, University of Vienna", "Scientists on Thursday announced the discovery of a fossilized human jawbone in a collapsed cave in Israel that they said is between 177,000 and 194,000 years old. If confirmed, the find may rewrite the early migration story of our species, pushing back by about 50,000 years the time that Homo sapiens first ventured out of Africa. Previous discoveries in Israel had convinced some anthropologists that modern humans began leaving Africa between 90,000 and 120,000 years ago. But the recently dated jawbone is unraveling that narrative. \u201cThis would be the earliest modern human anyone has found outside of Africa, ever,\u201d said John Hawks, a paleoanthropologist from the University of Wisconsin, Madison who was not involved in the study. The upper jawbone \u2014 which includes seven intact teeth and one broken incisor, and was described in a paper in the journal Science \u2014 provides fossil evidence that lends support to genetic studies that have suggested modern humans moved from Africa far earlier than had been suspected. \u201cWhat I was surprised by was how well this new discovery fits into the new picture that\u2019s emerging of the evolution of Homo sapiens,\u201d said Julia Galway-Witham, a research assistant at the Natural History Museum in London who wrote an accompanying perspective article. Dr. Hawks and other researchers advised caution in interpreting the discovery. Although this ancient person may have shared some anatomical characteristics with present-day people, this \u201cmodern human\u201d would have probably looked much different from anyone living in the world today. \u201cEarly modern humans in many respects were not so modern,\u201d said Jean-Jacques Hublin, director of the department of human evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. Dr. Hublin said that by concluding the jawbone came from a \u201cmodern human,\u201d the authors were simply saying that the ancient person was morphologically more closely related to us than to Neanderthals. That does not mean that this person contributed to the DNA of anyone living today, he added. It is possible that the jawbone belonged to a previously unknown population of Homo sapiens that departed Africa and then died off.", "The Misliya Cave in Israel, where the fossil was found in 2002 by an archaeology student on his first dig. Credit Mina Weinstein-Evron, Haifa University", "That explanation would need to be tested with DNA samples, which are difficult to collect from fossils found in the arid Levant. The upper jawbone, or maxilla, was found by a team led by Israel Hershkovitz, a paleoanthropologist at Tel Aviv University and lead author of the new paper, while excavating the Misliya Cave on the western slopes of Mount Carmel in Israel. The jawbone was discovered in 2002 by a freshman on his first archaeological dig with the group. The team had long known that ancient people lived in the Misliya Cave, which is a rock shelter with an overhanging ceiling carved into a limestone cliff. By dating burned flint flakes found at the site, archaeologists had determined that it was occupied between 250,000 to 160,000 years ago, during an era known as the Early Middle Paleolithic. Evidence, including bedding, showed that the people who lived there used it as a base camp. They hunted deer, gazelles and aurochs, and feasted on turtles, hares and ostrich eggs. Dr. Hershkovitz and Mina Weinstein-Evron, an archaeologist at the University of Haifa, felt that the jawbone looked modern, but they needed to confirm their hunch. Dr. Hershkovitz has made similar findings in the past. In 2015, he announced finding a 55,000-year-old skull in the Levant. But a 2010 discovery of 400,000-year-old teeth in Israel in which he participated received criticism for how it was reported in the media. To test their suspicions about the jawbone, the archaeologists sent the specimen on a world tour. \u201cIt looked so modern that it took us five years to convince people, because they couldn\u2019t believe their eyes,\u201d said Dr. Weinstein-Evron. One of the first stops was Austria, home to a virtual paleontology lab run by Gerhard W. Weber, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Vienna. There scientists were able to assess whether the bone belonged to a modern human or a Neanderthal, which are thought also to have occupied the region during that time period. Using high resolution micro-CT scanning, Dr. Weber created a 3D replica of the upper left maxilla that allowed him to investigate its surface features and, virtually, to remove enamel from the teeth. He then performed a morphological and metric test that compared the Misliya fossil with about 30 other specimens, including fossils of Neanderthals, Homo erectus, more recent Homo sapiens, and other hominins that lived in the Middle Pleistocene in Asia, Africa Europe and North America. \u201cThe shape of the second molar, the two premolars and the whole maxilla are very modern,\u201d said Dr. Weber.  More Reporting on Human Origins  The tests also found that the base of the cheek bone was located above the first molar, the incisors lacked a shovel shape, and the premolars were high and narrow, all characteristics found in modern humans and not Neanderthals. \u201cIt\u2019s not a little bit modern, or on the border of being modern,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really modern human.\u201d \u201cIt looks like they\u2019ve done a really thorough study of the morphology of the maxilla and determined it\u2019s not a Neanderthal,\u201d said Melanie L. Chang, an anthropologist from Portland State University who was not involved in the study. \u201cI believe them.\u201d Next, the archaeologists determined the jawbone\u2019s age by performing three dating techniques in Australia, France and Israel. \u201cThe dating had to be rock solid,\u201d said Rolf M. Quam, an anthropologist at Binghamton University in New York and an author of the paper. The team dated the tooth dentin and enamel, the sediment stuck to the upper jaw, and tools found near the fossil. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much more we could do with this little bone,\u201d said Dr. Quam. \u201cI think we\u2019ve squeezed blood from a turnip here.\u201d Together, the techniques put the jawbone at between 177,000 and 194,000 years old, in line with what was already known about the period during which the cave was inhabited. \u201cThis thing is as old as we thought it was, and it was probably the earliest Homo sapien out of Africa ever found,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Quam. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often you can make a superlative statement, but in this case we can.\u201d The Misliya finding is just the latest in a series of discoveries that are changing the story of our evolutionary past. One study, not yet confirmed, suggested that modern humans may have interbred with Neanderthals in Eurasia about as far back as 220,000 years ago. If so, that would mean that at least some modern humans migrated from Africa far earlier than previously thought. Indeed, early humans may have made multiple journeys through the Levant corridor. \u201cWe are now realizing that it was not one big exodus out of Africa in a given time period,\u201d said Dr. Hershkovitz. \u201cRather, there was a flow of hominins coming in and out of Africa for at least the last half a million years.\u201d"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Unless otherwise noted, the facts in this piece reflect research from those works. The views expressed here are solely those of the author.  (CNN) Reporters and radio and television hosts. Film producers. A US senator and other members of Congress. Candidates for office and leaders of startups. By now, you'd have to be living under a rock not to see the impact the accusations of workplace harassment and assault are having on industry, culture and politics. Time Magazine has named the \"Silence Breakers\" its person of the year. Politicians have resigned from office or are choosing not to run again. Americans everywhere are driving themselves crazy asking: What do we do next? How can we fix this problem? Do we need new hiring practices, better HR procedures?", "Robert Sutton   There's actually a simpler way to screen for many sexual harassers: Use interviews, background checks, trial periods and other employee selection methods. And just don't hire the jerks.  Here's what I mean. About 10 years ago, I was talking with a Silicon Valley executive about my research on workplace jerks (I call them a**holes). By 2007, hundreds of careful studies had showed that \"certified a**holes\" (people who routinely leave others feeling demeaned, de-energized, and disrespected) undermine their colleagues' health and productivity. In 2006, for example, The Ohio State University's Bennett Tepper and his colleagues estimated the damage that abusive supervisors inflict on employees cost US companies $23.8 billion a year.  The executive responded that estimating the \"TCA\" (total cost of a**holes) was more than an intellectual exercise in his company.  Read More He told me about his company's star salesperson, who was also a flaming jerk. Let's call him \"Ethan.\" Ethan routinely screamed at and belittled peers, underlings and bosses. His angry late-night email rants were legendary. Many colleagues refused to work with him, and his assistants rarely lasted longer than a year. Finally, after Ethan hollered at and insulted an HR employee about a small increase in health care costs that was beyond her control, company executives had enough of his antics. They instructed HR staffers to calculate Ethan's personal \"TCA\" for the prior year.", "Their calculations indicated that the costs of Ethan's bad behavior included extra time spent by managers, executives and HR staffers dealing with him and his victims; hiring employment lawyers to clean up Ethan's messes; paying damages to Ethan's victims (including a former assistant); hiring and recruiting Ethan's new assistant; and Ethan's anger management training. The HR staffers estimated the cost of this one jerk to the company for one year was $160,000.  Of course, Ethan flew into a rage and threatened to quit when senior executives informed him that, because of these costs, his bonus would be cut about 60%. Ethan ended up staying, in part, because he was a known jerk and so competitors weren't interested in hiring him. Ethan's behavior improved for several months, but he soon reverted back to his nasty ways.  When it comes to hiring and protecting yourself and others from workplace jerks, remember Leonardo da Vinci's advice that, \"It is easier to resist at the beginning than the end.\" Do your homework before offering that star a job; someone else's problem soon become yours. And if you make a mistake and hire demeaning, selfish and disrespectful jerks, call them out on their behavior early and often. If that doesn't work, send them packing. The evidence about damage done by certified jerks like Ethan was strong when I heard his story back in 2006. And it is even stronger now. Ethan's sins are mild compared to the alleged sexual assault and harassment that accusers say was committed by stars, such as Bill O'Reilly, Matt Lauer, and Harvey Weinstein. Lauer apologized but said \"some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized,\" while O'Reilly and Weinstein have both denied the allegations.  These high-profile cases have caused companies to reconsider the risks of looking the other way when stars are allegedly sexual predators or serial sexist pigs -- and to avoid hiring stars who are known creeps. Although their alleged crimes are less despicable and perhaps even more socially acceptable, similar lessons apply to dealing with and hiring garden-variety jerks -- who demean and insult others, spread vicious lies about colleagues, or treat them as if they are worthless and invisible.", "There has been an explosion in recent years of academic research on workplace bullying and incivility. For example, a search of Google Scholar reveals more than 7,000 academic articles that have been published on abusive supervision since 2007. The careful studies that underpin Christine Porath's 2017 book Mastering Civility and my \"Asshole Survival Guide\" show that bullying and rudeness harm employees' mental and physical health (including increased risk of heart attacks and death); damage relationships with friends and family; cause the best employees to quit; undermine employee effort, productivity and creativity; and erode empathy for and service to clients and customers.  If you are thinking about hiring a jerk even in the face of all this information, consider that studies also show rudeness spreads from one person to another like the common cold. And other evidence suggests that jerks are attracted to, or at least more accepting, of jerks like them. The abuse by senior leaders appears to \"roll down\" the hierarchy, so they hire (or infect) supervisors who, in turn, abuse their underlings. So hiring that jerk increases the risk that you will be knee-deep in mean-spirited colleagues, and that you will become a jerk, too.  I acknowledge that some stars are so creative, bring in so much money, attract so much attention, or win so much that it is difficult to resist recruiting, tolerating, indulging and celebrating them. But beware of the price you and others may pay for being exposed to and enabling these bullies to succeed.  Join us on Twitter and Facebook Certified a**holes not only put your health, most precious relationships, and performance at risk. When they are outed and ousted, the guilt by association may mean that the stain spreads to you and ruins your career, too.  And even if you get away with it, if you benefit from hiring, hanging out with, or protecting someone who is a winner and a jerk (or if you are one yourself), you are still a loser as a human being in my book. After all, your success is tainted by the damage that the certified a**hole inflicts on others day after day.

Before automation, we pin boys reset the pins after the bowling balls knocked them down. It was about 11 p.m. All of a sudden, a police car pulled along side us, then in front of us, blocking the walk. We stopped in our tracks and watched wide eyed while the two cops got out of their car, nightsticks in hand and approached us. \"Where you boys going? Where you coming from?

Photograph: David Gray/Reuters", "Climate change is making drought conditions in south-west and south-east Australia worse, with serious ramifications for people\u2019s health and the agriculture industry, a new paper has warned. The Climate Council report states that since the mid-1990s, south-east Australia has experienced a 15% drop in rainfall during late autumn and early winter, with a 25% slump in average rainfall in April and May. A drought that has gripped western Queensland and northern New South Wales since 2012 has put pressure on farmers and forced wildlife into starvation. Projected decreases in average rainfall in winter and spring mean it will \u201clikely be increasingly difficult to erase such rainfall deficits in the future\u201d according to the Climate Council report, which cites data from the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology. Average annual stream flow into Perth\u2019s dams has fallen by 80% since the 1970s, according to the paper, while Sydney dams such as Warragamba and Shoalhaven could experience a 25% drop in water inflows by 2070 if greenhouse gases are not curbed. Melbourne\u2019s four main reservoirs could suffer an 18% decrease in annual stream flows by 2050.  The Climate Council said that increasingly severe droughts were linked to a drop in agricultural productivity and a 15% increase in suicide risk for rural males aged between 30 and 49. The report\u2019s author, Professor Will Steffen, said a much clearer picture of climate change\u2019s influence on drought was emerging through recent research. \u201cThere is stronger evidence that the front that brings rain in from the Southern Ocean has shifted south by about a degree in latitude, while the subtropical ridge, which is a belt of high pressure in central Australia, has intensified,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe are seeing this kind of thing consistently around the planet. This is being driven very strongly by climate change, through the models and supported by observations.\u201d Steffen said future rainfall decreases of even 10% would have \u201cpretty serious\u201d implications for urban water supplies due to the reduced flow of water into catchments. \u201cDroughts have obviously been an important issue for Australia for a long time, but the question is \u2018how far can we adapt?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at wheat yields, for example, yes, you can adapt, but there are limits to that. It\u2019s a bit of false hope that you can adapt infinitely,\u201d he said.

Instead we are trying to continue business as usual,' say James Hansen. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA", "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday 21 December 2009 The climate scientist James Hansen, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, first testified to a US congressional committee about global warming in 1988, not 1989. The scientist who convinced the world to take notice of the looming danger of global warming says it would be better for the planet and for future generations if next week's Copenhagen climate change summit ended in collapse. In an interview with the Guardian, James Hansen, the world's pre-eminent climate scientist, said any agreement likely to emerge from the negotiations would be so deeply flawed that it would be better to start again from scratch. \"I would rather it not happen if people accept that as being the right track because it's a disaster track,\" said Hansen, who heads the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. \"The whole approach is so fundamentally wrong that it is better to reassess the situation. If it is going to be the Kyoto-type thing then [people] will spend years trying to determine exactly what that means.\" He was speaking as progress towards a deal in Copenhagen received a boost today, with India revealing a target to curb its carbon emissions. All four of the major emitters \u2013 the US, China, EU and India \u2013 have now tabled offers on emissions, although the equally vexed issue of funding for developing nations to deal with global warming remains deadlocked. Hansen, in repeated appearances before Congress beginning in 1989, has done more than any other scientist to educate politicians about the causes of global warming and to prod them into action to avoid its most catastrophic consequences. But he is vehemently opposed to the carbon market schemes \u2013 in which permits to pollute are bought and sold \u2013 which are seen by the EU and other governments as the most efficient way to cut emissions and move to a new clean energy economy. Hansen is also fiercely critical of Barack Obama \u2013 and even Al Gore, who won a Nobel peace prize for his efforts to get the world to act on climate change \u2013 saying politicians have failed to meet what he regards as the moral challenge of our age. In Hansen's view, dealing with climate change allows no room for the compromises that rule the world of elected politics. \"This is analagous to the issue of slavery faced by Abraham Lincoln or the issue of Nazism faced by Winston Churchill,\" he said. \"On those kind of issues you cannot compromise. You can't say let's reduce slavery, let's find a compromise and reduce it 50% or reduce it 40%.\" He added: \"We don't have a leader who is able to grasp it and say what is really needed. Instead we are trying to continue business as usual.\" The understated Iowan's journey from climate scientist to activist accelerated in the last years of the Bush administration. Hansen, a reluctant public speaker, says he was forced into the public realm by the increasingly clear looming spectre of droughts, floods, famines and drowned cities indicated by the science. That enormous body of scientific evidence has been put under a microscope by climate sceptics after last month's release online of hacked emails sent by respected researchers at the climate research unit of the University of East Anglia. Hansen admitted the controversy could shake public's trust, and called for an investigation. \"All that stuff they are arguing about the data doesn't really change the analysis at all, but it does leave a very bad impression,\" he said. The row reached Congress today, with Republicans accusing the researchers of engaging in \"scientific fascism\" and pressing the Obama administration's top science adviser, John Holdren, to condemn the email. Holdren, a climate scientist who wrote one of the emails in the UEA trove, said he was prepared to denounce any misuse of data by the scientists \u2013 if one is proved. Hansen has emerged as a leading campaigner against the coal industry, which produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other fuel source. He has become a fixture at campus demonstrations and last summer was arrested at a protest against mountaintop mining in West Virginia, where he called the Obama government's policies \"half-assed\". He has irked some environmentalists by espousing a direct carbon tax on fuel use. Some see that as a distraction from rallying support in Congress for cap-and-trade legislation that is on the table. He is scathing of that approach. \"This is analagous to the indulgences that the Catholic church sold in the middle ages. The bishops collected lots of money and the sinners got redemption. Both parties liked that arrangement despite its absurdity. That is exactly what's happening,\" he said. \"We've got the developed countries who want to continue more or less business as usual and then these developing countries who want money and that is what they can get through offsets [sold through the carbon markets].\" For all Hansen's pessimism, he insists there is still hope. \"It may be that we have already committed to a future sea level rise of a metre or even more but that doesn't mean that you give up. \"Because if you give up you could be talking about tens of metres. So I find it screwy that people say you passed a tipping point so it's too late. In that case what are you thinking: that we are going to abandon the planet?

But with more than $6 trillion under management, it is the largest. And that makes its CEO, Larry Fink, a bit like the EF Hutton of the old commercials. When Larry Fink talks, people listen. Lately, Fink has been doing some serious talking. He sent a letter to more than 1,000 corporate CEOs worldwide telling them to get involved in socially responsible causes or risk falling out of favor with his investors. Fink didn\u2019t exactly spell out what he had in mind when he said companies have a responsibility to make \"a positive contribution to society,\" and not to just \"deliver financial performance.\" But he did note that wealth concentration is at historically high levels, and that too few workers are setting aside money for retirement. Overall, we think that Fink is on to something. Governments, which traditionally have taken the lead on these kinds of issues, have largely punted. In some cases, they have been downright complicit in these disturbing trends. What's more, corporate responsibility programs can be good for companies in improving their brand, increasing employee engagement, and even helping them innovate. The consumer products company Unilever, for instance, developed more cost-effective ways of making hair conditioner through a campaign to use less water. Even so, Fink\u2019s words are impossibly vague. CEOs could dismiss them simply by saying they don\u2019t know what he means. They might also argue \u2014 not without reason \u2014 that wealth creation itself is a social cause. It creates the middle classes that enable democratic government. It also provides the tax bases that those governments use to fund education, health care, scientific research and more. To get the attention of corporate leaders, many of them gathered at this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, we suggest that Fink list some specific actions. One would have to be to end the confiscatory pay packages that top executives have carved out for themselves at the expense of shareholders. Income inequality and the decline in retirement resources have been driven by technology and globalization, but also by surging top-end pay at publicly held companies. Even adjusted for inflation, the average CEO pay package has risen more than 900% since the 1970s.  Another approach might be to accept the argument that wealth creation is a social cause \u2014 and then take it to its logical conclusion. All companies are not equal. Some make a lot more money than others. Some pay their workers a lot more. Some make money by imposing higher health care and environmental costs on societies. Fink could convey to CEOs that if they want taxes on their profits to remain low in an era of mounting budget deficits, they should act pre-emptively to reduce the burdens they impose and make themselves less of a target. In the final analysis, Fink is right for one simple reason. Corporations have long claimed to be the equivalent of persons, a move that gives them rights of political speech and due process, among other things. They can hardly be people when it suits them and soulless profit machines the rest of the time. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

The five articles include accusing the president of obstruction of justice. (Nov. 15) AP Several of President Trump\u2019s actions since taking office meet this high standard. They were not simply inappropriate or wrong; they threaten to undermine our fundamental constitutional structure, our national security and our democracy. In light of this, we have introduced five articles of impeachment against Trump and called for immediate impeachment hearings. The articles address a range of Trump\u2019s actions, from obstruction of justice and violations of the Constitution\u2019s foreign and domestic emoluments clauses to undermining the independence of the federal judiciary and the freedom of the press.  We recognize that several investigations are ongoing, including one led by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. We support a continuation of these efforts to ensure complete transparency and accountability. Sufficient facts, however, already exist in the public record to warrant the start of impeachment proceedings in Congress. Given the magnitude of the constitutional crisis engendered by Trump\u2019s actions, we see no reason for delay. For example, with regard to obstruction of justice, we already know that Trump fired former FBI director James Comey while the bureau was investigating potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, and the president has already admitted on national television that he had the Russia investigation on his mind when he fired Comey. We also already know that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian attorney who offered to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to help his father\u2019s campaign. These facts are uncontested. Similarly, uncontroverted facts support the charge that the president has violated the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses. Unlike all of his modern predecessors, Trump has refused to release his tax returns or to divest his assets or place them into a blind trust. As a result, foreign governments and even the United States government, have spent thousands of dollars at Trump-branded properties in which Trump continues to have an ownership interest. The framers of our Constitution wisely prohibited presidents from accepting these kinds of payments to protect against their potentially corrupting influence.  POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Consider that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reportedly paid $270,000 to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., as part a lobbying effort, and the Embassy of Kuwait held an event there estimated at somewhere between $40,000 and $60,000. Domestically, Trump\u2019s repeated visits to Trump-branded properties in which he retains an ownership interest have caused the federal government to spend money at his businesses, including at least $137,000 by the Secret Service for golf carts and more than $1,000 for just two nights of lodging at Mar-a-Lago by the National Security Council. There is also already a well-established record of Trump actions that undermine the independence of the federal judiciary and the freedom of the press. For example, his pardon of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio for criminal contempt of court is a matter of public record, as is his tweet criticizing a \u201cso-called judge\u201d who had overturned his executive order banning refugees from certain Muslim-majority nations. And it is also public record that the president circulated a video of himself violently wrestling a man covered by a CNN logo. Many more facts support the president's impeachment. To be clear, we are highly sensitive to the fact that impeachment may result in overturning the results of a democratic election. Yet the Constitution\u2019s framers provided for this extraordinary remedy to allow the people\u2019s representatives to confront extraordinary threats to our democracy and constitutional order posed by the actions of federal officeholders, including the president. When Benjamin Franklin was asked at the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention what kind of government the framers had established, he responded, \u201cA Republic, if you can keep it.\u201d It is time for the House to rise to the challenge and begin an impeachment inquiry.

The graph had been scanned from the New York Times\u2019 Innovation report and it shows how much the traffic to NYTimes.com declined between 2011 and 2013 \u2014 nearly by half, from a high of 160 million visitors to 60 million visitors.", "From the New York Times Innovation Report, via Buzzfeed. It's a similar story with other landing pages, particularly in the journalism sphere, and the collective internet hive mind most often blames social media for the decline, though there are plenty of suspects. Facebook may be the cause, or it\u2019s possibly Google, or maybe it\u2019s your mobile phone\u2019s home screen. Or, as journalism professor Jeff Jarvis has long contended, the article page is now the new homepage. Whatever the new homepage is, and despite the warnings in that grainy graph, we still want one. When we launched Vox, we built it on the same code base as SB Nation, the sports site in our Vox Media family. We did this to save time and get our site up and running in just nine weeks. To develop and design a different homepage that works across multiple platforms, and with all sorts of content would have taken much, much longer. If you go check out SB Nation, you\u2019ll see similarities in structure to Vox\u2019s current homepage, though we invested time in a whole new look and feel (and our designers pulled it off; letting the two sites feel wholly independent despite the shared backbone). It's a good design, but we can ride on our sporting compatriots' coattails for only so long. It\u2019s time to start on our own homepage. We\u2019ve got some good ideas cooking, but I asked to hear yours. I\u2019ll prattle on a bit more about some of what I\u2019m thinking about our homepage, but you can skip my thoughts and jump down to the comments to see what other readers recommended. As a reward for sticking around, here's some more homepage thoughts. This project is not so much about making some beautiful design that pulls in readers (though that\u2019s always nice). But I already think we have that. I love the impact of our single story view when there's major breaking news, as seen in the photo above when the scandal at the VA was unfolding. But we have a problem with the lack of organization on the site. Readers come to Vox and have plenty of places to go, but not a lot of guidance on where and how to get there. That\u2019s on purpose. I made a decision during our fast launch to not add many organizational cues to our site. There would be no navigation bar, like you see on many news sites; there are no set sections; and there are very few \"breadcrumbs,\" which is digital-speak for clickable items that lead readers to similar content on websites. I did this for two reasons. One, to save time. The mere hint of organizing principles can send media folk into long, philosophical debates about word choice and metadata necessities. These conversations spiral into meetings that end in the same place they started, only everyone is a little more frustrated. I thought it would be better to save those conversations until after we had the site up and running. The second reason was this: we did not want to impose order on theories alone. We had ideas about the topics we\u2019d be covering. We hired one of the best higher education reporters in the country. We found a rising star on the immigration beat. But this entire endeavor was new to all of us. What if, when we started publishing, it turned out our immigration reporter shone at Shakespeare analysis and our education reporter asked to switch to the birthday beat? We agreed to wait to see what we would be organizing before we set about organizing it. Two months in, we have some answers. Now we just need to figure out how to go about doing it. Since the homepage is really for you the reader, I opened the comments for a few hours to hear what you think. I wanted to know why folks go to a homepage? To scan the news? To see the newest things that have been published? Or something else entirely? Readers offered up a bunch of great suggestions and thoughts. If I shut the comments down before you could make one, but you want to add your thoughts to the homepage discussion, feel free to email me at editors@vox.com. Thanks!

Hochberg served as chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States from 2009-2017 and is a fall 2017 Pritzker fellow at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.   (CNN) A new White House is tasked with filling 4,000 political jobs at over 400 federal departments and agencies, according to the Center for Presidential Transition. Perhaps it's inevitable that every presidential administration fills a few empty seats with cronies, hacks and ideologues who are unqualified for their jobs. But something very different -- and troubling -- is happening in the Trump administration.  Although the post is being hotly contested, it appears current White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney will become interim head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, becoming just the latest Trump nominee tapped to lead an agency he had previously been intent on destroying or eliminating. Mulvaney once called the CFPB a \"sad, sick, joke.\"", "Fred P. Hochberg  This isn't normal. This isn't a new administration deciding it would like agencies to have different policy or regulatory enforcement priorities from the previous one. This is an administration trying to neuter agencies that were created and funded by acts of Congress. And this won't stop until Congress, particularly the Senate, does something about it. There has been no shortage of reporting about how the President is (or is not) staffing his administration, but it is often suggestive of mere managerial incompetence. For example, we have learned that the Trump administration is well behind the pace of the Bush and Obama administrations in both nominations and confirmations.  Our government somehow has no ambassador to South Korea or permanent assistant secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs at the State Department amid one of the worst crises on the Korean Peninsula since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Read More This is concerning, to say the least. But this still doesn't capture the significance of what the Trump administration is up to.", "Earlier this month, I watched Scott Garrett's confirmation hearing to lead the Export-Import Bank of the United States, or EXIM, the agency I ran from 2009-2017. When I led the bank, Garrett was a New Jersey congressman who sat on the House committee with oversight over us. Garrett didn't just question our work, as any member of Congress properly should, he clearly did not think EXIM should exist. And he said so on many occasions. He had decided, against all evidence, that EXIM, which provides critical export finance for domestic small businesses and foreign buyers of Americans goods and services, \"embodies the corruption of the free enterprise system,\" as Politico reported Garrett said in 2015.  Garrett is entitled to think whatever he wants. But to put him in charge of EXIM is, as Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown recently said, like \"putting an arsonist in charge of the fire department.\" If confirmed, Garrett would join the growing list of Trump appointees, including Scott Pruitt at EPA and Rick Perry at Energy, who have expressly opposed the mission of the agency they are leading. An agency leader sufficiently determined to gut their own agencies \u2014 as Pruitt is and Mulvaney and Garrett certainly would be \u2014 has countless ways to do it. They can leave senior positions unfilled. They can ignore the work and recommendations of career scientists and technical experts. They can slow-walk grants, funding or financing requests. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called this strategy \"deconstructing the administrative state.\" This White House is free to try Bannon's strategy, but not unilaterally and not without authorization from Congress.  And yet that is exactly what it is doing. In an extraordinary move, the Trump Justice Department this summer concluded the Constitution doesn't empower individual members of Congress to conduct oversight of federal agencies.", "This is the Trump administration essentially telling political appointees they can ignore any request from members of Congress who want to investigate how executive branch agencies are doing their job. I know several members of Congress who may not like the EPA or EXIM but like even less a White House that doesn't respect Congress as a coequal branch of government, and this one clearly doesn't. Here is Congress' chance to take a stand. Congress has limited power to stop an interim Cabinet appointment for someone like Mulvaney, but the Senate can reject Garrett's nomination as chairman of the EXIM Bank. And it should. There are still hundreds of unfilled political appointee jobs requiring Senate confirmation, and the Senate should also deny any appointee who does not understand or respect a basic fact: Congress passes laws, creates and funds agencies, and agencies implement the will of Congress. Future political appointees should also be asked explicitly if they would respect and respond to information and oversight requests from members of Congress. If they refuse, they should not be confirmed either. There may come a point when Congress needs to go even further. In 1982, the House voted to hold President Reagan's Environmental Protection Agency administrator in contempt of Congress for her refusal to turn over subpoenaed documents to a House committee. It was the first time a Cabinet-level official had ever faced such a charge. This Congress shouldn't hesitate to take a similar step if Trump political appointees continue to willfully disregard its oversight authority. Join us on Twitter and Facebook For years, under both Democratic and Republican presidencies, members of Congress have been concerned by the growing power of the executive branch. And of course, a trio of Republican senators \u2014 Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and John McCain \u2014 have recently and forcefully rebuked the Trump administration for overstepping its bounds.  We have heard some stirring words about the expansion of executive power, but now it's time to translate them into specific action that will restore the rightful place of Congress as a coequal branch of government."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

If ISIS can't find victories in Iraq and Syria that rally violent, young recruits, then its recruiters will seek them elsewhere. The sequential progression of attacks over the past week showcased ISIS' reach -- a Potemkin village approach that makes the group appear larger and more powerful than the reality of its retreat in Syria and Iraq.  With foreign fighter flows to the group declining by an estimated 75 percent, manpower is down and terrorist operations -- rather than more conventional and insurgent approaches -- conserve ISIS' dwindling forces. Each suicide bomber, often a recruit with no viable option to return home, achieves a far greater impact hitting soft targets than participating in traditional assaults, which are increasingly crushed by coalition forces. The martyrdom option provides a new direction and motivation for violence-addicted foreign fighters who'd prefer to go out as a hero rather than just another casualty on the front lines. ISIS will use every last devotee to inflict as many casualties as possible. Beyond signaling strength when it's down, ISIS may be preparing for a future after Syria and Iraq. ISIS continues to retreat, moving back ever closer to Raqqa and Mosul. As the coalition's noose tightens, ISIS is losing tax revenues and its illicit oil operations are suffering. It can leverage affiliates -- as it did this past week in Yemen, Bangladesh and possibly Malaysia -- and strike symbolic targets in Saudi Arabia, which may mobilize sympathetic populations willing to take on the group's banner. This support base will be an essential mechanism for the Islamic State to transition from a predatory, self-financing operation to a donation-generating global terrorist organization similar to al Qaeda 10 years ago. Fleeing fighters and ISIS stalwarts will need new homes. Affiliates and emerging sympathetic populations must be identified should the group's members seek to escape.  ISIS' Ramadan terrorist offensive shows how the group will play on any local grievance and motivation for terrorism to expand its influence. Targets in Saudi Arabia were sectarian (a Shiite mosque in Qatif), anti-Western (the U.S. Consulate in Jeddah) and anti-regime (the prophet's Mosque in Medina). A bombing outside the prophet's mosque mirrors a legendary seizure of the Grand Mosque in 1979 and continues the Salafi-jihadi tradition of declaring the Saudi regime apostate and a puppet of the West. In Bangladesh and Lebanon, meanwhile, the group claimed credit for attacks focused on specific communities -- Western and Christian respectively. ISIS will play to any audience and co-opt any animosities to expand its brand.", "Lebanese Christians in the village of al-Qaa mourn over the coffin of a relative who was killed in a suicide attack on June 27. (JOSEPH EID/AFP/Getty Images) ISIS propaganda after the Ramadan violence will be informative for what the world will see next. The group's slow decline will likely lead it to exploit the successes of its affiliates, similar to what was seen of al Qaeda when it was holed up in Pakistan. Those places and populations promoted in propaganda and issues of Dabiq -- an online ISIS magazine -- will point to where the group believes it's gotten the greatest resonance from its latest international terror campaign. The promotion of Bangladesh and Southeast Asia in recent communiqu\u00e9s may be a first sign of where it sees ripe recruitment grounds.  The world should also brace for continuing waves of suicide attacks and hostage-taking assaults. Since the success of Paris last November, ISIS affiliates or inspired supporters have copied these tactics. With so many foreign fighters unable to return home, ISIS will use every last devotee to inflict as many casualties as possible. Its dying breath won't come with the fall of Raqqa -- more likely it will be from the explosive, fiery demise of its suicide bombing cadres.

Jackman likes Dukale's coffee so much, he markets it. Laughing Man Coffee has partnered with Keurig to launch Dukale's Blend. Dukale has a relatively small farm for the coffee world, with just 800 trees. He works 10 to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, to barely make ends meet and care for his family. After Jackman, a self-proclaimed coffee snob, got a taste of Dukale's coffee and learned his farming methods had a zero carbon footprint, he pledged to help him and his community.  Jackman returned home to New York, where he made a passionate plea to world leaders at the United Nations Climate Week to support farmers like Dukale.

If you're not confident the drinking water in your home is lead free, consider buying a water filter or other treatment device. Before you purchase a water-treatment device, experts recommend getting a water-quality report from your utility, then having a certified lab test your home\u2019s water. Question: How can I reduce the risk of lead in my drinking water? Answer: Even if you don\u2019t have lead pipes, it\u2019s possible for lead to get in your water after leaching from faucets or solder on pipes.", "One way to reduce the risk: If water has been sitting in your pipes for more than six hours, turn on your tap and run water through it until it comes out cold, at least 1 or 2 minutes. That helps flush any lead accumulated because of low water flow. If you decide to buy a filter, be aware that each water filter guards against specific contaminants. Make sure you get a filter that reduces or eliminates the risk of lead. Q: What type of water-treatment device do I want? A: Several types of systems filter water used in homes. The filter may be attached to a faucet, sit on a counter or be affixed beneath the sink. Filters also are found in refrigerators that serve water through the door, water pitchers and some water bottles. Choose the type of filter based on your needs. For example, do you simply want to filter water in your kitchen, or do you want a filtration system for an entire home? Reverse-osmosis devices screen out contaminants but can be more difficult to install than some filters. Distillers use electricity to boil water from a tap, reduce contaminants and collect clean water in a jug.", "Q: Where can I find detailed information about each type of filter or system to help me make my decision? A: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency offers an explanation of filtration-system options, including varieties that reduce lead. Consumer Reports has an overview of filter types. The publication also offers a more detailed report that rates and recommends filters. It's available only to subscribers, who can view the publication\u2019s overall score for filters after evaluating factors such as how well a filter removes lead, chloroform and bad taste. Using these kinds of consumer-oriented sites will help you research to determine what kind of filter best fits your need. Once you\u2019ve decided the type of filter you want, you can research brands online or go to building-supply stores and examine different brands and prices. Q: How do I gauge quality in a water filter? A: Government agencies, such as the EPA, don\u2019t test water filters for effectiveness in removing lead from water. You can check whether a particular brand of filter has been certified by NSF International, a private organization founded as the National Sanitation Foundation in 1944 that tests and certifies water filters, or the Water Quality Association, a trade group representing the water-treatment industry. The American National Standards Institute, a non-profit organization that oversees development of voluntary consensus standards, has accredited both organizations.", "NSF International tests and verifies five areas when it certifies a water-treatment system. A product must prove it reduces contaminants, does not add harmful substances to water, is structurally sound, and uses consistent production and manufacturing standards. A system is checked for misleading claims, labeling or advertising. To be certified under NSF standards, a filter or water treatment system must demonstrate it is able to reduce lead from 15 parts per billion 10 ppb or less. Keep in mind that some products will claim to be tested to NSF standards but do not have the organization\u2019s certification. NSF International hasn't vetted such products. Q: Where can consumers find out which brands and models of filters are professionally certified? A: NSF International\u2019s online database is searchable so you can find certified models of various filter types. The EPA suggests using NSF-certified products to ensure your filter meets standards. Search the NSF database by type of filter, brand and the substance you want to filter out at http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU. Another option: the Water Quality Association\u2019s database at https://www.wqa.org. The water-treatment industry trade organization tests and certifies filtration systems for use in homes or business properties. The EPA cites it as a credible resource. Q: How much do water filters cost? A: Retail websites quote a range of prices. Costco lists prices that range from $75 for a 450-gallon, under-counter filtration system, to $1,200 for a whole-home system. You can compare prices by visiting multiple retailers, but prices are often similar. An Aquasana AQ 5200.55 two-stage, under-counter water filter was listed for $99.99 on Amazon.com. Home Depot carried the same water filter at an identical price. A WaterChef U9000, a 1,000-gallon filter was listed at $349.95 on Amazon. The manufacturer listed the same price on its website. Prices will vary depending on the type, size and features of a water-filtration system, but the unit's cost is not the only consideration. Replacement filters can range from less than $20 to $400 each year, according to Consumer Reports. Q: How do I maintain a filtration system? A: A big mistake people make is not replacing the filter when the manufacturer recommends it, an NSF spokeswoman said. Some systems have an indicator light or another alert that signals when a filter should be changed.", "The filters become less effective as contaminants clog a filter\u2019s pores or adhere to a filter\u2019s surface. You may not notice when a filter becomes less effective, so it\u2019s important to follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. Replacement typically is recommended based on a set period or a certain number of gallons that a filter processes. \u201cAny system that's used to treat water needs to be maintained,\" said Kevin Chadwick, a water manager with Maricopa County Environmental Services Department in Phoenix. Q: Is getting a filter system less expensive than purchasing bottled water? A: You probably can find a filtration system that is less expensive than bottled water. But filtration-system costs can add up depending on the quality, filters and maintenance. Filter systems also are convenient. You can use filtered water to drink and cook and have the convenience of not having to drive to a store to buy water. Sometimes, bottled water is a necessity. In Flint, Mich., communities used bottled water after tests revealed lead levels that exceeded what could be removed with in-home filters.", "\u201cBottled water is a solution at times,\u201d said David Loveday, the Water Quality Association\u2019s government affairs director. \u201cSome areas, they were testing and getting readings of about 150 parts per billion. That\u2019s where bottled water comes into play.\u201d Q: If I have a complaint about a filtration system, to whom do I take it?  A: Submit it to the manufacturer or to the Federal Trade Commission at FTC.gov. The FTC website has a portal to submit product complaints.

But a team of British academics will next month formally announce the first step towards creating an artificial volcano by going ahead with the world's first major \"geo-engineering\" field-test in the next few months. The ultimate aim is to mimic the cooling effect that volcanoes have when they inject particles into the stratosphere that bounce some of the Sun's energy back into space, so preventing it from warming the Earth and mitigating the effects of man-made climate change. Before the full-sized system can be deployed, the research team will test a scaled-down version of the balloon-and-hose design. Backed by a \u00a31.6m government grant, the team will send a balloon to a height of 1km over an undisclosed location. It will pump nothing more than water into the air, but it will allow climate scientists and engineers to gauge the engineering feasibility of the plan. Ultimately, they aim to test the impact of sulphates and other aerosol particles if they are sprayed directly into the stratosphere. If the technical problems posed by controlling a massive balloon at more than twice the cruising height of a commercial airliner are resolved, then the team from Cambridge, Oxford, Reading and Bristol universities expect to move to full-scale solar radiation tests. The principal investigator, Matthew Watson, a former UK government scientific adviser on emergencies and now a Bristol University lecturer, says the experiment is inspired by volcanoes and the way they can affect the climate after eruptions. \"We will test pure water only, in sufficient quantity to test the engineering. Much more research is required,\" he said, in answer the question of what effect a planetary-scale deployment of the technology could have. Other leaders of the government-funded Stratospheric particle injection for climate engineering (Spice) project have investigated using missiles, planes, tall chimneys and other ways to send thousands of tonnes of particles into the air but have concluded that a simple balloon and hosepipe system is the cheapest. The research is paid for by the government-funded Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. \"The whole weight of this thing is going to be a few hundred tonnes. That's the weight of several double-decker buses. So imagine how big a helium balloon do you need to hold several double-decker buses \u2013 a big balloon. We're looking at a balloon which is possibly 100-200m in diameter. It's about the same size as Wembley stadium,\" said the Oxford engineering lecturer Hugh Hunt in an interview earlier this year. \"This hose would be just like a garden hose, 20km long and we pump stuff up the pipe. The nice thing about it is that we can really have a knob, if you like, which we can control to adjust the rate at which we inject these particles.\" While the October experiment is expected to have no impact on the atmosphere, it could also be used to try out \"low-level cloud whitening\", a geo-engineering proposal backed financially by Microsoft chairman and philanthropist Bill Gates. In this case, fine sea salt crystals would be pumped up and sprayed into the air to increase the number of droplets and the reflectivity in clouds. Together, many droplets are expected to diffuse sunlight and make a cloud whiter. However, environment groups in Britain and the US said the government's experiment was a dangerous precedent for a full-scale deployment that could affect rainfall and food supplies. Even if the approach successfully cools the planet by bouncing some of the Sun's energy back into space, it would do nothing for the build up of CO2 in the atmosphere, which leads to increased ocean acidity. \"What is being floated is not only a hose but the whole idea of geo-engineering the planet. This is a huge waste of time and money and shows the UK government's disregard for UN processes. It is the first step in readying the hardware to inject particles into the stratosphere. It has no other purpose and it should not be allowed to go ahead,\" said Pat Mooney, chair of ETC Group in Canada, an NGO that supports socially responsible development of technology. Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth UK, said: \"We are going to have to look at new technologies which could suck CO2 out of the air. But we don't need to do is invest in harebrained schemes to reflect sunlight into space when we have no idea at all what impact this may have on weather systems around the globe.\" But the principle of large-scale geoengineering has been backed strongly by Sir Martin Rees, the former president of Royal Society, which in 2009 concluded in a report that it may be necessary to have a \"plan B\" if governments could not reduce emissions. \"Nothing should divert us from the main priority of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. But if such reductions achieve too little, too late, there will surely be pressure to consider a 'plan B' \u2013 to seek ways to counteract the climatic effects of greenhouse gas emissions by 'geoengineering',\" said Rees. Members of the British public who were consulted by researchers in advance of the Spice experiment were broadly sceptical. \"Overall almost all of our participants were willing to entertain the notion that the test-bed as an engineering test \u2013 a research opportunity \u2013 should be pursued. Equally, very few were fully comfortable with the notion of stratospheric aerosols as a response to climate change,\" the Cardiff University-based researchers concluded. Hacking the planet - potential geo-engineering solutions Ocean nourishment Billions of iron filings are deposited in the ocean to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom. The aim is to enhance biological productivity to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Many experiments have been conducted, including fertilisation of 900 square kilometers (350 sq miles) of the Atlantic. Results so far are disappointing. Space mirrors  Giant \"mirrors\", made of wire mesh, could be sent into in orbit to deflect sunlight back into space. But the scale needed, the expense and the potential unintended consequences are so great that it is widely considered unrealistic. In the same league as the idea to mine the moon to create a shielding cloud of dust. Cloud whitening The idea is to increase the water content in low clouds by spraying sea water at them. This makes them reflect more sunlight. It would be pretty harmless, and cheap but would have to be done on an immense scale to have any global effect. Backed by Bill Gates. Artificial trees Proposed by climate scientist Wallace Broecker who imagines 60m artificial \"trees\" dotted around the world, \"scrubbing\" the air by capturing CO2 in a filter and then storing it underground. The trees could remove more carbon dioxide than an equivalent-sized real tree. Albedo changes Painting roofs and roads white, covering deserts in reflective plastic sheeting, dropping pale-coloured litter into the ocean and genetically engineering crops to be paler have all been proposed to reflect sunlight back into space. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Carbon dioxide is collected from coal or other fossil fuel power plants and is then pumped underground. Works in principle but it is expensive and increases the fuel needs of a coal-fired plant by 25%-40%. More than 40 plants have been built with many others planned. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 September to remove a reference to the Royal Society  Topics"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

His success was remarkable as he had no scientific training and completed his A-levels only after joining the Board of Trade in his teens in 1961. Paul was born in Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), to an English mother, Maud (nee Godden Griffiths), and a Danish father, Carl, a civil servant. His childhood was turbulent as his parents fought constantly. When they finally separated, Maud returned to Britain with Paul and his younger brother, Michael, settling in Hastings, where the boys went to the local grammar school. While Paul was still studying for his A-levels his struggling mother packed him off with \u00a31 and the name of a contact in a London hostel to start work as a clerical officer at the Board of Trade. He lived in the hostel, working at London Zoo at the weekends to earn more money, and studied alone for his A-levels. However, he managed to rise through the ranks of the civil service. He worked on the Committee of Inquiry into Civil Aviation, which led to the Edwards report of 1969. He then went to the British embassy in Paris, negotiating traffic rights for British airlines. After two years as assistant secretary to the National Enterprise Board, in 1981 he became secretary of the newly formed British Technology Group. His next posting, in 1985, on promotion to assistant secretary in the DTI\u2019s finance division, saw him at his most determined and creative as he pushed the DTI towards the fundamental realignment of the civil service into executive agencies following the Robin Ibbs \u201cNext Steps\u201d report of 1988.

For support, Wilson paired Tafesh with Pat and Bob Keffer.", "Before Ghada Tafesh left the Gaza Strip for college in the United States, her family gave her a necklace with two pendants. One was in the shape of historic Palestine. The other was an olive tree. \u201cThey wanted me to have something that would remind me of home, and to never be ashamed of where I come from,\u201d she told me. Ms. Tafesh has much to be proud of as she begins the final year of her master\u2019s program in humanities at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., this fall. But the trade-off was painful: getting her education meant not returning home for six years. In 2012, she faced one of the toughest decisions a Gazan teenager can make. With the help of a scholarship, she could attend college in the United States. It would afford her significantly more opportunity than she would ever have in her hometown. Gaza\u2019s few universities provide only basic academic offerings, with very limited master\u2019s and doctoral programs. Then there\u2019s the city\u2019s youth unemployment rate: 60 percent, by most estimates. But by opting to go abroad, Ms. Tafesh would be choosing a kind of exile, since returning at all would mean the risk of getting stuck back inside the blockade. \u201cReceiving entrance and exit permits to and from the Strip is a lengthy and unpredictable process,\u201d said Shai Grunberg of Gisha, an Israeli nonprofit that aims to protect freedom of movement of Palestinians. \u201cThere are no guarantees that if a student from Gaza receives an entrance permit to visit family in the Strip, they will manage to secure an exit permit in time to return to their studies.\u201d Steven Keller, who directs scholarship and exchange programs in the West Bank and Gaza, agreed: \u201cWe advise students not to return to Gaza during school holidays, due to the personal risk of getting stuck and losing a scholarship.\u201d Ms. Tafesh had already experienced life in the United States: She\u2019d spent her junior year of high school as an exchange student, living with a host family in Laurel, Md. The sound of airplanes from the nearby international airport often woke her up at night and reminded her of Israeli warplanes that meant school was shutting down \u2014 \u201cyou could feel the walls and floor shaking,\u201d she said, describing being in ninth grade while bombings went off nearby. But the opportunities in the United States amazed her. Until then, she\u2019d been unaware of how limited life in Gaza was. \u201cYou accept your reality, until you see how other people live,\u201d she told me recently. \u201cI love to read poetry and novels,\u201d counting Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf and Geoffrey Chaucer as among her favorites. \u201cBut there was no library at our school\u201d in Gaza. There were no sports teams or science labs, either. \u201cOur science books were full of experiments that we never got to do.\u201d Eager for more, Ms. Tafesh contacted the Hope Fund, a program that secures scholarships from American colleges for talented Palestinian youth predominately from disadvantaged backgrounds. She applied to Wilson College and was accepted with a full scholarship. After she received her United States visa in July 2012, she was worried that she wouldn\u2019t be able to get an Israeli exit permit to leave Gaza. Her worry was understandable. In 2008, the State Department withdrew Fulbright grants awarded to Palestinian students in Gaza after they were denied permission to leave by Israel. According to Gisha, only 295 students traveled from Gaza to academic institutions abroad in 2015. Last year, the Palestinian Civil Affairs Committee received more than 400 applications from students for exit permits for the purpose of higher education, but only 37 applications were approved by Israel. Permit requests must be submitted to Israeli authorities at least three weeks before the travel date, and up to 50 days in advance, along with all supporting documents (like approved visas and acceptance letters). In the first half of 2017, the number of exits by Palestinians dropped by 55 percent, compared with the same period in 2016. But Ms. Tafesh got her permit and became one of the first students from the Middle East to attend Wilson College. Her freshman-year roommate hadn\u2019t heard of Gaza until meeting her. As she began to find a community, Ms. Tafesh made it her mission to educate her peers about her part of the world. She\u2019s given presentations on air pollution from bombings in the Gaza valley and the destruction of natural resources. She taught her roommate some Arabic, and together they would Skype with Ms. Tafesh\u2019s parents overseas, when internet connection in Gaza was available. \u201cI wanted to show my classmates that Palestinians are different then the way they\u2019re represented in Western media,\u201d she said. On Election Day in November 2016, peers who voted against President Trump messaged her to say, \u201cI voted for you today.\u201d When Mr. Trump won, \u201c people messaged me to ask if I was O.K.,\u201d said Ms. Tafesh. \u201cI\u2019m constantly reminded that there are good things about being here, and that there are people who care.\u201d But Ms. Tafesh was often homesick, especially during wars (two have occurred so far in her time abroad) and when, during her sophomore year, she had to undergo open-heart surgery for a congenital heart condition. \u201cBack home in Gaza, I would probably be dead by now,\u201d she said. Operation Protective Edge, Gaza\u2019s longest and bloodiest war, broke out in July 2014, during the summer before her junior year. Beyond the fear of her own family members turning up among the names of the dead, guilt consumed her. In Pennsylvania, she had constant access to both water and electricity. Back home, her family could have one or the other, with four to five hours of access per day. Back in Gaza, Ms. Tafesh wore a hijab and she arrived at college still wearing one. Now, after the rise in hate crimes against Muslim-Americans and a partial travel ban barring visitors from six Muslim-majority countries, she no longer does. \u201cI got too many looks and stares,\u201d she said. \u201dI\u2019ve worn it a couple of times, but I just blend in more and do things a lot easier without it.\u201d Wilson pairs international students with locals who are willing to offer support, and in her graduation pictures, Ms. Tafesh stands between an American couple, Bob and Pat Keffer. \u201cGhada is a very positive person,\u201d said Ms. Keffer. \u201cI know she\u2019s been through a lot in her life, but I never see her down, though she probably is at times. She\u2019s met the rest of my family, she calls my parents grandpa and grandma, and we all love her. I didn\u2019t know too many Muslims, and I\u2019ve learned a lot about the Muslim faith, and that I should be more tolerant.\u201d Though Ms. Tafesh would\u2019ve given anything to stand beside her parents that day, who couldn\u2019t attend her graduation because of the difficulty of getting out of Gaza, the concept of family has taken on a more encompassing meaning for her. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a sense of family and of home here, I would\u2019ve never been able to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cIt keeps me going.\u201d Ms. Tafesh plans to return to Gaza when she finishes her graduate degree this May. By then it will have been almost six years since she\u2019s been home. Once back in Gaza, she wants to teach at a university and expose Gazans to the tenets of a liberal arts education. \u201cYou become a bigger thinker here, and you learn to not be such a passive consumer,\u201d she told me. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m doing this to create a better life back home.\u201d Zaina Arafat (@ZainaArafat) is a Palestinian-American writer. She is currently at work on her first novel."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

If she had to, she tried to do it alone. She couldn't have them worrying about her. Sometimes she'd overhear them losing it in the next room. She didn't have the words to comfort them and feared that anything she'd say would make matters worse. So she sat frozen, wracked with guilt for ignoring their cries. On occasion, though, she allowed herself to turn angry. She was holding it together, why couldn't they? Christine was only 13 when the quiet and exceedingly normal life she and her family enjoyed in Littleton, Colorado, shattered. Read More On April 20, 1999, two heavily armed students went on a shooting rampage at Columbine High School. They murdered 13 people and wounded two dozen others before killing themselves. Among the dead, gunned down in the school library, was Daniel Mauser, Christine's older brother, at the time her only sibling. He was 15.  Nearly two decades have passed. Christine, now 30 and living in Beaverton, Oregon, struggles to remember the sound of Daniel's voice; their shared moments and conversations only come to her in snippets. But the memories surrounding the school shooting that robbed her of her innocence? Those will never go away. Seventh-grade Spanish was letting out when an administrator at her middle school herded Christine and her classmates back into their classroom. It had to do with something that was happening at the nearby high school, though no one would say more. \"We were entering something they called 'lockdown,'\" she says. \"I don't recall any of us having any idea what that meant.\"  The longer they waited, the more questions the students had. Eventually the teacher turned on the television. With the rest of America, Christine and her classmates watched the breaking news with confusion. She saw students being escorted out of the high school. The details from inside were still a mystery.", "Christine Mauser says she and Daniel loved each other despite their differences. \"There could be up to 20 fatalities,\" Christine remembers her mom saying hours later, when she was picked up at school. \"I didn't know if fatalities meant deaths or injuries, and I was too afraid to ask.\"  The house filled with neighbors and family friends. She remembers her father making repeated drives to the high school, desperate to pick up his son. Returning from one of his last trips, he dissolved into screams and tears. A terrified Christine was whisked off to stay the night two doors down.  The neighbors set out to distract her. They ordered pizza and turned on movies. Though it became harder to do so as the hours passed, she tried to convince herself that Daniel was just hiding in a closet, too afraid to come out.  Daniel was the more introverted of the two Mauser children. He was a voracious reader who loved science and math. He ran cross-country and was in both the debate and chess clubs. He was \"coming into his own,\" Christine says, and at the time of his death was earning straight As.  Unlike her brother, who didn't like to be filmed or photographed, Christine was into acting and enjoyed being on stage. She surrounded herself with a bigger group of friends than he did. They bickered, as siblings do, and she admits she could be the annoying little sister. She laughs remembering the time she recorded him talking to friends, and then passed over the evidence so her parents could hear him saying bad words.  No matter their differences, they loved each other. Photos from their childhood reveal two towheads, laughing beside one another.  Reality hit the next day around noon, when officials showed up at the family home. \"They told us my brother was among the dead,\" Christine says. \"I don't really remember anything they said after that.\"  In an instant, she became an only child. It was a role she hated, not least of all because she couldn't bear to see her parents in so much pain. For a while, she insisted that a friend sleep over every night.  \"It sounds horrible, but you almost don't want to be alone with your parents,\" she says, \"because watching them go through that is the worst thing in the world.\"  Her father, Tom Mauser, doesn't remember how he and his wife spoke to Christine during this time, but he knows they struggled. \"It was a major problem for us,\" he says. \"It's not something you're prepared for. ... I don't think I had the words or knew how to counsel her.\" Plus, they felt like the world had crashed on their shoulders. They had a child who was still alive, thank God, and turned their focus to their grief.  At first the kids in school showered her with kindness -- even stuffed animals. But they couldn't really look her in the eye. Truth is, she didn't want them to. She had changed overnight. \"I remember just how awkward I felt, and how different I felt,\" she says.  And in middle school, being different can mean trouble. There were students who stared, watching her every move. If she cracked a joke or laughed in a desperate attempt to feel human, they looked at her stunned. On field trips, if the school bus rolled past Columbine High, their heads whipped around to monitor her reaction. She refused to be a mess in front of them, but the more she tried to act normal, the weirder she seemed -- which only increased the gawking, her anxiety and, eventually, their bullying.  She withdrew from others and gave up the stage. After Columbine, the last thing she wanted was to be the center of attention.  It wasn't that she was \"all sunshine and rainbows\" before her brother's killing, but she emerged someone else. Irrational fears consumed her, as did an obsession with death. Like many children who lose a sibling, she convinced herself she wouldn't live beyond the age her brother died. The trauma of losing a sibling to gun violence can arrest emotional and physical development. It can also complicate or delay grief. One expert describes how surviving siblings are affected -- and how friends and family can help.  She knew her concerns were illogical and didn't want to alarm anyone, so she kept her dark thoughts to herself. Still, rumors circulated at school that she was going to kill herself.  Christine couldn't articulate what she needed and wanted. Sometimes she felt like she and her parents walked around their house on eggshells.  Her mother, an introvert like Daniel, often retreated. Her father became an activist, rallying for better background checks and protesting the National Rifle Association. While she was proud of his work, it brought new forms of unwanted attention. She answered the phone when the first hate call came in and was cussed out by a stranger.  Some kids at school lectured her about the Second Amendment and told her what her dad was doing was wrong.  \"I was so taken aback I just didn't know what to say.\"  Near the end of middle school, when being there became unbearable, she was pulled out and home schooled for the rest of the year. There was no way she could attend Columbine High, so she was given a special provision to attend high school outside the district. She craved anonymity. She needed people to know her for who she was -- and not for what her family had been through. By 17, she says she began to find her footing again. A big part in helping Christine and her family was Madeline, the 11-month-old baby they adopted from China a little more than a year after they lost Daniel. When her parents first proposed the idea of adoption, Christine was immediately on board.  Madeline proved a bright light in the darkness, a needed bundle of pure joy. \"We still felt a lot of the same pain and heartache and everything like that, but she was kind of just a different force,\" Christine says. \"I was so grateful to have her there and to be a big sister.\"  No matter the positive forces and the years, however, Columbine doesn't go away.  A book by one of the gunman's mothers was released this year. Random Facebook friend requests pop up from people she calls \"Columbine groupies.\" She ignores them all, but feels sickened by those who use images of the killers as their profile photos.  Though married and a stepmother, she recalls those awkward moments from her single days when dates -- having Googled her -- would bring up Columbine. This piece of her past also resurfaces in a flood of emotions every time there's another school shooting. After the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, she couldn't eat for days.  When her stepdaughter, Bethany, mentioned having \"intruder training\" at school, she held her tongue. The 9-year-old explained it was done in case \"a robber comes to your school.\" Christine didn't have the heart to tell her the truth. Christine still holds onto Daniel's copy of J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye.\" It's stamped in the back with \"English Resource Center Columbine High School.\" She didn't go to that school, nor does her sister Madeline, who's now 16. All these years later, her parents still can't bear to pick up a child there. Her brother has been gone longer than he was here, and Christine feels as if she's lived two lives. She's not who she was when she lost him. When she sees adult siblings being best friends, she can't help but feel a bit bitter. She can't help but wonder what might have been had Daniel lived.  -- Jessica Ravitz, CNN", "'She never fell in love' A sister's accidental shooting death, 2013  Upstairs, Madisson \"Madi\" Mohler sits in her new room, the very one that belonged to her big sister, Brooklynn. She only moved in a few months ago and around her are reminders of who she lost.  Barbies Brooklynn once collected line shelves above the bed, right near her dangling dream catcher. There's the poster of puppies the animal-lover wouldn't leave Target without owning. Butterflies, wind chimes and pompoms are strung across the ceiling.  And by the window is Brooklynn's bulletin board, crowded with a collection of inspirational sayings she jotted down not long before she died. \"Add life to your days, not days to your life,\" reads one. \"Don't give up,\" says another. \"I'd rather have a life of 'oh wells' than a life of 'what ifs,'\" reads a third.  These notes, most now faded by the sun and time, turned out to be a gift to her family. It was one they desperately needed because nothing could have prepared them for what took Brooklynn away.  Three years ago, Brooklynn was at her best friend's house when her friend began messing with an unsecured 9 mm Glock. As Brooklynn walked away, a response she'd been taught, the gun fired. A bullet tore through her spine before puncturing her lung and then her heart. She died soon after. She had just turned 13.  \"I looked up to her like she was a hero,\" says Madi, who was only 9 at the time.", "Levi and Madi Mohler say Brooklynn, left, was the bridge between them. Brooklynn often played teacher in their Henderson, Nevada, home, and Madi was happy to be her student. She remembers being schooled on vowels and similes. Her big sister liked Carrie Underwood, so she did, too. They competed with each other in the Wii game \"Just Dance.\" Both gymnasts, Brooklynn insisted Madi do conditioning exercises during TV commercials. Madi did as she was told, launching into quick workouts or dropping into splits.  Madi was with her dad and one of his friends when they went to pick up Brooklynn from her friend's house. She knew something was wrong; her father went inside, which was strange, and then an ambulance pulled up. A police officer arrived and told her dad's friend to take Madi away. She thought someone had broken an arm or something.  A while later, her aunt took Madi to the hospital.  \"I remember going into the lobby and my dad had to tell me and [my brother] what happened,\" Madi says. \"My mom was in a separate room called 'the quiet room' and my aunt ran in there and I just heard crying and screaming.\" The house then filled with family and tears. She was overwhelmed and not sure what to make of it all. An uncle bought Madi a cake pop maker to keep her occupied. When she ran out of ingredients, someone screamed to go buy her more. So she dutifully kept making those cake pops. Madi, now 13, laughs, saying she made \"too many to remember.\"  Too old to be distracted by cake pops was Levi, the only son. He was 16. Now 19 and in college, he still struggles with blaming himself.  \"I always felt it was my job to keep her safe. And when that happened, I just felt destroyed,\" he says. \"I could've prevented it.\" When some boys were picking on Brooklynn in middle school, Levi showed up to escort her home and scare them off. When she once wanted to walk to Taco Bell with a friend while wearing a swimsuit, he was quick to shut that idea down. She never got in trouble, and he jokes that he \"set the example of what not to do.\" The other gun lobby They are, sadly, growing in number: Americans devastated by gun violence.

See the visual story of gun violence in America.  Levi didn't like Brooklynn's friend, the one who accidentally fired the gun. From the moment he met her, he says, there was something about that girl he didn't trust. Maybe, instead of going to her house after school that day, he could have insisted Brooklynn come home with him?  When he heard she'd been shot, he thought to himself, \"Oh, we're going to joke about this 10 years from now.\" On the way to the hospital, he imagined showing his kids Aunt Brooklynn's little scar from that crazy time she took a bullet. But after his trot into the hospital turned into a run and he rounded the corner to see his father, he backed against a wall and sunk to the floor. The last time Levi had seen his dad cry like this was after they put down their German shepherd, Baron. Back home, he remembers their mother holing up in her bedroom as people streamed in and out to see her. He retreated to his own room, where the thought of food or drink made him sick. When he emerged, he says he felt like he had to be strong for his mom and Madi. Sometimes he'd just hold his mom as she wept, fighting to hold back his own tears. \"I tried to be strong for her,\" he says, now crying. \"It was really hard.\"  With his father, he says, he was able to \"go out back and kind of hug it out.\"  Jacob Mohler says he'd be lying if he said he was the best father he could be in the first six months or even year after Brooklynn died. He had walked into the house where Brooklynn was shot minutes after it happened. He held her as she struggled to breathe. \"It was a blessing and a curse,\" he says. \"I got to be with my baby in her darkest hour, but the things I see when I close my eyes -- I wouldn't wish on anybody.\"  Today, he likes to say, \"Deal with your grief or your grief will deal with you.\"  It's a philosophy shared by his wife, Darchel, who knows too well what it's like to lose a sibling. Her younger sister Tessa died in a car wreck at 17. But Darchel not only lost her, she also lost her mother to grief. \"I thought at the time that would be the worst thing I'd ever have to go through,\" says Darchel, who was 26 and pregnant with Madi at the time. \"I can empathize with my children. ... And I understand my mother more now.\"  She was determined to be present for her kids, even if emotionally she had checked out, and to make this house a safe space to cry and feel.  Madi goes to a grief group with other kids her age. The first day they met, they wrote down what made them mad and then set those words on fire -- before making s'mores. They do crafts \"dedicated to our lost one,\" she explains. She's made a Valentine's card for Brooklynn, decorated candy canes and made a new dream catcher.  Down the hall, in her mother's office, there's a painting by Madi. It features two girls, side-by-side, with tears running down their cheeks. Atop one are the words, \"I miss you Sissy.\" The other girl, almost identical, wears angel's wings.  Sometimes relatives will say things like, \"You'll grow up to be just like Brooklynn,\" Madi says. And while she'd like to be like her sister, she says, \"I'm not like her. I want to be my own self.\"  Levi balked at the idea of counseling in the beginning. He was sure he could handle it on his own. He played on the football and lacrosse teams and channeled his feelings onto the field.  He'd look for big hits, he says. He got concussions but never told anyone. He played a whole football season with a broken wrist. Even on his violin, an instrument Brooklynn took up so she could be like him, he poured his heart into his music, using that same broken wrist.  Today, he's not ashamed to see a counselor. He's even thinking he might become one himself. When he needs a good cry, he often turns to music. Cole Swindell's, \"You Should Be Here,\" helps bring up lots of stuff, he says. Sometimes he'll even listen to Brooklynn's playlist, including her \"stupid little boy band artists\" -- the very music that used to make him scream, \"Turn that off!\" when he heard it through the wall between their bedrooms.  About a year after her death, the family established the Brooklynn Mae Mohler Foundation. Its mission is to push for responsible gun ownership and encourage parents to ask other parents if they have unsecured firearms in their homes. In Brooklynn's name, they host runs and set up tables at community events to raise awareness. It's a mission, Levi says, that helped bring the family together, offered them purpose and allowed them to really talk about Brooklynn.  \"It was probably the best thing that we could've done,\" he says.  The scars, however, still run deep.  Darchel, who was already plenty overprotective before Brooklynn died, is an even more nervous mother. Just ask Madi.  \"I don't have as much freedom as I would like,\" she says. \"I can't really go over to other friends' houses because of my mother's anxiety. But it's cool because my friends get to come over here, and personally I think it's more fun over here. I feel safe in my own house.\"  And Levi, who never suffered from anxiety before, says he now suffers from it \"like crazy.\" A glass half-full guy before, he's now prone to fixating on worst-case scenarios.  His worrying, he thinks, helped drive a girlfriend away. He needed to know where she was all the time and that she was safe. \"She didn't quite understand it and I didn't expect her to,\" he says, as he wipes away new tears. \"I did love her, and it would kill me if something happened to her. ... It would kill me to lose someone again.\"  He understands his mother's overprotectiveness. When other friends were getting their driver's licenses, he held off until he was 18. His mother couldn't handle the thought of him driving off. \"I'll take the bus. It's OK. Don't worry,\" he remembers saying. \"I'll get my license when you're ready for me to.\"  Such milestones make him think of Brooklynn. Moments that should be joyous carry a sting.  \"She never fell in love. She never got her driver's license. She didn't graduate high school,\" he says. \"She never got to go play a varsity sport, never got to go to prom.\"  When his thoughts turn to Madi, though, his words carry a different weight. Levi says he and his younger sister grew distant after Brooklynn was gone.  \"I don't know if that's normal,\" he says, \"but this is what happened.\" Madi has no illusions about this either.  \"There's such a big age difference. We don't really talk a whole lot,\" Madi says. \"But I kind of want that to change because I don't like not talking to my brother.\"  With Brooklynn, they had a bridge that bound them. She was the consummate middle child. She was, as her parents describe, the hub to their family wheel.  Now, three years after a bullet took her away, her two surviving siblings must find their own connection.  -- Jessica Ravitz, CNN", "'He was my role model' A gang prank and a brother gone, 2006 Tre Bosley holds a blue candle and walks in silence with more than 100 others protesting the violence that plagues Chicago's South Side.  Tre is an impressive young man, a high school basketball star with a stellar GPA who leads an anti-violence youth group.  Beneath his bright smile and optimistic outlook is a teen who knows the despair of the city's mounting death toll. Tre was just 8 when his older brother, Terrell was killed in a gang prank a decade ago.  Terrell was 18, a motivated young man who shunned the gang life for church choir. Pinned to Tre's chest is a button bearing his brother's image. A reminder of why he keeps fighting.  \"He was my role model -- truly a role model,\" Tre says.  Saving lives has become Tre's mission. He has known about a dozen people who've been killed, from his brother to a cousin to a special needs teacher. Tre takes his message -- and his button -- everywhere he travels. Earlier this year, he was far from his South Side neighborhood, standing face-to-face with President Barack Obama during a town hall on gun control.  \"My question to you is: What is your advice to those growing up surrounded by poverty and gun violence?\" Tre asked at the end of the event.  Obama looked at him. \"When I see you, I think about my own youth because I wasn't that different from you -- probably not as articulate and maybe more of a goof-off, but the main difference was I lived in a more forgiving environment.\" The President told Tre not to give up hope, to keep being a role model, to work hard, to strive for great things through education. \"But what I also want to say to you is that you're really important to the future of this country.\" The President's words touched Tre in unexpected ways. \"He kinda told me that I'm the future -- not only me, but the youth are the future of this country,\" he says. \"It really inspired me.\"", "Terrell Bosley with brothers Terrez, left, and Tre. \"He was my role model,\" Tre says of Terrell. Before his brother was killed, Tre used to dream big. Like of becoming the president of the country or heading up a major company. But in the years after, he says, \"I kind of diminished my goals.\" It was more about surviving day to day. There were few African-American role models in his neighborhood.  His mother became more protective. He wasn't allowed to leave his block. She drove him to school. A nearby basketball court was off limits. \"She doesn't let us walk there or go play or nothing,\" he says. \"We really stay on that one portion of the block all the time.\" Even there, playing basketball in an alley, he can hear gunshots. Tre remembers everything \"very clearly, actually\" from April 4, 2006. How could he ever forget that day? He was studying math with his father in the front room of their home. His mother took a phone call, then screamed: \"Terrell's been shot!\"  His books fell to the floor and everyone ran from the home. They hopped in the car and rushed to Terrell's side.  Terrell sang in a community choir and played the bass at various churches around Chicago. He was helping a friend take drums into a church when shots rang out. He was hit once in the shoulder. A friend was hit multiple times, but survived.  The family was later told that one gang member had played a prank on another, saying Terrell was a member of a rival gang. \"When he shot them, the other guy said, 'I was just kidding,'\" mother Pam Bosley says. \"You mean to tell me my son is gone because of some joke?!\" Tre watched his brother get loaded into an ambulance and rushed to the hospital, sirens blaring. His mom was crying, so were he and his other brother, Terrez, then 13. \"My mom was telling us to pray -- just keep praying, make sure that you keep praying.\" At the hospital, he and Terrez watched from a waiting area as a doctor told their parents Terrell had died. The room filled with wails and tears. Their dad \"came and told us, and we started crying.\" Tre thought about the time Terrell beat him in checkers. He had promised he'd beat his older brother one day. \"Just knowing I'd never be able to do that -- at first, it hurt. \"At that moment in the hospital, I didn't truly know what was going on. It just felt like a dream.\" Terrell had been his idol. He kept the talkative, overconfident young Tre grounded. Told him not to be so boisterous with his smack-talk.  One of Tre's favorite memories was sitting with Terrell in his car listening to music. Tre didn't have much rhythm, so Terrell tried to demonstrate: \"He was like, 'Look you should bob your head like this. Not like that! It's got to be on the beat.\" Tre laughs. All these years later, that memory brings a smile. \"I'll never forget the moment he taught me how to bob my head.\" Other memories race back, like when they'd drive together to school. \"We used to pray in the car on my way to school. We'd pray that no one else would get harmed. We prayed every day to keep our family safe and that no one gets shot and killed in our family. \"That was before he got killed. Then, I started to pray by myself.\" Terrell was killed just before Easter. For years after, the family stopped celebrating holidays. They'd stay in a hotel for Christmas because the grief at home was too overbearing. Terrell had loved Christmas; he'd go over the top with decorating the house, inside and out.  Only in the last couple of years has the family been able to celebrate Christmas at home. Tre had begged his mother to allow them. \"We just started putting a tree back up,\" he says.  For now, it's the only decoration.  \"On Christmas, when you're getting your gifts, you just know that there's supposed to be somebody else getting their gifts,\" he says. \"I always feel like something is missing. You never feel like the holidays are complete.\" His mom has filled some of the void of Terrell's absence -- thrusting him into activism and making sure he kept up with his studies. Now 18, Tre graduated with a 4.2 GPA and will attend college on scholarship. Tre also credits his pastor, the Rev. Michael Pfleger, the fiery priest of Saint Sabina who has been a community activist for decades.  Pfleger says all too often parents turn to alcohol or drugs after losing a child -- and surviving siblings get lost amid the grief. He praises Tre's parents for keeping him on the right path, and he says Tre's perseverance and positive attitude played a major part in shaping who he is today.  \"He's got a great blend of a strength and a sensitivity that I've always admired,\" Pfleger says. It would have been \"easy for him to become either angry or bitter after losing his brother, or to turn to the streets or live in fear after that. Instead, he made a decision to join with his parents ... and put his emotional pain, hurt and trauma into trying to be a voice for other young people.\" Tre serves as the president of The BRAVE Youth Leaders, an anti-violence organization that goes into the community, delivering a message of peace. They also help with mentoring and voter registration. BRAVE stands for Bold Resistance Against Violence Everywhere. He likes the Black Lives Matter movement and appreciates its efforts, but he wishes it would \"address black on black crime as much as they do police brutality.\" \"I mean: How can they expect to give us justice for those killings when we don't even expect justice for our own killings?\" His brother's killer has not been caught.  Still, meeting Obama has inspired Tre to fight even harder for change and for equality for all.  \"Knowing that your role model is gone and I'm still trying to follow his footsteps,\" Tre says, \"I know (my brother) would be proud of me for what I did and what I said.\" He pauses. \"I think that's my response to everything that happened to me after my brother. My response was I need to go out and make a change so that other people won't go through what I went through.\" Terrell would be proud in other ways, too. On what would've been Terrell's 28th birthday, Tre played in a high school basketball game. Under his jersey, he wore a T-shirt commemorating his brother's life.  On the court, Tre couldn't be stopped. He caught fire, hitting five 3-pointers. \"I know I played well because he was looking down, and he helped me out that game.\" Again, Tre lights up. -- Wayne Drash, CNN"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

All else, press ban included, is designed to deflect attention                         \u2018Any investigation involving Trump advisers and Russian intelligence is serious stuff. If borne out, it has the potential to become the greatest political scandal in American history.\u2019 Photograph: Dmitri Lovetsky/AP", "Narrative switching. That is what the Trump administration is desperately trying to do around Russia right now. The White House reportedly interfered with the FBI in the middle of an active investigation involving counter-intelligence. This was not only foolhardy but also suspicious, as it directly undermined their apparent objective: distracting us. On 14 February, the New York Times reported that advisers and associates of Donald Trump may have been in direct and continuous contact with officers of the Russian intelligence agency, the FSB, during a tumultuous election campaign in which the American democracy itself was hacked. A major party \u2013 now in opposition \u2013 was the victim of an unprecedented cyber-attack.  According to the Times, intercepted telephone calls and phone records indicated to American counter-intelligence officers direct contact with the Russians.  The stakes are high. Most Democrats and more than a few Republicans believe this investigation could unearth details that could plunge the nation into a political and constitutional crisis not seen since the secession of the South in 1860 and 1861.  The Trump administration has repeatedly denied the characterization and defended the campaign\u2019s conduct. However, its denials have always been couched in the most legalistic terms and each falls apart with every new revelation. It doesn\u2019t help that Trump himself calls the allegations \u201cfake news\u201d then validates the reporting by attacking the leaks \u2013 suggesting that they are true.  Now, thanks to CNN, we learned on Thursday that Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, had reportedly contacted the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, and requested that the bureau publicly characterize the Times story as not being serious \u2013 in McCabe\u2019s reported words, \u201ctotal BS\u201d.  When this was rebuffed by McCabe, Priebus reportedly went to the FBI director, James Comey, who allegedly also refused to comment publicly. Priebus then allegedly asked both if he could quote them anonymously as \u201ctop intelligence officials\u201d, saying the story was totally wrong. According to CNN, McCabe and Comey agreed to let him do that, despite the fact that the FBI and the White House are prohibited from communicating about open investigations. The White House then turned to other intelligence officials and to members of Congress. According to the Washington Post, House and Senate intelligence committee chairs Devin Nunes and Richard Burr were asked to push back against Russian stories that did not favor the administration. They told the Post they did so. No matter what the contention, the fundamental fact exists that the FBI, based on McCabe\u2019s and Comey\u2019s remarks, has inadvertently verified that there is, in fact, a counter-intelligence investigation going on involving the associates of the president. Until now the investigation had only been reported through anonymous sources. This bungled attempt to manage the media reveals the fear in the White House: that there may actually be a smoking gun that ties Trump to Moscow\u2019s hacking.  It is always possible that Trump\u2019s then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, former adviser Carter Page and others may have been in contact with Russians as part of foreign policy development. But given the political environment in the summer of 2016, after the hack of the Democratic National Committee, it is very hard to believe that any continuous and repeated contact with the Kremlin was completely innocent.  Priebus\u2019s clumsy attempt to perform perception management judo only added fuel to the fire. Then it was raked over with Trump\u2019s often incomprehensible flamethrower rhetoric when he declared CNN reporting \u201cfake news\u201d and had them banned, with the New York Times and other outlets including the Guardian, from a press gaggle on Friday.  Any investigation involving Trump advisers and Russian intelligence is serious stuff. If borne out, it has the potential to become the greatest political scandal in American history. But this meddling by the White House is one step too far. It is not typical Washington pushback. It smacks of a strategy of cover-up.  It is high time for the House and Senate to form independent select subcommittees to ferret out the truth. The key questions are simple. What did Trump and his staff know about the hacks? When did they know it and were they complicit in any way?  If American citizens worked alongside a foreign power to interfere in American democracy, it must be found out and quickly. It is crucial to retain the trust in our president and the electoral process. The stakes are nothing less than the legitimacy of American liberal democracy.

Now Ailes is vigorously denying her accusations and Fox's parent company is conducting an \"internal review.\"   Carlson, 50, was removed from her 2 p.m. newscast \"The Real Story\" in late June. The lawsuit said she was terminated for \"refusing Ailes' sexual advances.\"   But Ailes said in a Wednesday evening statement that the allegations are \"false.\"   \"This is a retaliatory suit for the network's decision not to renew her contract, which was due to the fact that her disappointingly low ratings were dragging down the afternoon lineup,\" he said. \"When Fox News did not commence any negotiations to renew her contract, Ms. Carlson became aware that her career with the network was likely over and conveniently began to pursue a lawsuit.\"   Earlier in the day, Carlson's attorney Nancy Erika Smith, of the firm Smith Mullin, told CNNMoney that the lawsuit \"didn't begin with her termination.\"   Smith asserted that Ailes' harassment was \"very consistent and very pervasive.\"   In the hours since the lawsuit was announced, \"at least ten\" other women have contacted the law firm, wanting to speak about Ailes' treatment, according to a spokesman for the firm.   Smith emphasized that Carlson is only suing Ailes, not the network, but the lawsuit also describes \"sexist\" treatment from a fellow Fox host, Steve Doocy.   Just before Ailes spoke out, his bosses -- Rupert Murdoch and the two Murdoch sons who run 21st Century Fox -- issued a corporate statement.   \"The Company has seen the allegations against Mr. Ailes and Mr. Doocy,\" the statement said. \"We take these matters seriously.

He said Fox News \"provided her with more on-air opportunities over her 11 year tenure than any other employer in the industry, for which she thanked me in her recent book.\"   His statement concluded, \"This defamatory lawsuit is not only offensive, it is wholly without merit and will be defended vigorously.\"   The lawsuit is a bombshell that could have serious consequences for Fox. In the tight-knit, ultra-competitive television business, there was immediate speculation about whether other women at Fox would come forward to back up Carlson's claims.   Ailes, now 76, founded Fox News in 1996 and has run the network with an iron fist ever since, with employees famously loyal to him. He signed another multi-year contract last year.   Ailes is known for having a bawdy, politically incorrect sense of humor. But Carlson's lawsuit alleges that he went much further with her.   It alleges that Ailes repeatedly \"injected sexual and/or sexist comments\" into conversations; made \"sexual advances by various means;\" and said to her last September, \"I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago and then you'd be good and better and I'd be good and better.\"   The suit says Carlson requested the September meeting because she was seeking to \"bring to an end the retaliatory and discriminatory treatment she had endured.\"   Instead, the suit alleges, the \"retaliation\" continued through June, when her contract was not renewed.   The eight-page lawsuit, filed with the Superior Court of New Jersey on Wednesday, specifically alleges that Ailes violated the New York City Human Rights Law.   Asked whether Carlson has any recordings or other evidence, Smith said, \"We are very confident in our evidence. We have very powerful evidence. But we don't want to discuss what the evidence is outside of the courtroom.\"   Smith said that the 2014 book about Fox and Ailes, \"The Loudest Voice in the Room,\" by Gabriel Sherman, contains other accusations of sexual harassment by Ailes.   \"The law is very clear that other victims' testimony is relevant in a sexual harassment case... We may be asking these other women to testify,\" she said.   At the same time the lawsuit was announced, Carlson wrote on Facebook, \"As you may have heard, I am no longer with Fox News. I value your support and friendship, especially now, so please stay in touch with me.\"   In a statement, she called the lawsuit \"a difficult step to take,\" but said, \"I had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace.\"   Carlson, a Stanford graduate and a former Miss America, joined Fox News in 2005 after five years at CBS. She hosted the channel's flagship morning show \"Fox & Friends\" before being reassigned to the 2 p.m. hour.   In the complaint, Carlson's attorneys also spelled out what they said was \"sexist and condescending\" treatment that she experienced at the hands of another coworker: her longtime \"Fox & Friends\" co-host Steve Doocy.   Doocy, the complaint alleges, \"engaged in a pattern and practice of severe and pervasive sexual harassment of Carlson, including, but not limited to, mocking her during commercial breaks, shunning her off air, refusing to engage with her on air, belittling her contributions to the show, and generally attempting to put her in her place by refusing to accept and treat her as an intelligent and insightful female journalist rather than a blond female prop.\"   In response to Carlson's complaints about Doocy, Ailes allegedly called Carlson a \"man hater\" and \"killer,\" and admonished her to \"get along with the boys.\"   That episode happened in 2009, according to the complaint. In 2013, the complaint claims, Ailes moved Carlson from the morning show to the 2 p.m. hour as \"further retaliation for her refusal to accede to sexual harassment and retaliation.\"   The ratings for Carlson's program \"The Real Story\" were, by Fox standards, relatively weak, even though the numbers are up year-over-year thanks to the election news cycle.   Executives at Fox were well aware that the program had been falling behind CNN in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic.   \"The Real Story\" has been hosted by fill-ins in the days since her contract was not renewed.   On Wednesday it was hosted by 5 p.m. co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who made no mention of the controversy.   Meanwhile, Carlson's biography was taken off of the Fox News web site.   --Tom Kludt contributed to this report.

Trump, as he does, touched on a wide variety of subjects -- from Kelly to the special counsel investigation to FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. And more! I scoured the transcript and flagged a handful of the most notable lines from the President. They're below. 1. \"How's he doing, OK? I think by the way he's doing great.\" Read More Trump wanders into a meeting between his chief of staff and a bunch of reporters. First question: You guys like this guy? So, so Trump-y. 2. \"Fake news yesterday, or two days ago. I rarely put out a tweet, praising somebody, but only when they get a false story.\" Trump is referring to a Vanity Fair piece published Monday that alleged Kelly and the President were on the outs. Also, Trump \"rarely\" puts out a tweet \"praising somebody.\" Same, honestly. 3. \"I don't even know if he saw that stuff, but I put it out.\" If a tweet falls in the forest... 4. \"Nice to see you all. The economy is doing very well.\" Non sequitur, Donald Trump. President Trump, non sequitur. 5. \"I'm going to Davos to get them to bring back a lot of money.\" Wait. They give away money at Davos? So that's why people love it so much! 6. \"Thank you for some of the nice things you've said over the recent past.\" I'm not sure which reporter Trump is referring to but it doesn't matter. The point here is a) he is hyper-aware of media coverage of him and b) his feelings about reporters are entirely tied to whether or not they have written nice things about him of late. 7. \"We're going to get the wall, we're going to get great border security.\" Well, I'm convinced! 8. \"Over a period of 10-12 years, somebody does a great job, they've worked hard, it gives incentive to do a great job.\" BIG news here. Trump is saying that Dreamers will have a path to citizenship after \"10-12 years.\" People like Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, seized on this comment as a sign Trump is committed to finding a workable solution on the immigration issue. But, if past is prologue, Trump could well say something totally different within a day or two. 9. \"If they do a great job, I think it's a nice thing to have the incentive of, after a period of years, being able to become a citizen.\" While floating a path to citizenship is obviously a big deal, notice the fuzziness built into Trump's answer. How is the judgment of \"do a great job\" made? And by whom? 10. \"Yeah, I might do that. I might do that.\" This is Trump responding to a question on whether he might extend the DACA deadline if Congress can't reach a deal on the program by March. Classic cliffhanger for the reality TV star. Stay tuned for next week's episode! 11. \"But chain, where we get the lottery system is a broken system, they put people in a lottery.\" I mean, your guess is as good as mine. 12. \"They're not putting their finest in that system, you would not be in that system.\" \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you.\" -- Donald Trump, June 16, 2015. 13. \"Well it has to go in a very strong form, absolutely, and I think even the Democrats know that the lottery system is not good, it's a bad, it's a bad system.\" Lottery system: Not good. Bad. Got it? 14. \"We want to have a good strong family and we're going to treat people very well.\" This seems sensible. 15. \"When you have a mountain, you don't build a wall, OK?\" I think Socrates first said that. 16. \"When you have a river that is un-crossable, that you cannot cross, you don't build a wall, OK?\" \"We'd go down to the river/And into the river we'd dive/Oh down to the river we'd ride\" -- The Boss 17. \"So I think we're gonna be very successful, but no, Schumer -- well, I can tell you this: if you don't have a wall, you don't have DACA.\" So, here we are. Earlier this week Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, took wall funding off the table as part of a DACA deal. And now Trump says that without wall funding, there is no DACA. This is fine. 18. \"I like him! I like him! I grew up with Schumer.\" \"Cryin' Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA. We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!\" -- Donald Trump, Tuesday night 19. \"Tell them not to be concerned, OK? Tell them not to worry about it, we're gonna solve the problem.\" Relax, Dreamers. Just chill. The Donald's got this. 20. \"But we're saving hundreds of millions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, by building that wall.\" Um, is it millions or billions? Because, well, there's a big difference. 21. \"In the initial, we're putting chain, a negotiated chain, we're putting a replacement for lottery or an end to lottery, and it could be a replacement, we bring people in from various countries, that come in based on merit and various other reasons, and we are going to build a wall.\" This is one sentence. It is 51 words long. 22. \"There has been no collusion whatsoever. There's no obstruction whatsoever.\" No collusion! No obstruction! No surrender! 23. \"I would love to do it. You know, again, I have to say, subject to my lawyers and all of that, but I would love to do it.\" This is Trump on talking to special counsel Robert Mueller. My guess is his lawyers were, um, not happy that Trump said this without checking with them. 24. \"I think you have an idea. Do you not have an idea? Do you REALLY not have an idea? I'll give you an idea: she didn't do it under oath. But I would do it under oath.\" Trump is referring here to Hillary Clinton's 2016 interview with the FBI during the organization's investigation into her use of a private email server. Clinton was not put under oath and there was no transcript of her interview created, according to then-FBI Director James Comey. 25. \"If you didn't know about Hillary, then you're not much of a reporter.\" Boom. Roasted. 26. \"I mean, I am very disturbed, as is the general, as is everybody else that is intelligent.\" Trump's response to whether or not he trusts the FBI is stunning. He is the President! This is the FBI! 27. \"When you look at five months, this is the late great Rose Mary Woods, right? A step. This is a large scale version.\" To be clear what Trump is doing here: He is equating the fact that the FBI is missing texts for a 5-month period from December 2016 to May 2017 with the allegedly accidental erasing of more than 18 minutes of White House recordings -- just days after the Watergate break-in -- by Nixon secretary Rose Mary Woods. Also, we learned Wednesday that it's not just texts from two FBI officials who expressed anti-Trump sentiments that were lost. It was the text messages from one in every 10 FBI phones. So... 28. \"Well McCabe got more than $500,000 from essentially Hillary Clinton, and is he investigating Hillary Clinton?\" Nope! McCabe's wife, when she was a candidate for state Senate in 2015, got a $467,000 contribution from a super PAC associated with then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Yes, McAuliffe is a longtime friend of the Clintons. But he is not, in fact, Hillary Clinton. 29. \"Now Terry is Hillary.\" Who wants to tell him? 30. \"I don't think so. No. I don't think so.\" Trump is responding here to a report in The Washington Post that he asked then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe who he voted for during a meeting shortly after Trump fired Comey. You don't have to be a word sleuth to realize that Trump isn't exactly denying it. 31. \"I don't know what's the big deal with that, because I would ask you who you voted for, who did you vote for?\" \"How about this weather, huh?\" \"Yes, it's beautiful.\" \"How are the kids?\" \"Crazy, like always.\" \"So, did you vote for me in the election, or no?\" 32. \"I only repeat, I only repeat for the purposes of making sure you understand.\" Same. 33. \"No collusion. There's no collusion.\" None. Zero. Zippy. Nada. Zilch. 34. \"There's no collusion.\" This is not the same quote. He just said it again. Like 10 words after he said it the last time. 35. \"I was one of the greatest candidates.\" This feels like a good place to end."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Al-Shabab asserted responsibility for the attack. (Thomas Mukoya/Reuters)  On June 14, the terrorist group al-Shabab \u2014 an al-Qaeda affiliate \u2014 attacked a pizza restaurant in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, by detonating a car bomb and sending in assailants. More than 30 people were killed. Earlier in June, al-Shabab overran a military base in the semiautonomous area of Puntland, killing dozens. The group recently surpassed Boko Haram as the deadliest terrorist organization in Africa. But it\u2019s not the violence that\u2019s attracting followers. My recent field research in Kenya and Somalia, the two East African countries where al-Shabab is most active, suggests that al-Shabab is thriving because it\u2019s still offering a comparatively attractive alternative to the Somali government. It capitalizes on grievances, keeps areas secure and settles disputes, with relatively little corruption. That\u2019s especially attractive in undeveloped or remote areas that the fledgling government has neglected. As a result, al-Shabab is becoming a shadow government, positioning itself as Somalia\u2019s champion of disenfranchised and marginalized clans. The United States has been increasing its military presence and expanding its rules of engagement in Somalia to counter al-Shabab. On June 11, the United States conducted its first strike under these new rules, destroying an al-Shabab training and command center, and then conducted a second strike on July 2, with still a third one on July 4. In March, at the urging of the Defense Department, the Trump administration designated Somalia as an \u201carea of active hostilities,\u201d which allows the United States to conduct offensive strikes that do not require interagency vetting. How strong is al-Shabab? To some, al-Shabab looks weakened. It no longer controls major cities or ports. Nor does it have the capacity to militarily recapture them. With those losses went ways to get resources. In addition, international action has reduced al-Shabab\u2019s profit from commodities such as charcoal. Once flush with fighters from all over the world, al-Shabab now recruits foreign fighters primarily from the region; foreign fighters no longer figure in the group\u2019s senior ranks. Al-Shabab has not launched a major terrorist attack outside Somalia since 2015. Though looking to relinquish responsibility to Somali security forces, African Union forces (known as the African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM) are there to support Somalia\u2019s new government, which won a national election in February. But al-Shabab has shown an impressive ability to adapt \u2014 and is positioned to not only survive, but to thrive. It has been territorially constrained by AMISOM \u2014 but it has overrun AMISOM forward operating bases (FOB), killing and injuring scores of troops and seizing arms, military vehicles and heavy weaponry. The group\u2019s forces are highly decentralized, but it can mass various units to launch an attack. Further, al-Shabab\u2019s intelligence apparatus, the Amniyat, has been disrupting life in the Somali capital with bombings, assassinations and targeted attacks. How common is such violence? So common that one person I interviewed in Mogadishu shrugged off a bombing earlier that day as \u201cSomali music.\u201d What about the group\u2019s presence in Kenya? It\u2019s true that al-Shabab has not carried out an attack in Kenya as large as its attacks on the Westgate mall or Garissa University since 2015. But in the past month, the group has launched IED attacks in Kenya\u2019s northeast and coastal areas. It\u2019s trying to stoke insecurity and widen communal fissures just weeks before the Kenyan elections, a time when tensions are high and there are heightened concerns about potential election-related violence. Al-Shabab functions as an effective local government  Al-Shabab has deftly managed clan dynamics and provided basic services in ways that have brought it political power and influence throughout southern Somalia, especially the rural areas, where residents are wary of the still-fragile government. That\u2019s what I found as I conducted interviews in Kenya and Somalia in January and in May and June this year. Security. Al-Shabab offers services that the government still does not, particularly to populations distrustful or excluded from the still-fragile political process. Al-Shabab offers a modicum of security in areas under its influence. It operates courts, including mobile courts, to punish crime and resolve disputes. That\u2019s especially important in an area rife with local conflicts, especially land disputes, and few effective ways to settle them, except violence. While media reports focus on al-Shabab\u2019s harsh sharia punishments, some Somalis seek out al-Shabab courts, knowing that they will deliver a relatively thorough verdict and will enforce resolution. Taxation. Al-Shabab has a remarkably effective taxation system that few dare to defy, even those living, as one person I interviewed put it, \u201ca stone\u2019s throw from an AMISOM FOB.\u201d That brings in a steady stream of revenue. What\u2019s more, al-Shabab is relatively uncorrupt and efficient. You can see that clearly on the roads that it controls, where it operates checkpoints that require set payments, offer a receipt to passengers, and keep the roads relatively safe. That contrasts sharply with how others, including government forces, manage roads, which are rife with predation and repeated extortion, which has both safety and economic repercussions \u2014 as I heard repeatedly from citizens, businesspeople and aid workers alike. Decentralized and embedded. Al-Shabab positions itself as a defender of disenfranchised and marginalized clans, expertly manipulating and capitalizing on local and clan grievances to gain support \u2014 including gathering the support of anti-government leaders and militias. This has caused the group to become more decentralized, integrating into local communities and permeating Somali society in a way that will make it increasingly difficult to distinguish civilians from combatants. This dispersed but relatively well-organized structure includes compartmentalized military, terrorism and intelligence apparatuses. Most of those captured can provide little intelligence beyond their narrow range of responsibilities. And everyone is aware that al-Shabab ruthlessly targets defectors and kills suspected spies. Al-Shabab finds ways to exploit the vacuum left by the state, tapping into a deep reservoir of grievances. It has both conventional military strength and terrorist abilities as well as political and ideological influence that goes beyond its territorial holdings. It has become the main alternative to the government. It will not be defeated by military means alone, and the fitful progress by the Somali government may come too little, too late.

We have various streams of events -- community service, common meals, contemplative practice, services, book discussions, speaker events, community action, and faith-and-science discussions. A few weekends ago, we decided to discuss Science Mike's Axioms for Faith which is part of his series on doubt. I want to share these with you because they can be extremely helpful for some of us dealing with doubt, and they can be extremely interesting for those of us looking at faith from a scientific lens. Due to the lively and deeply divided discussion my group had on the axioms, I want to preface your reading of the axioms with a few comments. Take a moment to look up what an axiom is in science or mathematics. In mathematics and science, axioms are independent and don't depend on one other. In contrast, some of these axioms will use terms or concepts from other axioms. That's ok; feel free to think of the axioms as a loose analogy. These axioms are not an evangelical, proselytic tool. They are not a tool to debate atheism versus theism. Rather, they are a tool that might possibly help a person of faith with doubt as she falls from certainty. Science Mike experienced it as a fence or barrier against complete loss of belief. Related to the previous two points, the axioms are scaffolded like a ladder. Imagine someone falling from faith. Before he falls completely away from faith, what is the last thing he could possibly hold on to? To think about it another way, if someone were falling away from faith, what is the first thing she could hold on to as she built it back up in a new way? The list is presented in that order. I invite you to give comments about how you would order the ladder from your experience. The axioms are not definitive, canonized statements of Christian faith. They are simply a tool that personally helped Mike in his personal faith journey. If it's useful for you, great. If it's not, discard it. The axioms are not perfect, and Mike says this himself. In fact, he invites help to improve him. You can send feedback to him. The term \"AT LEAST\" includes definitions that go beyond. This was a difficulty my group had in our discussion. Sometimes, for example if a person thought God was more than Mike's definition, she would call Mike's definition wrong. But these are \"at least\" statements (similar to '\u2265' in mathematics) which are still true if you feel the defined concept is inclusively greater than or more than the axiom. For instance, if I have an apple in my hand and say \"this object is at least a fruit,\" that is true even though we could specifically say it is more: it is an apple. However, if you feel the axiom or definition is not minimally true, that the concept (faith, God, prayer, etc.) does not, in any way, include the minimal axiomatic statement, feel free to disagree and comment. Remember, these axioms are the very least that science can verify about these concepts. The axioms, if accepted, do not necessarily lead to an \"orthodox,\" mainstream Western Christian faith. Mike says it probably leans more towards an Eastern Orthodox faith. Faith is AT LEAST a way to contextualize the human need for spirituality and find meaning in the face of mortality. EVEN IF this is all faith is, spiritual practice can be beneficial to cognition, emotional states, and culture. God is AT LEAST the natural forces that created and sustain the Universe as experienced via a psychosocial model in human brains that naturally emerges from innate biases. EVEN IF that is a comprehensive definition for God, the pursuit of this personal, subjective experience can provide meaning, peace, and empathy for others. Prayer is AT LEAST a form of meditation that encourages the development of healthy brain tissue, lowers stress, and can connect us to God. EVEN IF that is a comprehensive definition of prayer, the health and psychological benefits of prayer justify the discipline. Sin is AT LEAST volitional action or inaction that violates one's own understanding of what is moral. Sin comes from the divergent impulses between our lower and higher brain functions and our evolution-driven tendency to do things that serve ourselves and our tribe. EVEN IF this is all sin is, it is destructive and threatens human flourishing. The afterlife is AT LEAST the persistence of our physical matter in the ongoing life cycle on Earth, the memes we pass on to others with our lives, and the model of our unique neurological signature in the brains of those who knew us. EVEN IF this is all the afterlife is, the consequences of our actions persist beyond our death and our ethical considerations must consider a timeline beyond our death. Salvation is AT LEAST the means by which humanity overcomes sin to produce human flourishing. EVEN IF this is all salvation is, spiritual and religious actions and beliefs that promote salvation are good for humankind. Jesus is AT LEAST a man so connected to God that he was called the Son of God and the largest religious movement in human history is centered around his teachings. EVEN IF this is all Jesus is, following his teachings can promote peace, empathy, and genuine morality. The Holy Spirit is AT LEAST the psychological and neurological components of God that allow God to be experienced as a personal force or agent. EVEN IF this is all the Holy Spirit is, God is more relatable and neurologically actionable when experienced this way. The Church is AT LEAST the global community of people who choose to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. EVEN IF this is all the church is, the Church is still the largest body of spiritual scholarship, community, and faith practice in the world. The Bible is AT LEAST a collection of books and writings assembled by the Church that chronicle a people group's experiences with, and understanding of, God over thousands of years. EVEN IF that is a comprehensive definition of the Bible, study of scripture is warranted to understand our culture and the way in which people come to know God. Here are some questions to ponder. I'd love your feedback. For a person of complete religious and spiritual unbelief, how you would order these 10 concepts or axioms to create a ladder? Which axiom do you feel is the least controversial, most solid, and clearly obvious? Which axiom do you feel is the most controversial, most reasonably disputable, and least obvious?"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

By        BSIP/UIG/Getty Images", "The recent news that stents inserted in patients with heart disease to keep arteries open work no better than a placebo ought to be shocking. Each year, hundreds of thousands of American patients receive stents for the relief of chest pain, and the cost of the procedure ranges from $11,000 to $41,000 in US hospitals. But in fact, American doctors routinely prescribe medical treatments that are not based on sound science.  The stent controversy serves as a reminder that the United States struggles when it comes to winnowing evidence-based treatments from the ineffective chaff. As surgeon and health care researcher Atul Gawande observes, \u201cMillions of people are receiving drugs that aren\u2019t helping them, operations that aren\u2019t going to make them better, and scans and tests that do nothing beneficial for them, and often cause harm.\u201d  Of course, many Americans receive too little medicine, not too much. But the delivery of useless or low-value services should concern anyone who cares about improving the quality, safety and cost-effectiveness of medical care. Estimates vary about what fraction of the treatments provided to patients is supported by adequate evidence, but some reviews place the figure at under half.  Naturally that carries a heavy cost: One study found that overtreatment \u2014 one type of wasteful spending \u2014 added between $158 billion and $226 billion to US health care spending in 2011. The stunning news about stents came in a landmark study published in November, in The Lancet. It found that patients who got stents to treat nonemergency chest pain improved no more in their treadmill stress tests (which measure how long exercise can be tolerated) than did patients who received a \u201csham\u201d procedure that mimicked the real operation but actually involved no insertion of a stent. There were also no clinically important differences between the two groups in other outcomes, such as chest pain. (Before being randomized to receive the operation or the sham, all patients received six weeks of optimal medical therapy for angina, like beta blockers). Cardiologists are still debating the study\u2019s implications, and more research needs to be done, but it appears that patients are benefitting from the placebo effect rather than from the procedure itself. Once a treatment becomes popular, it\u2019s hard to dislodge Earlier cases in which researchers have called into question a common treatment suggest surgeons may push back against the stent findings. In 2002, The New England Journal of Medicine published a study demonstrating that a common knee operation, performed on millions of Americans who have osteoarthritis \u2014 an operation in which the surgeon removes damaged cartilage or bone (\u201carthroscopic debridement\u201d) and then washes out any debris (\u201carthroscopic lavage\u201d) \u2014 worked no better at relieving pain or improving function than a sham procedure. Those operations can go for $5,000 a shot.  Many orthopedic surgeons and medical societies disputed the study and pressed insurance companies to maintain coverage of the procedure. Subsequent research on a related procedure cast further doubt on the value of knee surgeries for many patients with arthritis or meniscal tears, yet the procedures remain in wide use.  Other operations that have continued to be performed despite negative research findings include spinal fusion (to ease pain caused by worn disks), and subacromial decompression, which in theory reduces shoulder pain.  There have been fitful efforts to improve the uptake of empirical studies of medical practices by doctors \u2014 one seemingly promising initiative being the \u201cChoosing Wisely\u201d campaign, launched in 2012 by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation in partnership with Consumer Reports. Its goal is to get medical societies to develop lists of treatments of minimal clinical benefit to patients. But Choosing Wisely seems to have had little impact so far. One study of that campaign\u2019s results examined seven procedures that have widely been shown to be ineffective, including imaging tests for \u201cuncomplicated\u201d headaches, cardiac imaging for patients without a history of heart problems, and routine imaging for patients with low-back pain. In the two-to-three-year period leading up to 2013, only two of the seven practices targeted for reduction showed any decrease at all in the US. (And the declines were tiny: The use of scans for those uncomplicated headaches decreased from 14.9 percent to 13.4 percent, for instance.)  Granted, you can\u2019t doctor by statistics alone. There\u2019s an art to it, and uncertainty is part of the profession. But doctors can\u2019t recommend the best therapies for their patients if hard evidence is missing on the comparative effectiveness of different treatments. The knowledge gap is especially large for medical procedures, as opposed to drugs, since there is no FDA for surgery. Doctors learn about new procedures from colleagues, specialty society meetings, and information provided by medical device companies \u2014 a potentially arbitrary and unscientific process. The political challenges of promoting evidence-based medicine One root of the problem is that the coalition in favor of evidence-based medicine is weak. It includes too few doctors, commands too little attention and energy from elected officials and advocates, and it\u2019s shot through with partisanship. Naturally, pharmaceutical companies and medical device makers wish to protect their profits, regardless of the comparative effectiveness vis a vis other treatments (or cost effectiveness) of what they are selling. While virtually all doctors support evidence-based medicine in the abstract, clinicians and medical societies seek to maintain their professional and clinical autonomy. Physicians are sensitive to being second-guessed, even when their beliefs about how well treatments work are based on their own experiences and intuitions, not rigorous studies. Politicians, who recognize that the public holds them in much lower regard than physicians, are hesitant to challenge the belief of many Americans that \u201cdoctor always knows best.\u201d The American faith in markets leads to a cultural discomfort with government-imposed limits on the supply or consumption of medical technology. Meanwhile, other advanced democracies use such limits (along with price controls) as part of the toolkit to control medical spending and promote \u201cvalue for money.\u201d  Every health care system has to wrestle with tradeoffs among access, innovation, cost control, quality and the efficiency of resource allocation. Other countries, including the UK, may require a favorable cost effectiveness ratio before a treatment is placed on the national formulary \u2014 meaning that some treatments, such as some cancer drugs, won\u2019t be recommended for routine funding if they are too expensive relative to their clinical benefits.  Many Americans would bridle at that kind of explicit rationing. Despite concerns about the rising cost of health care, for instance, Medicare routinely covers treatments that produce small benefits at significant social cost. In contrast to the British approach, Medicare generally covers treatments deemed \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d \u2014 a definition that doesn\u2019t include analysis of comparative effectiveness or cost in relation to other treatments. And what Medicare does influences the behavior of private insurers. (Commercial health plans cover a lot of that low-value CAT scanning.) On the positive side, the US approach promotes access to new medical products, yet it doesn\u2019t protect patients against the harms from receiving useless or low-value treatments. And it leaves less money to fund expensive therapies that have proven their worth. The specter of \u201cdeath panels\u201d hovers over the debate In the US, even modest reforms to use taxpayer money to fund research to learn what treatments work best, for which patients, have engendered controversy. Republicans famously charged that the establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) through the Affordable Care Act, would lead to the creation of \u201cdeath panels.\u201d The politicians made that argument even though the agency only funds studies and was given no authority to make policy decisions or payment recommendations. PCORI has yet to have a significant impact on clinical practice. It faces a sunset date of 2019, and its future remains unclear. It won\u2019t be easy to get out of the political rut we are in, but there are ways to build public support for sensible solutions.  For our book on the subject, my co-authors Alan Gerber, Conor Dowling, and I conducted a series of public option surveys, and found that people would like more information about the benefits and risks of treatment options. But they\u2019re indeed anxious that payers will use research findings to ration care or tie doctors\u2019 hands.  Yet, on the hopeful side, the public has great confidence in the recommendations of doctors, not only about individual medical problems but also broader health policy matters. We found through survey experiments that if doctors were to become forceful advocates for evidence-based medicine, many of the public\u2019s concerns would be allayed. (Our research also shows that other actors \u2014 drug companies, politicians and even patient advocacy groups \u2014 hold much less influence on public opinion.)  The deep reservoir of trust in physicians gives doctors both the civic responsibility and the political opportunity to spearhead efforts to address the problems of both over- and under-use of treatments. There is a small but growing movement among doctors to promote evidence-based practices \u2014 but they must battle some of the professional habits and biases I\u2019ve outlined. To build public support for needed changes, it is critical to distinguish the evidence-based medicine project \u2014 which is fundamentally about better science in medicine \u2014 from rationing and denial of beneficial services. There\u2019s no logical reason to think evidence-based treatments will always be less expensive than low-value treatments. An important Rand study has shown that Americans fail to receive recommended treatments nearly half the time, for conditions ranging from diabetes to pneumonia.  One way to shift public perceptions of the evidence-based campaign would be for researchers, clinicians, and federal agencies to support and publicize research on the relative benefits (and risks) of treatments that some experts believe are being underused, at least in some patient groups. These could include not only low-cost treatments, such as statins and eye exams for people with diabetes, but also expensive, high-value treatments, like new drugs for hepatitis C (Sovaldi, Harvoni). We know from experience how hard it is to limit the use of a treatment once it becomes ingrained. Treatments develop constituencies. This argues for insisting on strong evidence before new treatments are approved. However, there are costs to this approach: If approval procedures become too stringent, they could chill the development of breakthrough therapies as well as generate a political backlash. A proposal from the Hamilton Project would give the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) more resources to scrutinize medical technologies and allow the agency to experiment with \u201creference pricing\u201d: Medicare would pay a single price for all treatments, for a given condition, that have similar therapeutic effects, up to a cost-effectiveness threshold. Patients who want to receive less cost-effective treatments could still get them, but they\u2019d have to pay any difference out of pocket. That strikes the right balance. Finally, evidence-based medicine won\u2019t gain broad public acceptance so long as it remains a partisan issue. Much Republican rhetoric on this issue has been reckless. But one of the earliest advocates for a medical evidence research agency was Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare under George H. W. Bush.  Eventually, the war over Obamacare will end. When it does, there may be an opening to have a sensible conversation about ensuring that patients receive treatments grounded in sound science.  Eric M.

A new study finds that benefits from trade to the American economy may not always justify its costs in lost jobs. Credit Lang Lang/Reuters", "Were the experts wrong about the benefits of trade for the American economy? The nation\u2019s working class had another opportunity to demonstrate its political clout Tuesday, as primary voters went to the polls in Illinois and Ohio, Rust Belt states that have suffered intensely from the loss of good manufacturing jobs. Last week, the insurrection handed Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary to Bernie Sanders while continuing to buoy the insurgent Republican candidacy of Donald Trump. Voters\u2019 anger and frustration, driven in part by relentless globalization and technological change, may not propel either candidate to the presidency. But it is already having a big impact on America\u2019s future, shaking a once-solid consensus that freer trade is, necessarily, a good thing. \u201cThe economic populism of the presidential campaign has forced the recognition that expanded trade is a double-edged sword,\u201d wrote Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. What seems most striking is that the angry working class \u2014 dismissed so often as myopic, unable to understand the economic trade-offs presented by trade \u2014 appears to have understood what the experts are only belatedly finding to be true: The benefits from trade to the American economy may not always justify its costs. In a recent study, three economists \u2014 David Autor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Dorn at the University of Zurich and Gordon Hanson at the University of California, San Diego \u2014 raised a profound challenge to all of us brought up to believe that economies quickly recover from trade shocks. In theory, a developed industrial country like the United States adjusts to import competition by moving workers into more advanced industries that can successfully compete in global markets. They examined the experience of American workers after China erupted onto world markets some two decades ago. The presumed adjustment, they concluded, never happened. Or at least hasn\u2019t happened yet. Wages remain low and unemployment high in the most affected local job markets. Nationally, there is no sign of offsetting job gains elsewhere in the economy. What\u2019s more, they found that sagging wages in local labor markets exposed to Chinese competition reduced earnings by $213 per adult per year. In another study they wrote with Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price from M.I.T., they estimated that rising Chinese imports from 1999 to 2011 cost up to 2.4 million American jobs. \u201cThese results should cause us to rethink the short- and medium-run gains from trade,\u201d they argued. \u201cHaving failed to anticipate how significant the dislocations from trade might be, it is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate the gains from trade, such that the case for free trade is not based on the sway of theory alone, but on a foundation of evidence that illuminates who gains, who loses, by how much, and under what conditions.\u201d Global trade offers undeniable benefits. It helped pull hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty in a matter of a few decades, an unparalleled feat. It ensured Apple could benefit from China\u2019s ample supply of cheap labor. Consumers around the world gained better-priced, better-made goods. Still, though trade may be good for the country over all \u2014 after netting out winners and losers \u2014 the case for globalization based on the fact that it helps expand the economic pie by 3 percent becomes much weaker when it also changes the distribution of the slices by 50 percent, Mr. Autor argued. And that is especially true when the American political system has shown no interest in compensating those on the losing side. The impact of China\u2019s great leap into the market economy \u2014 which drew hundreds of millions of impoverished peasants into the manufacturing sector, mostly making goods for export to the United States and other wealthy nations \u2014 is waning. China\u2019s wages are rising fast. Its exports and economy are slowing.", "Trade Shock Manufacturing employment in the Rust Belt and elsewhere in the United States has been decimated by the rise of China as an industrial power and export-driven economy.", "Trade with other parts of the world has not been as disruptive. For all the criticism of Nafta, most economists assess  its impact on American workers as modest. Trade flows with Mexico were smaller and more balanced than those with China. American manufacturing employment remained fairly stable in the years after Nafta came into force in 1994, plummeting only after China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 and gained consistent access to markets in the United States. The Chinese export onslaught, however, left a scar on the American working class that has not healed. That disproportionate impact suggests Washington officialdom might do well to reassess its approach to future trade liberalization. Most important, it points to reconsidering how policy makers deal with trade\u2019s distributional consequences. It doesn\u2019t mean walling off the United States from the rest of the world, but it does mean learning from the experience of other advanced nations that had a much healthier response to China\u2019s rise. Germany, for example, not only received a surge of Chinese imports, but also experienced an onslaught of imports from Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet bloc. But it managed to maintain a more balanced trade because German manufacturers increased their exports to all these countries too, offsetting the job losses from import competition. Mr. Autor suggests that Americans\u2019 low savings rate was a big part of the story, coupled with foreigners\u2019 appetite for accumulating dollar assets, which helped keep American interest rates low and the dollar strong, in that way fueling a persistent trade deficit. But other factors were at work. Robert Gordon of Northwestern University suggested to me that Germany\u2019s highly skilled workers were harder to replace with cheaper Chinese labor, limiting though not totally eliminating outsourcing. Germany\u2019s stronger labor unions also put up more of a fight. Washington played its part, too. In their new book \u201cConcrete Economics\u201d (Harvard Business Review Press), Stephen S. Cohen and J. Bradford DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley suggest that ultimately, it was the fault of American policy choices. The United States might have leaned against China\u2019s export-led strategy, they argue, perhaps by insisting more forcefully that Beijing let its currency rise as its trade surplus swelled. It might have tried to foster the cutting-edge industries of the future, as government had done so many times before, encouraging the shift from textiles to jumbo jets and from toys to semiconductors. What Washington did, instead, was hitch the nation\u2019s future to housing and finance. But Wall Street, instead of spreading prosperity, delivered the worst recession the world had seen since the 1930s. Even at best, they write, the transformation of banking and finance has \u201cproduced nothing (or exceedingly little) of value.\u201d So where should policy makers go from here? There are no easy answers. Tearing up existing trade agreements and retreating behind high tariff barriers \u2014 as Mr. Trump, and perhaps Mr. Sanders, would have it \u2014 would be immensely unproductive. It would throw a wrench into the works of a wobbly world economy. And reneging on international treaties would vastly complicate the international coordination needed to combat climate change. But in any future trade liberalization \u2014 including the Obama administration\u2019s pending Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, if it is to go forward at all \u2014 policy makers must be much more careful about managing the costs. Mr. Autor suggests any further deals to increase trade should be gradual, to give much more time for exposed companies and their workers to retool and shift into other jobs and sectors. Perhaps most important, the new evidence from trade suggests American policy makers cannot continue to impose all the pain on the nation\u2019s blue-collar workers if they are not going to provide a stronger safety net. That might have been justified if the distributional costs of trade were indeed small and short-lived. But now that we know they are big and persistent, it looks unconscionable.

Now, a new study--building on a smaller but growing body of research in the workplace--supports the power of forgiveness to potentially improve well-being and productivity in professional settings. Conflict among colleagues is inevitable, and--left unheeded--associated with significant stress, health problems (both mental and physical), and poor productivity. Researchers set out to explore the role of forgiveness in ameliorating these negative impacts. The participants--more than 200 employees working in office jobs in Washington, DC, or manufacturing jobs in the Midwest--responded to questionnaires about their levels of forgiveness, productivity, and well-being.", "The first survey asked respondents to focus on a specific offense, and how they believed it affected them. The second study looked at participants' general tendency to be forgiving and their general state of mind and work habits over the previous month. In both cases, forgiveness was linked to increased productivity, decreased absenteeism (fewer days missing work), and fewer mental and physical health problems, such as sadness and headaches. In the second study, these benefits were partly explained by reductions in interpersonal stress that went along with a forgiving disposition. This new research is important to employees and employers alike, as a lack of forgiveness negatively affects the individuals involved and organizations as a whole. Holding on to negative feelings after a conflict may lead to disengagement at work, a lack of collaboration, and aggressive behavior. Carrying a grudge is also associated with increased stress and a host of negative emotions, including anger, hostility, and vengeful rumination.  Since many people who have been in conflict need to continue to work together, forgiveness can be an effective coping tool, and a way to repair relationships and restore trust--both of which are key to effective work cultures. More evidence of the power of forgiveness In 2012, my team at Courageous Leadership LLC worked with employees at Google to build a more courageous culture, including the courage to forgive (one of the keys to healthy ongoing work relationships). We had employees share times when they failed to act on their values at work, to admit they didn't understand something, or to speak up when they thought they had a better idea. This was designed to remind everyone how easy it is to act outside of our values in stressful situations--to do something that might merit forgiveness. Participants then practiced taking courageous action. We had them use the REACH model (developed by Everett L. Worthington, one of the coauthors of the new workplace study) to practice forgiveness by identifying current grudges and work on forgiving (not condoning) the behavior. Participants also remembered and shared when others had forgiven them. Our program also showed positive impact. Participants reported a greater understanding of the power of stressful situations to negatively affect behavior. They also reported feeling better and more connected afterward; as one noted: \"I had a deepened sense of lightening inside, like letting go of heavy weights. I feel the forgiveness exercise for me was very powerful.\" Participants also took more social risks, like offering new ideas, admitting fears or concerns, and asking for or offering help. Research shows that this kind of forgiveness can even impact employees who aren't involved in the conflict. When people see others practicing forgiveness (and other virtuous behaviors) at work, it often fosters positive emotions that can improve decision-making, cognitive functioning, and the quality of relationships. How to foster forgiveness at work  Unresolved stress from interpersonal conflict often dampens our cognitive and compassionate capacities, making it hard to find a way to forgive. Drawing on the implications of their study, the researchers offer individuals and organizations some suggestions to foster forgiveness at work:  Model forgiveness at work, particularly if you're a leader. Leaders' behavior often has the greatest impact on organizational culture, a kind of contagion effect. Leaders who model forgiveness on a regular basis are cueing similar behavior in others. Apologize and attempt to make restitutions. If we don't take responsibility for our mistakes, distrust grows and the fear of something happening again can be worse than the original incident. Rebuild trust by working on a common task, creating new experiences and memories of cooperation. Conduct interventions (sometimes best done by third parties) to address conflict and foster forgiveness. Invest in programs to build understanding and teach evidence-based tools for ongoing forgiveness in the workplace. There's an old saying (attributed to everyone from the Buddha to Carrie Fisher) that goes, \"Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.\" If you're holding onto a grudge at work, you could be sharing the poison with your colleagues.  Forgiveness, of course, does not mean we condone or ignore bad behavior. Every workplace should have policies and procedures for dealing quickly with serious transgressions. However, if you do feel ready and the situation warrants it, give forgiveness a try. It could help you, your colleagues, and your workplace."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

The quality of the coaches who, after two weeks, appear to be in danger of not staying employed after this NFL season is nothing short of astonishing. New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin has won two Super Bowls. The New Orleans Saints\u2019 Sean Payton has won one. Jeff Fisher of the St. Louis Rams is in his 21st year as a head coach. Yet the most interesting of the group is Chip Kelly. Largely because that\u2019s what Chip Kelly has proven to be: Interesting. Effective? Not yet. Not consistently. So now the Eagles must consider how much longer to let the experiment run. Several teams reportedly wanted to hire Kelly, but the Eagles succeeded in making the bet that his innovative and fast-paced offensive scheme at Oregon could translate in the NFL. After two games of Kelly\u2019s third season \u2014 following an off-season during which he took control of personnel decisions and repeatedly made bold (and bewildering) moves \u2014 it appears they were wrong. The Eagles gained 226 yards in a 20-10 loss to the Cowboys Sunday, a chunk of which came late in the game when the Cowboys were sitting back in deep zones to stop long passes. (The game was so putrid in general it proved one outrageous thing: The Redskins can compete.)", "(Eric Hartline, USA TODAY Sports) DeMarco Murray, who Kelly signed after sending fan favorite LeSean McCoy to Buffalo in a trade (the player he got in return, linebacker Kiko Alonso, was coming off an ACL tear; he left Sunday\u2019s game with a knee injury), gained 2 yards on 13 carries. Murray has now run 21 times this year for 11 yards. He did have five catches for 53 yards Sunday, but so far he\u2019s not been nearly as dynamic as McCoy. Kelly failed to notice that Murray\u2019s success last year had mostly to do with running behind a great offensive line for a team able to stretch the field thanks to a top-flight wide receiver (that player, Dez Bryant, missed Sunday\u2019s game with injury; the Eagles let their best and fastest receiver, Jeremy Maclin, leave in free agency.)", "(Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports) Sam Bradford, brought in by Kelly to replace Nick Foles, was 23-for-37 passing with two interceptions. He failed to make throws despite usually have time to do so and looked generally bewildered. The interception he threw to end one Eagles\u2019 drive \u2014 on the heels of Tony Romo\u2019s injury \u2014 was the definition of a forced throw. There was no opening. On a later somewhat promising drive, he simply missed a wide open receiver. Kelly\u2019s rebuilt offensive line was feeble when run blocking. Evan Mathis \u2014 another player unceremoniously dispatched before the season \u2014 certainly would have helped.", "(Eric Hartline, USA TODAY Sports) Philadelphia\u2019s refreshed secondary struggled and allowed Brandon Weeden \u2014 who didn\u2019t even bother to warm up after Romo was hurt \u2014 to complete 7-of-7 passes. Brandon Boykin, who dared to want more playing time (as if that\u2019s unique for a reserve, or in any way a negative thing), was off playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Eagles\u2019 defense actually was pretty good. But there\u2019s not a defensive unit in the league that will succeed if it is on the field 40 minutes, allowed to rest only during 3-and-outs run at 2-minute-drill pace in the first half. Though the Eagles have lost five of their last six games under Kelly, his career record is 20-14 and you could easily argue he deserves more time to bring this team together. It did, afterall, undergo all of those drastic changes. And, unlike college football, you don\u2019t have to be nearly perfect during the season to even have a chance to play for the national title. There\u2019s time for the Eagles to turn it around. But Kelly does not seem to have adjusted to the fact that he\u2019s coaching wealthy, free-thinking pro athletes who are facing pro athletes of the same caliber. At Oregon he could be a dictator and get away with it. NCAA football players have basically no rights; they could try to leave, and Kelly could block them from transferring. He had complete power over them. He also had a huge budget, thanks to Nike founder Phil Knight, and could recruit players who were usually better than the opponents\u2019 players. With 85 of them on scholarship and dozens of other playing as walk ons, he could run his intense system through intense practices and always have enough healthy and talented players to make it through.", "(Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports) That hasn\u2019t worked in the NFL. As much as he wants it to, Kelly\u2019s system doesn\u2019t erase talent deficiencies, and he keeps making his team worse by getting rid of guys who dare to question him or hold a different thought. His offensive scheme, it has turned out, is a fairly typical set of plays that, when run quickly against a flagging defense, sort of works. When offensive players who are as likely as the defense to tire \u2014 because there are fewer substitution options with a smaller squad \u2014 rush through those plays, the scheme looks sloppy and unsophisticated. Or sort of like a lot of next-big-thing offenses brought to the NFL by college coaches. Kelly\u2019s aloof genius routine played well in a college town. Philadelphia fans even bought it for a while, owing partly to his early success but more so to their deep desire to get to a Super Bowl. Underneath all of that vitriol is a lot of sunny happy faith that the Eagles will find their way. Doing so under a guy who refuses to explain himself and believes he always knows best works just fine for Eagles fans. Unless, of course, he proves incapable of adjusting to the rest of the league adjusting to him. Which is why they booed him off the field Sunday. They know you don\u2019t win a Super Bowl by having the best plan (or team) during the preseason. You win a Super Bowl by reworking the plan repeatedly, so that even when it is old it seems news. That\u2019s what makes you a genius at the NFL level. If Kelly can\u2019t re-ignite his offense in the next four (seemingly winnable) games \u2014 at the Jets and Redskins, home against the Saints and Giants \u2014 those fans will also know this: it is time to move on."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times", "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s selection of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education has sent shock waves through the educational establishment. Understandably so, since this is a clear sign that Mr. Trump intends a major national push to direct public funds to private and charter schools. But this is more than just a political or financial loss for traditional public schools. It will also most likely be a loss for students. The choice of Ms. DeVos might not seem surprising. Mr. Trump has, after all, proposed $20 billion to finance \u201cschool choice\u201d initiatives and Ms. DeVos supports these ideas. Yet of all the candidates the transition team was apparently considering, Ms. DeVos has easily the worst record. As one of the architects of Detroit\u2019s charter school system, she is partly responsible for what even charter advocates acknowledge is the biggest school reform disaster in the country. At least some of the other candidates for education secretary, like Michelle Rhee, the former District of Columbia schools chancellor, led reforms that were accompanied by improved student results. Consider this: Detroit is one of many cities in the country that participates in an objective and rigorous test of student academic skills, called the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The other cities participating in the urban version of this test, including Baltimore, Cleveland and Memphis, are widely considered to be among the lowest-performing school districts in the country. Detroit is not only the lowest in this group of lowest-performing districts on the math and reading scores, it is the lowest by far. One well-regarded study found that Detroit\u2019s charter schools performed at about the same dismal level as its traditional public schools. The situation is so bad that national philanthropists interested in school reform refuse to work in Detroit. As someone who has studied the city\u2019s schools and used to work there, I am saddened by all this. In contrast, consider the case of New Orleans, where virtually all the schools are charters. Here, the state has taken over about a third of charter schools because of poor results since the system was revamped in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Also, while the system initially had limited oversight and worked poorly, local leaders now take extensive steps to facilitate a fair process of school choice, help prevent schools from cherry-picking students and manage a centralized student expulsion system. In other words, the system provides some oversight to help ensure that families have good schools to choose from. The New Orleans results have been impressive. In the decade after the reforms, the city\u2019s standardized test scores have increased by  eight to 15 percentile points and moved the district from the bottom to almost the state average on many measures. High school graduation and college entry rates also seem to have improved significantly, even while suspensions, expulsions and the rate of students switching schools have all dropped. Detroit and New Orleans represent radically different versions of school choice \u2014 and the one that seems to work is the one that uses the state oversight that Ms. DeVos opposes. New Orleans is also important because it is the only city in the country where we can compare the results for charter schools with the approach Ms. DeVos prefers even more \u2014 school vouchers. In a study my center released this year, researchers found that the statewide Louisiana voucher program had exactly the opposite result as the New Orleans charter reforms. Students who participated in the voucher program had declines in achievement tests scores of eight to 16 percentile points. Since many of these students received vouchers through a lottery, these results are especially telling. Louisiana is one of two states where statewide voucher programs have been studied. In Ohio, the results were also negative (though less so). These statewide programs provide the best point of comparison for any national program that the new administration might propose. This evidence should create a real problem for Ms. DeVos in her confirmation hearings. Fortunately, even if she is confirmed, the low level of federal funding devoted to education will limit the new administration\u2019s ability to pursue these policies. Also, any real expansion of unregulated vouchers will require action both by state governments and by Congress. But you don\u2019t have to be in the educational establishment to be worried about where this is going. The DeVos nomination is a triumph of ideology over evidence that should worry anyone who wants to improve results for children. Douglas N. Harris, a professor of economics at Tulane University, is the founding director of the Education Research Alliance for New Orleans and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

But trust has been declining for decades, and the most tangible and immediate damage may be to public health and safety. Mistrust in the medical profession \u2014 particularly during emergencies like epidemics \u2014 can have deadly consequences. In 1966, more than three-fourths of Americans had great confidence in medical leaders; today, only 34 percent do. Compared with people in other developed countries, Americans are considerably less likely to trust doctors, and only a quarter express confidence in the health system. During some recent disease outbreaks, less than one-third of Americans said they trusted public health officials to share complete and accurate information. Only 14 percent trust the federal government to do what\u2019s right most of the time. Less Likely to Engage in Healthful Behaviors Trust is the cornerstone of the doctor-patient relationship, and patients who trust their doctors are more likely to follow treatment plans. One study found that nearly two-thirds of patients with high levels of trust always take their medications, but only 14 percent of those with low levels of trust do. Another study found that trust is one of the best predictors of whether patients follow a doctor\u2019s advice about things like exercise, smoking cessation and condom use. Mistrust can lead people to skip the flu shot or forgo the measles vaccine for their children \u2014 with potentially serious consequences for individual patients and the broader population. Trust is also critical for patient satisfaction, and makes it more likely that patients keep seeing the same doctor \u2014 which can have other positive effects, like fewer emergency department visits. There are large disparities in trust along socioeconomic and racial lines (often for good reason), and building trust among vulnerable and marginalized patients may be particularly important. For patients with H.I.V., for instance, trust in medical providers is associated with a higher likelihood of taking antiretroviral drugs, better reported mental and physical health, more clinic visits, and fewer emergency department visits. States with higher levels of social trust tend to have lower rates of late H.I.V. diagnoses \u2014 after the disease has progressed \u2014 partly because people feel more comfortable seeking care and getting tested. Stifling Innovation Low levels of trust can hurt innovation. We think of medical innovation as being driven by doctors, scientists and entrepreneurs, but patients play an important role, too. They must be willing to try new treatments and technologies for them to spread, but are unlikely to do so if they don\u2019t trust in the therapy\u2019s effectiveness or the prescriber\u2019s motives. One study found that for cancer patients considering experimental chemotherapy, trust in their physician was one of the most important reasons they enrolled in a clinical trial \u2014 on par with the belief that the treatment would be effective. Today, in the era of wearable devices and electronic health records, trust that personal data will be kept secure and private \u2014 and that such technologies are useful \u2014 remains a barrier to greater acceptance and use. Despite millions of dollars being poured into telemedicine, Americans are still much less likely to trust diagnoses made remotely than those made in person. Responding to Epidemics Perhaps most concerning is evidence that low levels of trust can weaken the ability of governments and public health agencies to respond to epidemics. A recent study suggests that Ebola spread more widely and persisted longer than it otherwise would have if there were higher levels of institutional trust. Researchers surveyed people in Liberia about their knowledge of Ebola, about how much they trusted the government, and how likely they were to take recommended precautions against Ebola. These precautions included adopting safe burial practices; abiding by restrictions on travel, social gatherings and curfews; keeping a bucket of chlorinated water at home; and avoiding physical contact with those displaying symptoms. People who didn\u2019t trust the government were much less likely to take recommended precautions. They weren\u2019t less well informed about Ebola, nor did they hold more erroneous beliefs. They just trusted less. Can Trust Be Rebuilt? Trust, of course, requires trustworthiness. Waning trust in the health system is partly a result of the sometimes well-founded public perception that its key players pursue profits at the expense of patients. (The United States is the only wealthy advanced nation that has not committed to universal health care.) But there are steps medical leaders and public health officials can take to show they deserve to be trusted. People\u2019s trust depends fundamentally on three questions: Do you know what you\u2019re doing? Will you tell me what you\u2019re doing? Are you doing it to help me or help yourself? Clear, transparent communication and a history of fulfilled trust are important, and health care providers can also build trust by disclosing conflicts of interest; creating expectations for long-term relationships; and promoting shared interests and smaller power differences with patients. Giving patients easier access to their medical notes, for instance, may help them feel more in control of their care and increase trust in their providers \u2014 especially for vulnerable populations. Many patients have also traditionally been wary of the motives and methods of medical research. Partnering with patients and communities to give them greater say in the goals, design and dissemination of research can help ease a sense that research is being conducted \u201con them\u201d instead of \u201cwith them.\u201d More engagement between individual patients and physicians through collaborative endeavors may have the added benefit of capitalizing on a paradox of Americans\u2019 trust: We\u2019re highly trusting of our own doctors and generally satisfied with our own care, but we distrust medical leaders and the health system as a whole. Governments should also consider using trusted spokesmen and spokeswomen during crises. In a disease outbreak caused by bioterrorism, for example, Americans are more likely to trust information coming from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention than the Department of Health and Human Services or the F.B.I. Demonstrably false statements from high-level government officials can have lasting consequences for Americans\u2019 trust in institutions. All institutions are imperfect, and some are plainly corrupt. A degree of skepticism is inevitable and important. But when doubt becomes pervasive, it can erode the glue that binds society together, and the medicine that keeps us healthy.

Intel is also a major player in this space, having worked on the first cellular-supported PC back in 2005 (with Sony). It's been heavily involved in battery improvements over the past few years. But if you believe the hype, what we\u2019ll see debut in 2018 will be nothing like we\u2019ve witnessed in the past. \u201cWith computers we have today, you\u2019re lucky if you can get 15 hours of battery performance \u2014 and in most cases, it\u2019s 8 to 10 hours, if that \u2013 so where I see the breakthrough here is a new benchmark of 22 hours, and standby of at least a week,\u201d says technology analyst Tim Bajarin, who also serves as president at Creative Strategies, one of the first market research firms in Silicon Valley. In fact, with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, ASUS is claiming battery life of up to 22 hours of continuous video playback, and up to 30 days on standby.", "At $799, the ASUS NovaGo (model # TP370) will also be the first always-connected PC with a 360-degree flip hinge \u2013 making it a \u201c2-in-1\u201d that can convert from laptop mode to a tablet by bending back the 13.3-inch screen \u2013 and the first with Gigabit LTE speeds, for an always on, always connected experience.  \u201cI\u2019ve been using these devices for many months, and the one thing that often gets overlooked is the \u2018always on\u2019 feature,\u201d adds Miguel Nunes, senior director of product management at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. \u201cLike your smartphone, even when the screen is off, it\u2019s still connected, so when I open the lid, it does facial recognition, and I\u2019m in.\u201d Speed boon, too", "Along with multi-day battery performance, these always-on PC's take advantage of ubiquitous cellular connectivity. \u201cWith the NovaGo, you don\u2019t have to find a Wi-Fi hotspot, and you get fast 1 gigabit-per-second wireless Internet speeds that are between 3 to 7 times faster than the average broadband speed,\u201d says Randall Grilli, director of media relations at ASUS North America. \u201cIt allows you to download a 2-hour movie in about 10 seconds.\u201d ASUS is supporting both a nano SIM and built-in eSIM, the latter of which allows you to easily switch networks in areas that support it, says Grilli. Cellular connectivity is optional with always-connected PCs, since the user must pay for data. Details are still scarce on provider pricing plans \u2014 ASUS says users may work directly with Microsoft on data plan activation or directly with a provider, for instance \u2014 but SIM-supported laptops haven\u2019t been adopted by the mainstream in the past, reminds Bajarin. \u201cConsumers are often reluctant to pay extra money for an additional data SIM, so until we see people actually putting down dollars for connectivity, I\u2019m not sure if that will drive ACPCs,\u201d says Bajarin. \u201cWhat will drive this is 22 hours of battery. Ultimately, the consumer wants all-day computing, even though always-connected would be a good feature, too.\u201d Tradeoffs? Perhaps", "These always-on PCs sound amazing, no doubt, between long battery life, always-on architecture, and LTE connectivity. So, what\u2019s the catch, you ask? Though it\u2019s too early to know for sure, power and compatibility might not be what you\u2019re used to with previous Windows laptops. Intel has been trying to make PC's more mobile for six or seven years, with ultrabooks, then with 3G and LTE connectivity options \u2014 say with the LTE-supported Samsung Galaxy Book 12, with Verizon. \u201cFirst and foremost, it must be a great PC. It has to deliver performance\u2026and PC experiences\u2026that consumer expect,\u201d said Josh Newman, general manager of mobile innovation segment for Intel. Newman says when consumers take the new PC out of the box \u201cit should just work with all the software they\u2019re used to working \u2013 and work better than the 4- or 5-year-old PC they may be replacing \u2013 and same goes for multitasking, and peripherals, too.\u201d Even Qualcomm concedes it\u2019s not going after those that demand serious horsepower. \u201cFor full disclosure, we are not a high-end gaming PC. That\u2019s not Qualcomm,\u201d says Nunes. \u201cOur strength is in mobility, thin and light devices, and with Microsoft, we focused heavily focused on what people are doing with their devices.\u201d While ASUS and HP have confirmed support for Qualcomm\u2019s ACPCs, and other major players will likely unveil their wares early next week at the annual tech trade show CES in Las Vegas, not everyone is onboard. \u201cDell is not planning to announce any PCs with Qualcomm Snapdragon processors in the foreseeable future,\u201d said Jay Parker, president of the client product group at Dell, in a statement provided to USA TODAY. \u201cWe have a strong portfolio of PCs for consumer and commercial customers that deliver excellent battery life with LTE connectivity \u2013 which constitutes \u2018always on\u2019 in the customer\u2019s mind,\u201d says Parker. \u201cWe find that our customers don\u2019t want to sacrifice full functionality and performance \u2013 that\u2019s what our products deliver. The current Snapdragon processor doesn\u2019t allow us to strike that right balance today.\u201d", "Casio's G's Eye is a wearable action on display at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@FantasticMrNate) has the story. Buzz60", "NEW YORK \u2013 Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury is well on its way to becoming one of the fastest selling nonfiction books in recent years. Fire and Fury has sold more than 1.7 million copies in the combined formats of hardcover, e-books and audio, publisher Henry Holt & Co. told The Associated Press on Wednesday. It's spending its third consecutive week at No. 1 on USA TODAY's best-selling book list and remains No. 1 on Amazon.com and other lists. NPD BookScan, which tracks around 85 percent of sales for physical books, told the AP on Wednesday that its numbers for Fire and Fury rose for the third straight week. Fire and Fury sold more than 300,000 copies last week, according to BookScan, and more than 500,000 copies overall as retailers are finally catching up with demand. NPD BookScan does not register a sale until the book has actually been sent to the customer. John Sargent, CEO of Holt\u2019s parent company MacMillan, has said that e-books sales for Fire and Fury exceed 250,000 copies and more than 100,000 have been sold in audio. Nonfiction books rarely sell 1 million copies so quickly, with examples over the years including Bill Clinton\u2019s My Life and Sarah Palin\u2019s Going Rogue, both of which were million sellers after two weeks of publication. The standard for fiction, unlikely to be matched anytime soon, is the final Harry Potter book. Released in 2007, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows sold more than 8 million copies in its first 24 hours. Holt president and publisher Stephen Rubin told the AP recently that he first learned about a possible Trump book when he and Wolff dined late in 2016. It was soon after Trump\u2019s surprise election, and Wolff mentioned that he had a \u201creally good chance\u201d to get White House access for the new administration. Rubin, who had released Wolff\u2019s 2008 biography of Rupert Murdoch, The Man Who Owns the News, said he quickly worked out a deal to publish the Trump book. In announcing Fire and Fury last November, Holt promised a \u201cwhite-hot light on a president who made it possible for his family to take over \u2018the people\u2019s house,\u2019 even as other members of Trump\u2019s inner circle tried to govern while serving their unpredictable and often vituperative boss.\u201d Rubin has said he was hoping Trump would tweet about Fire and Fury, and sales exploded after Trump not only tweeted but also threatened to sue. An initial print run of 150,000 proved not nearly enough, and only over the past week did Amazon have hardcovers immediately on hand. \u201cA 150,000 first printing, in today\u2019s world, speaks to being widely confident in what we had,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cDid we know it would turn out like this? Of course not. No one would know that.

For Art Tanderup, a Nebraska farmer who spent the last five years crusading to keep TransCanada from building the conduit over his modest 160 acres, the spill confirmed his worst fears.  He was even more distraught when President Donald Trump reversed course and announced he would approve Keystone XL pipeline days after taking office in January. Now, Tanderup\u2019s concerns seem even more warranted, after the existing Keystone pipeline spilled again on Thursday, this time leaking 210,000 gallons \u2015 12 times more toxic tar sands oil than before \u2015 on a grassy field in the remote northeastern corner of the Mount Rushmore State. It is the largest spill in Keystone\u2019s history. \u201cWe\u2019re religious people,\u201d Tanderup, 65, told HuffPost by phone on Friday. \u201cIt makes you think maybe the creator is sending us a strong message.\u201d  Keystone XL was the subject of seven-year fight between environmentalists and the Obama administration before Trump reversed course. Native activists in the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation \u2015 roughly 200 miles from the latest spill site in Amherst, South Dakota \u2015 waged a monthslong battle to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline, which Trump pushed ahead earlier this year. Environmentalists, tribes, concerned ranchers and scientists have been saying for years that the potential for catastrophic spills \u2015 and the impacts they would have on land and water \u2015 far outweigh the perceived benefits of new pipelines.  Pipelines reduce the cost of shipping crude by train \u2015 an expense an industry struggling with low oil prices has been eager to eliminate. Trump vowed to jumpstart the United States economy by promoting fossil fuels, slashing environmental regulations and making it easier for drilling and pipeline projects to begin. He signed an executive action in January making Keystone XL and the Dakota Access pipeline top priorities. The State Department approved Keystone XL in March, the same month the Army approved completion of Dakota Access without an environmental study. Thousands of demonstrators, including members of dozens of indigenous tribes, descended on the nation\u2019s capital in protest, demanding that the Trump administration respect native sovereignty.", "Art and Helen Tanderup at their farm in Neligh, Nebraska. The farm has been in Helen Tanderup's family for more than 100 years.", "Construction on the Dakota Access pipeline finished a month later. In August, the Nebraska Public Service Commission began contentious hearings to assess whether Keystone XL would benefit the state. The regulators are scheduled to vote Monday on whether to approve the pipeline, but are barred under state law from considering the South Dakota spill in their decision. The proposed 1,179-mile pipeline would, as the name implies, extend a shortcut for Canadian tar sands pumped through the existing Keystone Pipeline to refineries in Texas. It would carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day, producing emissions equivalent to putting 5.6 million new cars on the road, according to estimates from the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth. Oil from tar sands \u2015 a noxious mix of sand, clay and bitumen, a thick, viscous oil \u2015 is considered one of the dirtiest fossil fuels. The proposed route through Nebraska traverses the Sandhills, a region of ancient prairies and sand dunes. It would also cut through the Ogallala, the largest aquifer in North America, at times going underwater. The rock formation, spongey with gravel, silt, sand, and clay, formed 10 million years ago and replenishes very slowly from surface rivers and streams. The water level is particularly close to the surface in Nebraska, making it especially vulnerable in a spill.  In a 2011 analysis, University of Nebraska professor Dr. John Stansbury concluded that TransCanada \u201cmade significant flawed and inappropriate assumptions about the frequency and severity of expected spills from its pipelines.\u201d While the company estimated Keystone XL would have 11 spills of 50 barrels or more over a 50-year period, Stansbury pegged the figure at 91. He also estimated there would be approximately two major spills per year, some potentially releasing as much as 180,000 barrels. For its vote Monday, the Public Service Commission cannot \u201cevaluate safety considerations, including the risk or impact of spills or leaks from the major oil pipeline,\u201d according to rules laid out in Nebraska\u2019s Major Oil Pipeline Siting Act of 2011. However, the law allows the commission to consider \u201ceconomic and social impacts,\u201d compliance with state and local regulations, and evidence that the pipeline would damage or deplete natural resources. Deb Collins, a spokeswoman for the Public Service Commission, declined to comment on how the Keystone spill would factor into Monday\u2019s decision, and referred HuffPost to the statute.", "Keystone XL would carry tar sands oil from Canada through Montana and South Dakota to Nebraska, where the conduit would link up to the Keystone Pipeline, which was completed in 2010. The highly pollutive oil would then go to refineries in Texas.", "\u201cThe Public Service Commission rules say they cannot factor in safety,\u201d Tanderup said. \u201cBut, good heavens, I don\u2019t know how you could be a sane person and not say, \u2019Wow, this could happen in our Sandhills, our Ogallala aquifer, and look at the disaster we\u2019d have.\u201d The latest spill is \u201can awful incident, and it reinforces everything that we\u2019ve been saying all along,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, president of Bold Nebraska, a progressive group fighting against Keystone XL. \u201cThere\u2019s literally no public interest that this pipeline would bring.\u201d David Domina, the lawyer representing the 90 Nebraska landowners opposed to the pipeline, said it\u2019s the commission\u2019s duty to ignore the spill in South Dakota. But he\u2019s confident the commissioners will reject TransCanada\u2019s request.  During the trial over the past year, TransCanada failed to defend their two main arguments for how Keystone XL would benefit Nebraska, he said. The company initially promised a jobs boom, but offered no rebuttal when an economist using the firm\u2019s own data calculated that the project would yield only nine permanent positions and less than one-fifth of the temporary construction gigs initially outlined. TransCanada pitched the pipeline as a steady stream of tax revenue, but limited its forecasts to 15 years. By the 16th year, the tax gains for the state would drop off to zero. Because the company planned to operate the pipeline for 50 years, that means the conduit would be a drain on state resources for 35 years. Domina said that would cost at least $14 million, not counting indirect expenses such as if the company ever called on state police, used highways or required a truck to be weighed. The company also failed to justify the proposed route for the pipeline, Domina said. The firm insisted it could not alter the route through Nebraska due to legal restrictions in South Dakota, where the Keystone pipeline is located. But during cross examination, a company engineer admitted TransCanada based that argument on a narrow work permit technicality.  \u201cThe trial proceedings were not beneficial or favorable to TransCanada,\u201d Domina told HuffPost by phone. \u201cThey were a disaster for TransCanada and a success for the landowners.\u201d TransCanada did not return emails requesting comment Friday. Bu in a statement posted to its website, the company said, \u201cThe safety of the public and environment are our top priorities and we will continue to provide updates as they become available.\u201d For Allison Reville, a political activist and member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate Sioux Tribe, the incident this week is exactly what she and other pipeline opponents have been warning about and knew would happen. Wahpeton\u2019s reservation is located approximately 30 miles east of the site of the spill. \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d she said, adding that she fears the spill could leave the aquifer system and local drinking water contaminated.  While the cleanup effort will be important, Renville said she hopes the incident will discourage officials from approving Keystone XL and serve as a wake-up call for the residents of red South Dakota, in particular the farming community.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking, myself specifically, for the last year \u2014 \u2019Where is South Dakota? Where are our famers? Why isn\u2019t anybody sticking up for us? Where is everybody else downriver?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asking people to stand in solidarity with us and to help us protect the water, to help us protect the land. Just as much as we hold all of our resources sacred, there\u2019s a farming community who rely on everything too.\u201d  \u201cWe need people to wake up and realize that this isn\u2019t just a threat to Native American life,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is a threat to everything that we know.\u201d"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Prompt", "size": 3}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["You are an expert academic classifier.

Two research groups found that the record rainfall as Harvey stalled over Texas in late August, which totaled more than 50 inches in some areas, was as much as 38 percent higher than would be expected in a world that was not warming. While many scientists had said at the time that Harvey was probably affected by climate change, because warmer air holds more moisture, the size of the increase surprised some. \u201cThe amount of precipitation increase is worse than I expected,\u201d said Michael J. Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an author of a paper on his group\u2019s findings, which included the 38 percent figure. Based on how much the world has warmed, Dr. Wehner said, before the analysis he had expected an increase of only about 6 or 7 percent. The other study, by an international coalition of scientists known as World Weather Attribution, found that Harvey\u2019s rainfall was 15 percent higher than would be expected without climate change. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the lead author of the second study, said that climate change also made such an extreme rainstorm much more likely. \u201cThe probability of such an event has increased by roughly a factor of three,\u201d he said. While the likelihood of a Harvey-like storm was perhaps once in every 3,000 years in the past, he said, now it\u2019s once every 1,000 years or so \u2014 which means that in any given year, there is 0.1 percent chance of a similar storm occurring along the Gulf Coast.", "Hurricane Harvey on August 25. Credit NASA/Reuters", "Harvey developed in the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall near Corpus Christi, Tex., as a strong Category 4 hurricane. By the time it reached Houston it had weakened to a tropical storm, but it moved slowly over the region, rotating and picking up more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Thousands of homes and businesses in the region were flooded and more than 80 people died. David W. Titley, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved with either study, said the research showed that \u201cwhile a storm of Harvey\u2019s strength is still rare, it\u2019s not as rare as it once was. \u201cCommunities all along the Gulf Coast need to adapt to a world where the heaviest rains are more than we have ever seen,\u201d he added. Antonia Sebastian, a researcher at Rice University and a co-author of the World Weather Attribution paper, said that Harvey was a much larger event than governments and developers normally plan and build for. \u201cWhat we see from this study is that the flood hazard zone isn\u2019t stationary,\u201d Dr. Sebastian said. \u201cPrecipitation is changing, and that\u2019s changing the boundaries. That should be considered.\u201d In August, a week before Hurricane Harvey, President Trump rolled back an Obama-era executive order that included climate change and sea-level rise in federal flood risk standards. Both studies were released during the annual meeting here of the American Geophysical Union, a large gathering of leading climate researchers and other earth scientists. The studies only looked at the impact of climate change on rainfall, not whether warming affected Harvey\u2019s formation or strength. Those issues remain a subject of much debate among scientists, with some researchers suggesting that strong hurricanes \u2014 category 4 and above \u2014 will become more frequent as the world continues to warm.", "Evacuating homes in Houston during the flooding from Hurricane Harvey. Credit Joe Raedle/Getty Images", "Teasing out the influence of climate change on hurricanes remains extremely problematic, Dr. van Oldenborgh said. \u201cThe effect of climate change on hurricanes is horribly complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it, but it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d But the more limited analysis, determining the influence of warming on the rainfall of a huge storm like Harvey \u201cturns out to be a solvable problem,\u201d Dr. van Oldenborgh said. The studies are the latest in a series of analyses that search for the fingerprints of climate change on individual weather events like storms or heat waves. Despite overwhelming evidence that the climate is changing overall because of greenhouse gases emissions, for years most scientists had said it was extremely difficult to link warming to specific events. That has now changed, with studies in recent years that found that climate change affected Australian heat waves in 2013, downpours in Louisiana in 2016, floods in France that same year and many other events. In some cases \u2014 German floods around the same time as the French ones, for example \u2014 studies have been inconclusive or found no link to climate change. Although there were some differences, the two current studies employed the same basic approach \u2014 making use of actual data from the storm, and comparing two sets of climate models, those that take into account existing conditions, in which rising carbon dioxide has warmed the planet, and those that assume CO2 emissions had never happened and the climate is as it was more than a century ago. Dr. Titley, who served as chairman of a National Academies committee that looked at developments in the field of climate-change attribution, said that both studies were \u201ccarefully done and combine observations with the latest simulation techniques.\u201d Dr. Wehner\u2019s study, in particular, raises the issue of whether climate change might have contributed to the slow motion of Harvey, a subject that Dr. Titley said was worthy of further research.

College-educated women have been a big source of support for Mrs. Clinton. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times", "It\u2019s probably the biggest demographic story of this election: Hillary Clinton has made big gains with well-educated whites, particularly women. And Donald J. Trump has continued recent Republican gains in winning over less educated whites, particularly men. As Nate Cohn wrote in an article last month, education has replaced the culture wars as the defining electoral divide. But what exactly do we mean by \u201ceducated\u201d? Some Upshot readers, responding to the article, suggested it was about intelligence \u2014 that college-educated people can see through Mr. Trump because they\u2019re smart. You must mean high I.Q. v. low I.Q. when you say \u2018college educated\u2019 v. working class. The truth is, we are talking about smart people against not-so-smart people. \u2014 Mike Barker of Arizona I wouldn\u2019t say that Hillary is \u201cstruggling\u201d with less educated voters. I think the issue is that the world is more complex than it has ever been, and these voters don\u2019t understand our legal system, our electoral system, journalism, trade issues, the deficit, taxation, the Fed, NATO, the U.N., cyber espionage, immigration, counterterrorism, nuclear policy, diplomacy, the Geneva Conventions or the Constitution. \u2014 Jch of NY The I.Q. connection is purely speculative; no rigorous studies have been published to support it. Other readers warned against the temptation to stereotype, pointing to various explanations and showing how difficult it is to come to definitive conclusions about the education correlation. It\u2019s About What You Learn These days, the highly educated tend to be liberal. A Pew Research center study showed this growing connection among those with graduate degrees. Some readers said it had to do with what you learn at college: You become \u201ceducated.\u201d When I started university, I was taken aback by how much I didn\u2019t know. It was exhilarating. Postsecondary education develops intangibles like the ability to think critically, and I think this explains why non-college-educated audiences are so vulnerable to exploitation by a Pied Piper like Trump. \u2014 Aaron, Phoenix Another reader highlighted the advantages of encountering different points of view on campus. Higher ed is where a lot of people from conservative families find out that there are other ways to look at the world than through narrow religious and political ideologies; where they learn to question authority and distinguish between fact and opinion; where they discover that there are many people different from them in myriad ways who also matter. \u2014 Katherine Bailey, Florida No, It\u2019s About Credentials and Social Class What if you mostly goof off at college \u2014 beer pong at the fraternity instead of bearing down at the library \u2014 but manage to get a degree? You may not be \u201ceducated\u201d but you still have an edge in the job market: The degree can be a ticket to a good job and the good life. If you don\u2019t have that credential, you may feel left out and frustrated \u2014 and more willing to shake things up with Mr. Trump. This election is divided along class lines. Why do we have such difficulty saying so? The invocation of education as the prime delineating factor among the electorate is just another way to avoid saying the C-word. We\u2019re not really talking about education, after all. We\u2019re not talking about how well-read these people are, about their skills at differential calculus, or whether they can say snarky things at cocktail parties about the shoddy curation of the Tribeca Film Festival. No, we\u2019re talking about the resentment that poorer people feel toward the accredited classes.\u201d \u2014 Squidge Bailey, Brooklyn It\u2019s worth mentioning that income is not nearly as predictive of presidential preference in this election as education. Trump supporters are not as poor as a lot of people think. And at the highest levels of income, the rich are set to reverse a decades-long pattern and support a Democratic presidential candidate. Or, You\u2019re Learning the Wrong Things Several readers blamed left-wing bias on campus, particularly among professors \u2014 or as one reader, L\u2019Osservatore, put it, \u201cthe unquestioned control of collectivists and socialists on 95 percent of college campuses.\u201d When you have \u201csafe zones\u201d where ideas cannot be discussed and explored, you have indoctrination. Liberals have done all they can to dictate learning in America for over 40 years. \u2014 MRS Little Rock, Ark. Why do the college-educated tend to vote Democrat? Simple. A young person entering any American college will take humanities courses in philosophy, literature, history, the social sciences, all taught by strongly left-leaning Democrats. It is impossible that they should emerge from this experience ideologically untouched. All this I well know as a recently retired conservative academic of 40-plus years \u2014 the only Republican in a department of 22 professors.\u201d \u2014 Rob, N.C. Studies have shown that professors have in fact become more liberal, with faculty members in New England standing out as far more liberal than the rest. A group of professors, frustrated by this trend, has compiled a Heterodox Academy ranking of colleges based on ideological diversity. But other readers, pointing to examples like the rejection by many Republicans of the science on climate change, said there was an \u201canti-intellectual\u201d strain in the modern G.O.P. (Political science aficionados will think back to the book  \u201cAnti-Intellectualism in American Life\u201d by Richard Hofstadter.) Jane of Santa Rosa said, \u201cThis is why Donald Trump \u2014 and the G.O.P. by extension \u2014 \u2018love the poorly educated.\u2019 \u201d In 2012, the Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum called President Obama \u201ca snob\u201d for urging students to pursue college. Santorum: Obama \"A Snob\" For Wanting Everyone To Go To College Video by tpmtv A reader, John of Los Angeles, said of conservative complaints of one-sidedness: \u201cAlternatively: Facts have a liberal bias.\u201d Maybe It\u2019s About Location The clustering of like-minded people \u2014 the so-called Big Sort \u2014 has been underway for quite a while, but the effect on political preferences seems to be accelerating in this election. Region plays a role. In 2012, President Obama won a fairly high percentage of the white working class in Wisconsin and Minnesota, states with a tradition of labor rights and Progressive values. He didn\u2019t do nearly as well with working-class whites in Southern states.", "Top States as Measured by Diplomas Hillary Clinton is favored to win each of these 15 states and the District of Columbia.", "Educated white voters are more likely to live in big cities or near them, areas that have had better job growth and that tend to lean liberal. The mostly liberal Northeast has the highest percentage of college graduates \u2014 you\u2019re more likely to be expected to go to college \u2014 and the populous Northeast megalopolis, for example, draws college graduates searching for jobs. College graduates from rural towns who move to a metropolitan area for work may have their views influenced by their new environment and social circles. It\u2019s also possible that their views and interests may prompt them to move, whether in search of cultural opportunities or like-minded people. The result is social polarization by place. Wisconsin is a good state to look at to see the class divisions. Trump is more popular in the counties where people are less educated and more rural and small town. In Trump country, Wisconsin, there\u2019s resentment of the quality of schools in and around Madison and Milwaukee, yet they don\u2019t want to look at how their aggressive attack on teachers and public education has convinced teachers to flock to areas where they are respected and paid well. \u2014 Jcarpenter, Midwest Living in a blue city in a solidly red state, I think there is a rural/urban dynamic that many are overlooking. It\u2019s less about educated vs. uneducated. A whole way of life, instead of fading quietly away, is going out with a bang. No one is putting their start-up next to the grain elevator in a town with one stoplight. \u2014 Jamie, Sioux Falls, S.D. I think educated people support Democrats because they have better employment opportunities over a lifetime, not because they read philosophy in college. If you live in the I-95 corridor, the communities show growth and opportunities for education. If you live in small towns in the industrial heartland, your employment opportunities are limited. \u2014 Mary Mac, New Jersey Or, About Rational Policy Preferences A reader, William Hayes of Houston, said, \u201cTrump promises jobs by rolling back globalization, which appeals to the undereducated, not because they\u2019re stupid, but because they believe decreasing globalization will help them get good jobs.\u201d The \u201ceducational\u201d divide is a red herring. We are going to have to think long and hard about the best way to address wealth inequity in a post-manufacturing economy. \u2014 BLM, Niagara Falls Working-class whites have more to lose from Clinton\u2019s preference for more free trade pacts and continued de facto open borders. It\u2019s really simple as that. \u2014 Chloe, New England What About Education and Tolerance? A reminder here that the education correlation is among whites only. Nonwhites may have other priorities in assessing Mr. Trump. A reader, Space Needle from Seattle, wondered if Trump supporters were \u201csimply angry about their perceived loss of power in a society growing increasingly diverse.\u201d An article in The Times today explores \u201cwhite anxiety that has fueled political tumult\u201d not just in the United States, but throughout the Western world. Perhaps the demographic factor is not so much one\u2019s college experience, but rather the level of exposure a person has to persons of different social, sexual and cultural backgrounds, education levels, wealth and ethnicity, i.e. diversity. \u2014 David, California I can\u2019t say what drives the divide in your areas, but in mine (South Alabama), it is almost always race. The only exception is religion. \u2014 Willard Douglas, Alabama Suburban and moderate white voters may be uncomfortable with more explicit appeals to racial, ethnic and religious resentment \u2014 and those who have the college credential would have less reason for scapegoating. Some studies have shown that education can increase tolerance, but there\u2019s also evidence suggesting the effect can be overstated when it comes to race. How Age and Education Connect One overlooked factor is Mr. Trump\u2019s success with older voters. He has polled much better among those over 65 than among millennials, perhaps because of his appeal to return America to perceived glory days. Ed Kilgore of New York magazine said calling people \u201cwhite working class\u201d because they don\u2019t have a diploma can be misleading: \u201cIt is important to understand that a majority of today\u2019s seniors came of age at a time when a college education really was not necessary for most jobs \u2014 in many cases even management-track jobs.\u201d Educational attainment has been rising for decades. In the late 1960s, only about 10 percent of Americans had bachelor\u2019s degrees. Today, that number is almost 33 percent, and for whites, it is around 36 percent. People with degrees tend to be more reliable voters. The trends are clear. Each year, educational attainment of the public is increasing, and that does not bode well for Republicans. \u2014 Tom, Midwest A Plea for Understanding Two readers had advice for Democrats: As a white male without a college degree, I think maybe you shouldn\u2019t make such sweeping generalizations about an entire group of people. This is why we liberals have a hard time making inroads with this group. \u2014 Brett Hudgins of Seattle Perhaps uneducated whites would be more open to the policies of the Democratic Party if they were approached with greater respect from the Left. Is anyone surprised that uneducated whites are unreceptive to individuals who castigate them as being inherently racist and incompetent? Would any reasonable person expect Latinos to view Trump favorably after he stereotyped them all as being rapists and criminals? \u2014 Addy, U.S. Have we missed any reasons that white Americans with college degrees are less likely to support Mr. Trump? Let us know in the comments. Update: A reader, DrJ. of Pa., adds a comment about the possible impact of religion. Mr. Trump is the overwhelming favorite of evangelical Christians: \u201cI think it\u2019s relevant that conservatives are by and large more religious, certainly more fundamentally religious, than liberals. But religious SCHOLARS are not so religious. \u201cIn religion, the open mind and love of scholarship leads one away from the path of the true believer. The desire to cling to tradition (and, I would say, superstition) leads these conservatives to be less likely to pursue education and scholarship.\u201d Update: It turns out that Mr. Trump himself has said that people are simply born smart (or not). He said he\u2019s a \u201cgene believer.\u201d Donald Trump: Eugenics? Video by Fascist Archives The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own.  (CNN) Sarah Sanders is teaching us a thing or two about the definition of confounding. As in, bewildering, astonishing, baffling, perplexing, mystifying or -- just plain confusing.  Keli Goff, who writes for The Daily Beast, told me, \"Someday 100 Ph.D. theses will be written on Sarah Sanders.\" It's difficult for many women to understand how a woman can so glibly defend men who are accused of sexual harassment.  It's one thing to say your boss -- Donald Trump -- denies the allegations leveled against him by at least 15 women, but quite another to come up with a tortured, yet clever, way to discount Trump's female accusers. \"The people of this country, at a decisive election, supported President Trump,\" Sanders said this week. \"And we feel like these allegations have been answered through that process.\"", "Even more confounding to her critics, Sanders has also praised Trump for his behavior toward her. \"Certainly, as a woman myself, I've never felt anything but treated with the highest level of respect and been empowered to do my job. And I think that's what I've seen the President do, day in and day out, since we've been here and during the campaign.\"  Read More Sanders' verbal gymnastics enrage and astound liberal women. \"She's amazing. Amazing how she doesn't even flinch when she has to say these incredibly absurd things,\" Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman told me on HLN. MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski has called for Sanders to resign unless she \"apologizes\" for Trump \"being a sexist pig\" over his suggestive tweet about Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. As you know by now, Trump tweeted that Gillibrand \"would do anything\" for campaign donations. I don't think Sanders will resign, Mika, but I find it fascinating how women are reacting to Sanders' moxie (if you lean Trump) or her sometimes convoluted answers -- like a verbal game of \"Twister\" (if you prefer factual press briefings).  It's become hysterical. And not in a funny way. Which brings me to Chelsea Handler. The feminist activist and entertainer seems befuddled when it comes to criticizing a woman who has a job only two other women have held in the history of this country: Dee Dee Myers and Dana Perino. Handler has not only called Sanders a \"trollop,\" but has portrayed her as a hick who is just plain dumb.  Handler tweeted a video of a faux Sanders in a \"makeup tutorial.\" The comedian portraying Sanders talks in a stereotypical Southern accent and is slathering her face with excessive amounts of makeup.", "JUST WATCHED CNN to WH: Is Moore support a moral question?

Later, in the video faux Sanders paints her lips \"Republican red\" and says, \"The more lipstick you use, the younger you look. In fact, the other day Roy Moore tried to pick me up.\"  The schtick is not funny or clever. It's just plain mean. And it invalidates every sound argument Handler might have. Although, oddly, Sanders' father, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, seems just as confounded about his daughter as the hysterical, liberal left. Huckabee rushed to his daughter's defense on \"Fox and Friends,\" but instead of extolling her prowess at what must be a difficult job, he brought up abortion and parenting. \"The sad thing about it is she (Handler) boasts about two abortions she had at 16,\" Huckabee said. \"I think she's jealous of my daughter. My daughter has a husband who loves her and is wonderful to her. My daughter has three delightful children. ... She goes to church and lives a life Chelsea Handler has never known.\"  In other words, Handler, a bitter, godless baby-killer should shut up about this daughter/wife/mother.  It's like \"Mean Girls\" meets \"Footloose,\" that '80s movie featuring an uptight local minister who insisted everyone abide by '50s-style norms. However, none of this rhetoric makes it any easier to understand why Sanders, a mother of three, lies for a man who defended Roy Moore, an accused child molester. Join us on Twitter and Facebook And if I were to try to address this seeming dissonance, I would do it without denigrating Sanders' appearance or extolling her family values -- because, frankly, who cares? I believe we're way overthinking things. Sanders has a job to do, and she's doing it more effectively, at least in her boss' mind, than her predecessor, Sean Spicer.

The death sentence against Mr. Hussein is still under review by an appeals court, but hundreds of people have already started lobbying the prime minister\u2019s office for the position. They have sent messages through cabinet officials and their assistants, and by way of government guards and clerical workers. One candidate, an Iraqi Shiite living in London whose brother was killed by Mr. Hussein, telephoned an aide to the prime minister to say he was prepared to drop everything and fly to Baghdad to execute the former ruler. \u201cOne of the hardest tasks will be to determine who gets to be the hangman because so many people want revenge for the loss of their loved ones,\u201d said Basam Ridha, an adviser to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. Mr. Hussein and two of his top associates, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti and Awad al-Bandar, were sentenced to \u201cdeath by hanging\u201d on Nov. 5 for their involvement in the arrest and killings of 148 men and boys after an assassination attempt against him in the town of Dujail in 1982. The nine-judge appeals bench has no time limit to issue its ruling, but if it upholds the death sentence, Mr. Hussein\u2019s execution must be carried out within 30 days. Iraqi judicial officials said they expected that the appeals process would be completed in a matter of weeks and, if the sentence is upheld, that Mr. Hussein\u2019s hanging would take place between mid-January and mid-March. The Shiite-led government has argued for a swift execution, saying that as long as Mr. Hussein is alive, he remains a powerful source of motivation for elements of the Sunni Arab insurgency fighting to restore him to power. There are other critical issues the government will need to decide should the appeals court uphold the death sentence against Mr. Hussein, including where he will be executed. Officials have considered staging a public hanging in Baghdad\u2019s largest sports arena, Shaab Stadium, and filling the place with tens of thousands of spectators, according to a high-ranking government official involved in the executions process, who agreed to discuss the subject on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about it on the record. But while such a spectacle might satisfy a communal need for closure, the authorities have rejected the idea for security reasons. A target that big, they say, would be highly vulnerable to attack by Sunni insurgents who might try to lob a few mortar shells into the crowd or ambush spectators on their way to and from the event. Government hangings are now conducted in a prison complex in eastern Baghdad. Mr. Hussein, who is being held at Camp Cropper, an American military prison near Baghdad International Airport, could be transported to those gallows by helicopter. But officials worry that the trip would present an unnecessary opportunity for a rescue attempt by his sympathizers. Most likely, officials say, Mr. Hussein will be hanged at gallows specially built for him at Camp Cropper. The death penalty in Iraq, which applies to a range of crimes including terrorism and certain categories of murder, was suspended in 2003 by the American occupation authorities but reinstated in August 2004. Since then, 51 people \u2014 men and several women \u2014 have been hanged and about 170 are currently on death row awaiting execution or the outcome of their appeal, according to Hashim al-Shibli, Iraq\u2019s justice minister. Those are the official numbers. The high-ranking government official involved in the executions process said the actual number of hangings was far higher, though fewer than 100, because of three sets of hangings that took place between December 2005 and March 2006 and were never publicized. Human rights groups have questioned the transparency of the criminal justice system in Iraq and the ability of defendants to get a fair trial. And the United Nations has requested that the Iraqi government commute the sentences of all the prisoners on Iraq\u2019s death row. But Iraqi leaders have rebuffed calls for the abolishment of the death penalty, arguing that it serves as a deterrent to crimes.", "Saddam Hussein yelled in court on Nov. 5 after he was found guilty in his first trial for war crimes. He was sentenced to death by hanging. Credit Pool photo by David Furst", "\u201cMaliki wants to show decisiveness that people should be punished,\u201d said Mr. Ridha, Mr. Maliki\u2019s adviser. \u201cHe is very anxious that these executions take place in a timely manner.\u201d He added, \u201cThe number of executions that have taken place is not a great number compared to the number of insurgents in the country.\u201d The gallows are in a concrete building within a heavily guarded prison complex in eastern Baghdad, near the headquarters of the Interior Ministry. Two scaffolds made of steel sit side by side in an otherwise unadorned room, according to the high-ranking government official, who has attended hangings there. (The Justice Ministry and the Maliki administration denied requests to visit the prison and, citing security concerns, refused to give the precise location of the site.) The government prefers to conduct several hangings in a day for the sake of efficiency. Men condemned to death are held on Iraq\u2019s death row \u2014 a wing of rudimentary cells, separated from other inmates in the prison compound. Condemned women are held at a women\u2019s prison in Khadamiya, a neighborhood in northern Baghdad. The prisoners are told they will be hanged on the morning of their executions, officials said. They are led out of their cells in single file, dressed in orange jumpsuits, their ankles and wrists manacled, and taken to a room off the gallows chambers, where they are allowed to sit on floor cushions. There, they are permitted to pray. They can eat a last meal if they request it, or smoke a cigarette. They are given an opportunity to compose a last will and testament. Then, two by two and hooded, they are taken to the gallows. The victims are led up a set of steel stairs to a platform, about 15 feet above the ground, and nooses fashioned from one-and-a-quarter-inch-thick hemp ropes are slipped over their necks. The executioners are different each time, drawn from among employees of the Justice Ministry who volunteer for the job. Many have lost relatives or friends in insurgent attacks, officials said. With a tug of two large levers, the steel trapdoors drop open and the victims fall through. The doors make a loud clanging sound as they slam against the apparatus, according to people who have witnessed hangings. The jarring noise echoes off the cold, unadorned concrete walls. Death is supposed to come instantly \u2014 a doctor is on hand to certify it \u2014 and the bodies are removed to a cooler where they are held before being handed over to the victims\u2019 families. The entire process is recorded by a photographer and a video cameraman and the images are stored in a government archive. But the hangings have not always gone smoothly. Until the new gallows were built, the Iraqi government used an apparatus and an old rope left over from Mr. Hussein\u2019s government, said the high-ranking government official. The rope had become so elastic that it would sometimes take as much as eight minutes to kill the convicted person. On Sept. 6, the Iraqi authorities planned to hang 27 people. On the 13th hanging, according to an official who was there, the rope snapped and the convicted man plummeted 15 feet through the trap door onto the concrete floor. \u201cGod saved me!\u201d the man cried. \u201cGod is great! I did not deserve this!\u201d For an hour, he lay on the ground praying and shouting while prison guards and the executioner debated whether this constituted divine intervention and, if so, whether the man\u2019s life should be spared. Once a new rope was rigged, however, the man was forced up the stairs once again and successfully hanged. The incident was first reported in Time magazine of Nov. 20. The executions are conducted in secrecy to avert insurgent attacks. On March 9, a government convoy carrying a representative from the administration of Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari was ambushed on its way to the gallows. It was an unsuccessful effort to stop the representative from observing the day\u2019s hangings, including the execution of Shukair Farid, a murderous former police officer whom the government had nicknamed \u201cthe butcher of Mosul.\u201d On another execution day, word leaked out and insurgents pelted the prison facility with mortar shells. The Iraqi subcontractors who built the new gallows, under the auspices of an American contractor, were forced to interrupt work several times because of threats by insurgents, officials said. The current hanging procedures are an improvement over the methods used by Mr. Hussein, who conducted mass executions in a hangarlike building at Abu Ghraib prison. According to human rights groups, hundreds of prisoners were executed in a span of a few weeks in the 1990s to address prison overcrowding. Mr. Hussein himself asked the court to execute him by firing squad, the method used for soldiers sentenced to death. He said it was his right because he was commander in chief of Iraq\u2019s armed forces at the time of the events in Dujail. His request was denied. The protocols for his hanging have not yet been determined, including who will get to attend, Maliki administration officials said. In a standard Iraqi hanging, the attendance is limited to representatives from the Justice Ministry, the Interior Ministry and the prime minister\u2019s office, and a doctor. Mr. Shibli, the justice minister, said the convict\u2019s lawyer was allowed to attend, as well as a member of the clergy of the victim\u2019s choice, though in practice they rarely do. The usual videographer and photographer will probably be on hand, as well, to record the hanging, officials said, and excerpts of the event may be shown later on national television. Mr. Ridha says the Iraqi people will want to see it. Abdul Razzaq al-Saeidi contributed reporting.
