Antarctic sea ice extent has been monitored since 1979.\n Sea ice is back to record-low extent in the Antarctic https://t.co/3BIO0oDtr5 pic.twitter.com/MWJszYAPYK\n \u2014 Bob Henson (@bhensonweather) June 26, 2017\nThe extent of Antarctic sea ice in recent months \u2013 near and at record low levels \u2013 marks a dramatic reversal from past years.\nThe original version of this article (see below), published in September 2013, was headlined \u201cAntarctic sea ice hit 35-year record high\u201d. But there has been a marked decline in Antarctic ice extent ever since.\n\n Antarctic sea ice extent since 1979. (NASA, adapted by CWG) \nWhen this story previously highlighted the record high Antarctic sea ice extent, some who deny climate change shared it to sow doubt about the reality of climate warming. But as I explained then (see below), and reiterate now, Antarctic sea ice behavior is not a straight forward or terribly useful indicator of climate change because it is influenced by many factors beyond temperature.\nOf course, now that the Antarctic sea ice is at record low levels, it makes citing Antarctic sea ice data as evidence refuting global warming even more preposterous. Yet at the same time, because Antarctic sea ice trends are so complex and variable, it\u2019s also unwise to tout the current level as an unambiguous indicator of climate warming.\n\u201cIt is tempting to say that the record low we are seeing this year is global warming finally catching up with Antarctica,\u201d said Walt Meier, sea ice specialist at NASA. \u201cHowever, this might just be an extreme case of pushing the envelope of year-to-year variability. We\u2019ll need to have several more years of data to be able to say there has been a significant change in the trend.\u201d\nMore straight forward indicators of climate change include ocean heat content, sea level rise, Arctic sea ice (currently near record low levels), and of course, surface and atmospheric temperatures. And all of these indicators show the Earth is warming and support multiple lines of evidence that this warming is mostly human-caused.\nOriginal post from September 23, 2013\n\n Antarctic sea ice extent on September 22 compared to 1981-2010 median depicted by orange curve (NSIDC) \nAntarctic sea ice has grown to a record large extent for a second straight year, baffling scientists seeking to understand why this ice is expanding rather than shrinking in a warming world.\nOn Saturday, the ice extent reached 19.51 million square kilometers, according to data posted on the National Snow and Ice Data Center Web site. That number bested record high levels set earlier this month and in 2012 (of 19.48 million square kilometers). Records date back to October 1978.\n\n (NSIDC) \nThe increasing ice is especially perplexing since the water beneath the ice has warmed, not cooled.\n\u201cThe overwhelming evidence is that the Southern Ocean is warming,\u201d said Jinlun Zhang, a University of Washington scientist, studying Antarctic ice. \u201cWhy would sea ice be increasing? Although the rate of increase is small, it is a puzzle to scientists.\u201d\nIn a new study in the Journal of Climate, Zhang finds both strengthening and converging winds around the South Pole can explain 80 percent of the increase in ice volume which has been observed.\n\u201cThe polar vortex that swirls around the South Pole is not just stronger than it was when satellite records began in the 1970s, it has more convergence, meaning it shoves the sea ice together to cause ridging,\u201d the study\u2019s press release explains. \u201cStronger winds also drive ice faster, which leads to still more deformation and ridging. This creates thicker, longer-lasting ice, while exposing surrounding water and thin ice to the blistering cold winds that cause more ice growth.\u201d\nBut no one seems to have a conclusive answer as to why winds are behaving this way.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a clear explanation yet of why the winds have gotten stronger,\u201d Zhang told Michael Lemonick of Climate Central.\nSome point to stratospheric ozone depletion, but a new study published in the Journal of Climate notes that computer models simulate declining \u2013 not increasing \u2013 Antarctic sea ice in recent decades due to this phenomenon (aka the ozone \u201chole\u201d).\n\u201cThis modeled Antarctic sea ice decrease in the last three decades is at odds with observations, which show a small yet statistically significant increase in sea ice extent,\u201d says the study, led by Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Elizabeth Barnes.\nA recent study by Lorenzo Polvani and Karen Smith of Columbia University says the model-defying sea ice increase may just reflect natural variability.\nIf the increase in ice is due to natural variability, Zhang says, warming from manmade greenhouse gases should eventually overcome it and cause the ice to begin retreating.\n\u201cIf the warming continues, at some point the trend will reverse,\u201d Zhang said.\nHowever, a conclusion of the Barnes study is that the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer \u2013 now underway \u2013 may slow/delay Antarctic warming and ice melt.\nUltimately, it\u2019s apparent the relationship between ozone depletion, climate warming from greenhouse gases, natural variability, and how Antarctic ice responds is all very complicated. In sharp contrast, in the Arctic, there seems to be a relatively straight forward relationship between temperature and ice extent.\nThus, in the Antarctic, we shouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to witness the kind of steep decline in ice that has occurred in the Arctic.\n\u201c\u2026the seeming paradox of Antarctic ice increasing while Arctic ice is decreasing is really no paradox at all,\u201d explains Climate Central\u2019s Lemonick. \u201cThe Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land, while the Antarctic is land surrounded by ocean. In the Arctic, moreover, you\u2019ve got sea ice decreasing in the summer; at the opposite pole, you\u2019ve got sea ice increasing in the winter. It\u2019s not just an apples-and-oranges comparison: it\u2019s more like comparing apple pie with orange juice.\u201d"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article reports and analyzes scientific data on Antarctic sea ice extent from the National Snow and Ice Data Center and NASA, discusses trends, historical records, and the scientific interpretation of those findings in the context of climate variability."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_science_to_scientific_0"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "93.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Want to fix sexual harassment?

This piece is based on his books \"The No Asshole Rule\" (Business Plus, 2007) and \"The Asshole Survival Guide\" (HMH, 2017). Unless otherwise noted, the facts in this piece reflect research from those works. The views expressed here are solely those of the author.\n (CNN)\nReporters and radio and television hosts. Film producers. A US senator and other members of Congress. Candidates for office and leaders of startups. By now, you'd have to be living under a rock not to see the impact the accusations of workplace harassment and assault are having on industry, culture and politics. Time Magazine has named the \"Silence Breakers\" its person of the year. Politicians have resigned from office or are choosing not to run again. Americans everywhere are driving themselves crazy asking: What do we do next? How can we fix this problem? Do we need new hiring practices, better HR procedures? \n\nRobert Sutton \n There's actually a simpler way to screen for many sexual harassers: Use interviews, background checks, trial periods and other employee selection methods. And just don't hire the jerks. \nHere's what I mean.\nAbout 10 years ago, I was talking with a Silicon Valley executive about my research on workplace jerks (I call them a**holes). By 2007, hundreds of careful studies had showed that \"certified a**holes\" (people who routinely leave others feeling demeaned, de-energized, and disrespected) undermine their colleagues' health and productivity. In 2006, for example, The Ohio State University's Bennett Tepper and his colleagues estimated the damage that abusive supervisors inflict on employees cost US companies $23.8 billion a year. \nThe executive responded that estimating the \"TCA\" (total cost of a**holes) was more than an intellectual exercise in his company. \nRead More\nHe told me about his company's star salesperson, who was also a flaming jerk. Let's call him \"Ethan.\" Ethan routinely screamed at and belittled peers, underlings and bosses. His angry late-night email rants were legendary. Many colleagues refused to work with him, and his assistants rarely lasted longer than a year. Finally, after Ethan hollered at and insulted an HR employee about a small increase in health care costs that was beyond her control, company executives had enough of his antics. They instructed HR staffers to calculate Ethan's personal \"TCA\" for the prior year. \n\nTheir calculations indicated that the costs of Ethan's bad behavior included extra time spent by managers, executives and HR staffers dealing with him and his victims; hiring employment lawyers to clean up Ethan's messes; paying damages to Ethan's victims (including a former assistant); hiring and recruiting Ethan's new assistant; and Ethan's anger management training. The HR staffers estimated the cost of this one jerk to the company for one year was $160,000. \nOf course, Ethan flew into a rage and threatened to quit when senior executives informed him that, because of these costs, his bonus would be cut about 60%. Ethan ended up staying, in part, because he was a known jerk and so competitors weren't interested in hiring him. Ethan's behavior improved for several months, but he soon reverted back to his nasty ways. \nWhen it comes to hiring and protecting yourself and others from workplace jerks, remember Leonardo da Vinci's advice that, \"It is easier to resist at the beginning than the end.\" Do your homework before offering that star a job; someone else's problem soon become yours. And if you make a mistake and hire demeaning, selfish and disrespectful jerks, call them out on their behavior early and often. If that doesn't work, send them packing.\nThe evidence about damage done by certified jerks like Ethan was strong when I heard his story back in 2006. And it is even stronger now. Ethan's sins are mild compared to the alleged sexual assault and harassment that accusers say was committed by stars, such as Bill O'Reilly, Matt Lauer, and Harvey Weinstein. Lauer apologized but said \"some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized,\" while O'Reilly and Weinstein have both denied the allegations. \nThese high-profile cases have caused companies to reconsider the risks of looking the other way when stars are allegedly sexual predators or serial sexist pigs -- and to avoid hiring stars who are known creeps. Although their alleged crimes are less despicable and perhaps even more socially acceptable, similar lessons apply to dealing with and hiring garden-variety jerks -- who demean and insult others, spread vicious lies about colleagues, or treat them as if they are worthless and invisible. \n\nThere has been an explosion in recent years of academic research on workplace bullying and incivility. For example, a search of Google Scholar reveals more than 7,000 academic articles that have been published on abusive supervision since 2007. The careful studies that underpin Christine Porath's 2017 book Mastering Civility and my \"Asshole Survival Guide\" show that bullying and rudeness harm employees' mental and physical health (including increased risk of heart attacks and death); damage relationships with friends and family; cause the best employees to quit; undermine employee effort, productivity and creativity; and erode empathy for and service to clients and customers. \nIf you are thinking about hiring a jerk even in the face of all this information, consider that studies also show rudeness spreads from one person to another like the common cold. And other evidence suggests that jerks are attracted to, or at least more accepting, of jerks like them. The abuse by senior leaders appears to \"roll down\" the hierarchy, so they hire (or infect) supervisors who, in turn, abuse their underlings. So hiring that jerk increases the risk that you will be knee-deep in mean-spirited colleagues, and that you will become a jerk, too. \nI acknowledge that some stars are so creative, bring in so much money, attract so much attention, or win so much that it is difficult to resist recruiting, tolerating, indulging and celebrating them. But beware of the price you and others may pay for being exposed to and enabling these bullies to succeed. \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\nCertified a**holes not only put your health, most precious relationships, and performance at risk. When they are outed and ousted, the guilt by association may mean that the stain spreads to you and ruins your career, too. \nAnd even if you get away with it, if you benefit from hiring, hanging out with, or protecting someone who is a winner and a jerk (or if you are one yourself), you are still a loser as a human being in my book. After all, your success is tainted by the damage that the certified a**hole inflicts on others day after day. \nPaid Partner Content"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.92", "GPT Reasoning: The piece is written by an organizational psychologist and explicitly draws on and cites empirical research and studies about workplace 'jerks' and harassment (e.g., Bennett Tepper's cost estimate), so it primarily reports and discusses scientific findings in social/organizational psychology."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_science_to_scientific_1"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "509.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Why comfort foods make us feel better \u2014 and how to make them healthier"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Why we crave comfort foods \u2014 and how to make them healthier\nGiving into your cravings and sticking to your health goals can go hand-in-hand.\nby Brianna Steinhilber / Jan.24.2018 / 5:34 PM ET\n\n\n\n\nThese Dark Chocolate Almond Oatmeal Cookies with Sea Salt use fiber-rich rolled oats, almond butter for a boost of protein and dark chocolate chips.Kara Lydon\nGet the Better newsletter.\nA stressful day at the office. A fight with your significant other. A stretch of cold, dreary weather that has you feeling the winter blues.\nChances are, all of these scenarios trigger that hankering for a certain comfort food.\nPeople tend to seek high-calorie, high-fat foods during periods of stress. Thirty-eight percent of adults report that they have overeaten or eaten unhealthy foods in the past month because of stress, according to the American Psychological Association. People feeling sad also tend to eat more of less-healthy comfort foods than when they feel happy, according to research out of Cornell University.\nWhen stress, seasonal blues or sadness has you looking for comfort in the cupboard, what is it that you reach for?\nRanker recently conducted a survey to determine which comfort foods are the most loved by Americans, and the foods that top the list comes as no surprise: chocolate, grilled cheese, pizza \u2026\nWhy exactly are these comfort foods so, well, comforting? A study published in the journal Appetite found that there is a \u201csocial\u201d component to foods that provide us solace: A food is comforting because of the memories they evoke, and the emotions and relationships that we associate with them. If your grandmother served you chocolate chip cookies as a child that may be why you make a pit stop at the bakery on your way home from the office after a particularly stressful day.\n\u201cComfort foods are often the foods that our caregivers gave us when we were children. As long we have positive association with the person who made that food then there\u2019s a good chance that you will be drawn to that food during times of rejection or isolation,\u201d says Shira Gabriel, psychologist at the University of Buffalo and co-author of the study. \u201cThe study helps us understand why we might be eating comfort foods even when we\u2019re dieting or not particularly hungry.\u201d\nAnother recent study published in the International Journal of Gastronomy and Food Science confirmed that certain foods take on their role as comfort food through the association with positive social encounters in our past. And while there\u2019s no requirement that those foods be indulgent or unhealthy, the Ranker survey reveals that our go-tos tend to be.\nBut fulfilling that comfort craving and sticking to your health goals don\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive. We\u2019ve rounded up some better-for-you versions of the top ten comfort food favorites to keep on hand for when you need a bite that will soothe the soul.\nHealthier ways to satisfy comfort food cravings\n\n\n\nMy Suburban Kitchen\n\nGrilled Cheese\nTopping the list of most comforting foods: Grilled cheese. Does that come as any surprise? Sometimes nothing can soothe the soul quite like melted cheese sandwiched between two slices of crusty bread. So we won\u2019t deprive you of either. Instead, simply make the bread whole grain, cut back on the butter and stuff it with veggies like in this recipe from My Suburban Kitchen.\n\n\n\nChocolate Covered Katie\n\nChocolate\nWe don\u2019t know about you, but one of our favorite ways to indulge a chocolate craving is in brownie form. Unfortunately, it tends to come with a hefty dose of added sugar. Not so with this Chocolate Zucchini Brownie recipe from Chocolate Covered Katie, which clock in at just 83 calories each, uses shredded zucchini and applesauce for moisture, and has half the amount of sugar as a typical brownie recipe.\n\n\n\nChocolate Covered Katie\n\nIce cream\nPerhaps you prefer your sugar fix frozen. Skip the tub and go homemade. This banana ice cream recipe from Chocolate Covered Katie has just two ingredients: bananas and your milk of choice. Use this as a base, and then add in your flavor of choice. Think: berries, vanilla, peanut butter, cocoa powder \u2026 the possibilities are endless.\n\n\n\nThe Roasted Root\n\nPizza\nIf you can't resist grabbing a slice (or two) after a bad day, you\u2019ll benefit from getting creative and making your \u201cpie\u201d at home. Keep the cheese and sauce (after all, it wouldn\u2019t be pizza without them), but shave off some calories by using veggies as your base. Cauliflower pizza crust is having a major moment and for good reason: when prepared correctly it's nearly as good as that dough-based slice. Another option: Portobello mushroom caps. The meaty texture holds up well slathered in sauce and cheese. Try this recipe from The Roasted Root, which is also stuffed with brown rice and spinach for a well-balanced meal that hits the flavor profile of your delivery.\n\n\n\nLaughing Spatula\n\nFrench fries\nFill that craving for French fries \u2014 no drive-thru necessary. These Baked Garlic Parmesan Potato Wedges from Laughing Spatula bake up in just 25 minutes and have a fraction of the unhealthy saturated fat that comes in the deep-fried fast food variety. Get creative with herbs and spices in place of the Parmesan cheese to cut back even more, or swap in sweet potato for an added nutrient boost.\n\n\n\nNikki Dinki Cooking\n\nMac and Cheese\nThere are lots of recipes that manage to make one of the ultimate comfort foods healthier, but when those boxed cravings hit, the only recipe you need is this Kraft-Style Mac and Cheese from Nikki Dinki Cooking. It achieves that nostalgic orange hue with sweet potato, and manages to sneak in some cauliflower too for extra creaminess. Don\u2019t worry, you still get to keep the cheese, but with no butter or milk, you\u2019re able to cut back on extra calories and fat.\n\n\n\nKara Lydon\n\nChocolate chip cookies\nCookies are never going to be something you can munch away at without abandon. But when the craving for the comfort food does hit, it\u2019s possible to whip up a batch that does less damage than Grandma's famous recipe, and even offers up a bit of nutritional benefit. These Dark Chocolate Almond Oatmeal Cookies with Sea Salt from Kara Lydon use fiber-rich rolled oats instead of flour, almond butter for a boost of protein and dark chocolate chips.\n\n\n\nThe Live Fit Girls\n\nMashed potatoes\nA few smart ingredient swaps can take the favorite from a diet don\u2019t to a guilt-free side dish. Instead of heavy cream and butter, The Live Fit Girls use olive oil and broth to keep the potatoes creamy and smooth while cutting way back on fat and calories in this recipe for Garlic Mashed Potatoes. You can also go the cauliflower route to cut back even more.\n\n\n\nPicasa / Ambitious Kitchen\n\nFried chicken\nThis Crispy Garlic and Parmesan Oven-Fried Chicken from Ambitious Kitchen delivers the same crunchy-outside-juicy-inside combo that\u2019s so comforting, but without the use of a deep fryer. Marinate chicken breasts in olive oil and Greek yogurt to keep them moist, and then coat in breadcrumbs and bake for a crispy finish.\n\n\n\nSkinnyTaste\n\nSpaghetti and meatballs\nDone in-house the traditional Italian dish can actually be a healthy dinner option. Opt for whole-wheat spaghetti, choose lean meat like SkinnyTaste does in this Skinny Italian Meatball recipe, and finish it off with a homemade sauce so that you control the added sugars. Or consider using eggplants and beans as your meatball base for a hearty, satisfying and meatless weeknight meal."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.88", "GPT Reasoning: The article summarizes and cites research findings (e.g., APA survey, Cornell research, a study in the journal Appetite) about stress, emotion, and comfort foods, framing advice around those studies."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_science_to_scientific_2"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "842.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Could biodiversity destruction lead to a global tipping point?"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["We are destroying the world\u2019s biodiversity.

Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\n Just over 250 million years ago, the planet suffered what may be described as its greatest holocaust: ninety-six percent of marine genera (plural of genus) and seventy percent of land vertebrate vanished for good. Even insects suffered a mass extinction \u2013 the only time before or since. Entire classes of animals \u2013 like trilobites \u2013 went out like a match in the wind. \n But what\u2019s arguably most fascinating about this event \u2013 known as the Permian-Triassic extinction or more poetically, the Great Dying \u2013 is the fact that anything survived at all. Life, it seems, is so ridiculously adaptable that not only did thousands of species make it through whatever killed off nearly everything (no one knows for certain though theories abound) but, somehow, after millions of years life even recovered and went on to write new tales.\n \nEven as the Permian-Triassic extinction event shows the fragility of life, it also proves its resilience in the long-term. The lessons of such mass extinctions \u2013 five to date and arguably a sixth happening as I write \u2013 inform science today. Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000 (some even say 10,000) times the background rate, researchers have long worried about our current destruction of biodiversity \u2013 and what that may mean for our future Earth and ourselves. \n \nIn 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes, biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it \u201cbiosphere integrity,\u201d but that hasn\u2019t spared it from critique. \n \nA paper last year in Trends in Ecology & Evolution scathingly attacked the idea of any global biodiversity boundary. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDying and dead coral after bleaching at Lizard Island, north of Cooktown, on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef. The image on the left from March 2016 is the coral after bleaching, the one on the right from May 2016 shows it after it has died and been blanketed by seaweed. Human-caused climate change is wiping out some reefs wholesale and many researchers fear coral reefs may not survive the century. Photograph: the Ocean Agency\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense that there exists a tipping point of biodiversity loss beyond which the Earth will collapse,\u201d said co-author and ecologist, Jos\u00e9 Montoya, with Paul Sabatier Univeristy in France. \u201cThere is no rationale for this.\u201d\n \nMontoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on extinctions, with Duke University in the US.\n \nMontoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that there isn\u2019t evidence of a point at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, globally or even locally. If the planet didn\u2019t collapse after the Permian-Triassic extinction event, it won\u2019t collapse now \u2013 though our descendants may well curse us for the damage we\u2019ve done. \nInstead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden plunge. Ecosystems, according to them, slowly degrade but never fail outright.\n \n\u201cOf more than 600 experiments of biodiversity effects on various functions, none showed a collapse,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cIn general, the loss of species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem functions...We progressively lose pollination services, water quality, plant biomass, and many other important functions as we lose species. But we never observe a critical level of biodiversity over which functions collapse.\u201d\n \nThis doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be deeply concerned about biodiversity, according to the researchers. Instead, we should worry about every species lost and not focus on a theoretical line in the sand. \n\u201cIt is in fact the planetary boundary argument that implies that there is a lot of biodiversity that has no value. There is no problem with losing a small number of species, the argument goes,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cWe argue that even small losses of biodiversity have important consequences for ecosystem function and service provisioning.\u201d\n \nIn other words, extinction of species may not result in a total collapse of our ecosystems \u2013 but the more we lose, the less productive, efficient, and healthy our environment will be. And the more at risk we put ourselves. \nBoundary scientists fire back \n But, the Stockholm Resilience Centre recently published a long response to Montoya\u2019s paper in the usual way of scientific sparring \u2013 publications going back and forth like boxers exchanging blows. \n Johan Rockstr\u00f6m the executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre and one of the leading researchers on planetary boundaries, said that Montoya\u2019s critique didn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny because its authors misunderstood the definitions built around the \u201cbiosphere integrity planetary boundary.\u201d \nRockstr\u00f6m agrees that there is no evidence of a planetary tipping point when it comes to biodiversity. According to Rockstr\u00f6m, biodiversity decline does not have a hard planetary boundary like, say, climate change. Instead he describes biodiversity as a variable that operates \u201cunder the hood of the planetary system\u201d because it influences the stability of our climate, ozone layer and oceans \u2013 all of which Rockstr\u00f6m contends have very clear planetary boundaries.\n \n A TED talk by Johan Rockstr\u00f6m. \n\u201cWe have never suggested a planetary scale biodiversity tipping point...\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m said. \u201cInstead, the rational for biodiversity as a planetary boundary is that the composition of trees, plants, microbes in soils, phytoplankton in oceans, top predators in ecosystems\u2026together constitute a fundamental core contributor to regulating the state of the planet.\u201d\n \nAccording to Rockstr\u00f6m, biodiversity is one of the pillars supporting our planet \u2013 and if too much biodiversity is lost we risk \u201ctriggering a tipping point\u201d in our climate or oceans, which in turn could risk pushing the planet into a new state.\n\u201cWithout biodiversity, no ecosystems. No ecosystems, no biomes. No biomes, no living regulator of all the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water,\u201d he added. \n \nRockstr\u00f6m says biodiversity loss could risk the \u201csafe operating space\u201d for humans, leaving us in an alien world increasingly hostile to our own survival. For example, life would still survive under apocalyptic climate change \u2013 but we may not.\n \nWhile ecosystems may not fully collapse, scientists have found that some ecosystems can undergo what they are called \u201cregime shifts.\u201d Coral reefs, overheated by climate change, will shift to a much less productive, much less biodiverse algae-based ecosystem. Climate change, or alternatively humans with chainsaws and fire, can shift forest ecosystems to grasslands. While none of these ecosystems may wholly collapse, they will look nothing like they did after the shift occurs. \nMontoya admits that such regime shifts \u201cdo actually happen\u201d and is \u201cwell established\u201d for some ecosystems \u2013 like forests, coral reefs and Arctic sea ice \u2013 though \u201cunclear\u201d if it happens in all ecosystems or only a few. \n \nAnd he adds, perhaps most importantly, that \u201cthe mechanisms [of regime shifts] have nothing to do with biodiversity loss.\u201d Instead, they have been driven by climate change or human actions \u2013 such as clear-cutting. \n Debating definitions\n\n It may be that unclear or shifting definitions are at the root of the dispute. \n \n\u201cFatally, the boundaries framework lacks clear definitions, or it has too many conflicting definitions, does not specify units, and fails to define terms operationally, thus prohibiting application by those who set policy,\u201d Montoya, Donohut and Pimm write in the paper.\n But Rockstr\u00f6m contends that when understood correctly the planetary boundary framework holds up to scientific scrutiny. He says planetary boundaries do not mean that humanity can just destroy and upend all the way up to a red line without consequences. \n \u201cThis is of course just nonsense,\u201d he noted, arguing that the planetary boundary for biosphere integrity is magnitudes more ambitious than the Aichi Targets from the Convention on Biological Diversity, an international agreement set on preserving biodiversity \u2013 though already several goals have not been met.\n \u201cIf the world is able to reduce biodiversity loss below the planetary boundary this would not only require major conservation efforts across the world,\u201d he said, adding that \u201conce inside the safe operating space, we would of course have to continue on a sustainable pathway.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Wider Image: Battling deforestation in the Amazon Burning forest is seen during \u201cOperation Green Wave\u201d conducted by agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, to combat illegal logging in Apui, in the southern region of the state of Amazonas, Brazil, August 4, 2017. Photograph: Bruno Kelly/Reuters\n\nRockstr\u00f6m said that he believes the disputing researchers have much more in common than their infighting would imply. \n \n\u201cWe are [all] working to safeguard biodiversity for sustainable development. We are [all] in the same camp. Complementing each other, they at the ecosystem level, us at the planetary level.\u201d\n \nBut Montoya and his group stand by their criticism and are working on a second paper responding to Rockstr\u00f6m and his team. \n \nWhile Montoya\u2019s paper does not critique the other eight planetary boundaries in their paper, Montoya told me that each of the boundaries \u2013 even the physical ones \u2013 have faced \u201ca lot of controversy.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey all suffer from the tipping-point problem,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich we argue promotes a business-as-usual ethos and distracts us from taking the action that is urgently needed.\u201d\n In many ways one could argue that the planetary boundary is an easy and simple way to explain environmental impacts to world leaders \u2013 few of whom have any education on ecology or the environment \u2013 and the public. \n But Montoya argues that the planetary boundaries concept is doing more harm than good. \n \n\u201cPoor or ill-founded science ultimately brings about ineffectual policies at best \u2013 and potentially highly damaging ones \u2013 and erodes trust in scientists,\u201d he said. \n And this can have real world impacts: Montoya and colleagues point to forest policy in Europe as one example. \n \n\u201cThe assumption that there is a critical biodiversity level below which forest functioning will collapse prompted managers [to] plant resilient tree species to climate change, pests, and disease,\u201d Montoya explained, adding, \u201cthis was recommended to avoid reaching a tipping point in forest service provisioning, primarily timber production.\u201d But the recommendations have resulted in endangered old growth forests and native species, according to Montoya. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA man offers for sale a wounded common buzzard (buteo buteo) in a national road near the village of Thumane on November 8, 2017.

How we communicate environmental crises \u2013 and the accuracy of the science that underpins that communication \u2013 proves more important with every passing year, as the world walks into climate and ecological uncertainty. \n \nYes, life itself survived the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event \u2013 but most species did not. Believe me, humans probably wouldn\u2019t have survived the tens-of-millions of years that followed the Great Dying: oxygen levels were dangerously low, food would have been scarce, and the world would have looked largely barren and wasted even as some species and ecosystems managed to survive. Outside the moral dilemma of extinction, there is no question that if humans push more-and-more species into oblivion there will be impacts on our society \u2013 and they could become catastrophic. \n Humans evolved 248 million years later in an Earth that was far more biodiverse and rich, a kind of Eden of abundance and diversity.

Now, a new study--building on a smaller but growing body of research in the workplace--supports the power of forgiveness to potentially improve well-being and productivity in professional settings.\nConflict among colleagues is inevitable, and--left unheeded--associated with significant stress, health problems (both mental and physical), and poor productivity. Researchers set out to explore the role of forgiveness in ameliorating these negative impacts.\nThe participants--more than 200 employees working in office jobs in Washington, DC, or manufacturing jobs in the Midwest--responded to questionnaires about their levels of forgiveness, productivity, and well-being. \n\nThe first survey asked respondents to focus on a specific offense, and how they believed it affected them. The second study looked at participants' general tendency to be forgiving and their general state of mind and work habits over the previous month.\nIn both cases, forgiveness was linked to increased productivity, decreased absenteeism (fewer days missing work), and fewer mental and physical health problems, such as sadness and headaches. In the second study, these benefits were partly explained by reductions in interpersonal stress that went along with a forgiving disposition.\nThis new research is important to employees and employers alike, as a lack of forgiveness negatively affects the individuals involved and organizations as a whole. Holding on to negative feelings after a conflict may lead to disengagement at work, a lack of collaboration, and aggressive behavior. Carrying a grudge is also associated with increased stress and a host of negative emotions, including anger, hostility, and vengeful rumination. \nSince many people who have been in conflict need to continue to work together, forgiveness can be an effective coping tool, and a way to repair relationships and restore trust--both of which are key to effective work cultures.\nMore evidence of the power of forgiveness\nIn 2012, my team at Courageous Leadership LLC worked with employees at Google to build a more courageous culture, including the courage to forgive (one of the keys to healthy ongoing work relationships). We had employees share times when they failed to act on their values at work, to admit they didn't understand something, or to speak up when they thought they had a better idea. This was designed to remind everyone how easy it is to act outside of our values in stressful situations--to do something that might merit forgiveness.\nParticipants then practiced taking courageous action. We had them use the REACH model (developed by Everett L. Worthington, one of the coauthors of the new workplace study) to practice forgiveness by identifying current grudges and work on forgiving (not condoning) the behavior. Participants also remembered and shared when others had forgiven them.\nOur program also showed positive impact. Participants reported a greater understanding of the power of stressful situations to negatively affect behavior. They also reported feeling better and more connected afterward; as one noted: \"I had a deepened sense of lightening inside, like letting go of heavy weights. I feel the forgiveness exercise for me was very powerful.\" Participants also took more social risks, like offering new ideas, admitting fears or concerns, and asking for or offering help.\nResearch shows that this kind of forgiveness can even impact employees who aren't involved in the conflict. When people see others practicing forgiveness (and other virtuous behaviors) at work, it often fosters positive emotions that can improve decision-making, cognitive functioning, and the quality of relationships.\nHow to foster forgiveness at work\n Unresolved stress from interpersonal conflict often dampens our cognitive and compassionate capacities, making it hard to find a way to forgive. Drawing on the implications of their study, the researchers offer individuals and organizations some suggestions to foster forgiveness at work: \nModel forgiveness at work, particularly if you're a leader. Leaders' behavior often has the greatest impact on organizational culture, a kind of contagion effect. Leaders who model forgiveness on a regular basis are cueing similar behavior in others.\nApologize and attempt to make restitutions. If we don't take responsibility for our mistakes, distrust grows and the fear of something happening again can be worse than the original incident.\nRebuild trust by working on a common task, creating new experiences and memories of cooperation.\nConduct interventions (sometimes best done by third parties) to address conflict and foster forgiveness. Invest in programs to build understanding and teach evidence-based tools for ongoing forgiveness in the workplace.\nThere's an old saying (attributed to everyone from the Buddha to Carrie Fisher) that goes, \"Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.\" If you're holding onto a grudge at work, you could be sharing the poison with your colleagues. \nForgiveness, of course, does not mean we condone or ignore bad behavior. Every workplace should have policies and procedures for dealing quickly with serious transgressions. However, if you do feel ready and the situation warrants it, give forgiveness a try. It could help you, your colleagues, and your workplace."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article reports on new research studies, describing participants, survey methods, and findings linking forgiveness to productivity, absenteeism, and health \u2014 indicating it covers scientific research."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_science_to_scientific_4"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "1379.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["A huge international study of gun control finds strong evidence that it actually works"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Does gun control help reduce gun deaths? It's a crucially important question in light of the horrible news out of Texas, but even for PhDs, it's a tough one. There's been a mountain of research on the subject, but these dozens of studies conducted over many years and in many different countries reach a broad and sometimes contradictory range of conclusions. It's hard to know what it really tells us, taken together, about whether gun laws can reduce gun violence.\nA 2016 study, published in the academic journal Epidemiologic Reviews, seeks to resolve this problem. It systematically reviewed the evidence from around the world on gun laws and gun violence, looking to see if the best studies come to similar conclusions. It was the first such study to look at the international research in this way.\nThe authors are careful to note that their findings do not conclusively prove that gun restrictions reduce gun deaths. However, they did find a compelling trend whereby new restrictions on gun purchasing and ownership tended to be followed by a decline in gun deaths.\n\"Across countries, instead of seeing an increase in the homicide rate, we saw a reduction,\" Julian Santaella-Tenorio, a doctoral student in epidemiology at Columbia University and the study's lead author, told me in an interview shortly after publication.\nWhat the study found\n\nGuns collected during Australia's 1996 buyback.\n\nSantaella-Tenorio's study (co-authored with Columbia professors Magdalena Cerd\u00e1 and Sandro Galea, as well as the University of North Carolina's Andr\u00e9s Villaveces) examined roughly 130 studies that had been conducted in 10 different countries. Each of those 130 studies had looked at some specific change in gun laws and its effect on homicide and/or suicide rates. Most of them looked at law changes in the developed world, such as the US, Australia, and Austria, while a few looked at gun laws in developing countries, specifically Brazil and South Africa.\nThis isn't, then, a study that compiled its own original data on one specific gun law. It's actually more valuable than that: It's telling us what all the different studies on individual laws say when you examine them put together.\nSo what do Santaella-Tenorio et al. conclude? First, and most importantly, that gun violence declined after countries pass a raft of gun laws at the same time: \"The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths,\" the study finds.\nThis finding doesn't highlight one specific law, like an assault weapon ban, in isolation. There were \"so many different kinds of laws,\" Santaella-Tenorio told me, that it was hard to make good international comparisons on every specific kind of gun restriction.\nRather, countries passed big packages of gun laws, which overhauled the nation's firearm code fairly broadly, which all tended to share similar features. According to Santaella-Tenorio, they generally included:\nBanning powerful weapons, like automatic rifles.\nImplementing a background check system.\nRequiring people to get permits and licenses before buying a gun.\nSouth Africa's comprehensive Firearm Control Act, passed in 2000, contained all these measures. One study found that firearm homicides in five major South African cities decreased by 13.6 percent per year for the next five years.\n\"Reductions in nonfirearm homicides were also observed,\" Santaella-Tenorio et al. note, \"although not as pronounced as the ones observed for firearm homicides.\"\nAustria's 1997 firearm law, similarly, required background checks, limited access to powerful firearms, and imposed rules about how gun owners had to store their guns. Santaella-Tenorio reviewed two studies on Austria's 1997 law, both of which found evidence that the law had reduced deaths. According to one of them, firearm homicides went down by 4.8 percent, while suicides went down by 9.9 percent.\nAustralia's 1996 National Firearms Agreement (which outright confiscated 650,000 guns, in addition to imposing background checks and licensing rules) is perhaps the best-studied of any of the international laws. Santaella-Tenorio et al. reviewed eight studies on it, most of which found clear and strong evidence of a reduction in firearm deaths after the law's passage.\nOne study, for example, compared the Australian state of Victoria to others around the country. Victoria had passed a raft of firearm restrictions in 1988, so the NFA didn't change policy there that much. But firearm deaths went down countrywide by an average of 14 percent in other states relative to Victoria, suggesting that the NFA provisions specifically had made the difference.\nSantaella-Tenorio and his co-authors also found evidence that specific laws, such as background checks and rules on storage, reduced specific kinds of gun deaths.\n\"Laws restricting the purchase of (e.g., background checks) and access to (e.g., safer storage) firearms,\" they write, \"are also associated with lower rates of intimate partner homicides and firearm unintentional deaths in children, respectively.\"\nWhat they learned about guns in America\n\n(Shutterstock)\n\nSantaella-Tenorio and his colleagues looked at a number of studies on gun control in the United States as part of their overall review. There was strong evidence that that restricting access to guns tends to reduce gun deaths.\nOne study, for example, looked at Missouri's 2007 repeal of its law requiring a permit to purchase a firearm, which in effect repealed the state's background check requirement. This study found that after 2007, Missouri's homicide rate jumped by 25 percent. No other changes in law or circumstance appear to be able to explain the increase.\nBy contrast, laws favored by the National Rifle Association (such as concealed carry or stand your ground), when implemented, either had no effect on gun deaths or increased gun violence. And Santaella-Tenorio found this by considering not just studies that reached this conclusion, but also studies that supported loosening gun laws.\nMost of the studies that supported these laws were written by a handful of authors, like Florida State's Gary Kleck and Fox News columnist John Lott. Scholars who reexamined their conclusions, sometimes even using their own data, generally came to the opposite results.\nFor instance, a study by Lott and the University of Georgia's David Mustard found that laws permitting concealed carry reduced homicides in states and counties that passed them. However, a subsequent study that reexamined the same data found no effect, and that Lott and Mustard had used flawed statistical procedures in examining the data.\nAnother Lott study found that castle doctrine laws \u2014 laws that eliminate the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force, but only in your home \u2014 reduced homicides by 9 percent. But a second study came to the opposite conclusion, finding an uptick in homicides after states passed such laws.\nA third study looking at stand-your-ground laws \u2014 which go beyond castle doctrine in eliminating retreat duties outside the home as well \u2014 also found an uptick in deaths. Santaella-Tenorio and his coauthors summarize: \"Stand your ground laws were associated with a 6.8% increase in homicide rates, mainly driven by increments (14.7%) in homicide rates among white males.\"\nThe point, then, is that the pro-gun studies tended to be outliers in the literature, and were not supported by the most rigorous available analysis.\n\"Our goal was just to see what was out there, and identify the quality of the studies,\" Santaella-Tenorio told me. \"We eventually found that many others had used Lott's data, and they have found different results after adjusting for other variables, or using more years of data, or using different models.\"\nThis isn't conclusive, but it's powerful evidence\n\nRyan Houston/Moment/Getty Images\n\nIn our conversation, Santaella-Tenorio was insistent that he and his colleagues have not \"proven\" that gun laws reduce violence. The data, he says, is simply too complicated, and the analyses too primitive, to come to such a hard conclusion.\n\"It's really hard. In epidemiological studies \u2014 for example, pharmaceutical ones \u2014 you can randomly select your groups, and then have one group exposed to the pill and the other group not exposed,\" he says. \"However, in policy studies ... you can't have some states be exposed to legislation and other states not.\"\nThis helps explain some unusual results. For instance, some data from Quebec found that a Canadian law reducing access to firearms led to an increase in suicides by hanging \u2014 a large enough increase to offset the decline in suicides by firearm that followed the law. Other studies, from Australia and New Zealand, found a similar substitution effect.\nHowever, there is very good evidence \u2014 some of it from the same countries \u2014 that reducing access to guns reduces overall suicides. Indeed, Santaella-Tenorio himself believes that despite those three studies, limiting access to guns is very likely to reduce suicide rates overall.\n\"There's some other evidence that we didn't include in this review,\" he says, that finds attempting suicide is an impulsive decision that people regret (if they fail) and thus don't repeat. Firearms, because they're much more effective than taking pills or slashing your wrists, don't give people that option. Thus, reducing access to guns should (and empirically generally does) reduce the overall suicide rate.\nThis illustrates, then, that the findings in this study don't end the academic debate over guns. It's limited by study design \u2014 it only reviewed studies on firearm policy changes, not firearm ownership in general \u2014 and the inherent limitations in studying the effect of complicated public policy issues.\nNonetheless, this is a very important contribution to the gun debate. About 130 studies, from 10 different countries, converged on the idea gun deaths declined after laws restricting access to firearms went into force.\nWhile it's not conclusive, it is very, very suggestive."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article summarizes and discusses a 2016 peer\u2011reviewed systematic review of roughly 130 studies on gun laws and violence, including methodology, authors, and findings \u2014 clearly reporting on scientific research."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_science_to_scientific_5"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "6.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Cancer treatment for MS hailed"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Media playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionBBC team follows MS patient Steven Storey's progress after the new treatment\nUK doctors in Sheffield say patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are showing \"remarkable\" improvements after receiving a treatment usually used for cancer.\nAbout 20 patients have received bone marrow transplants using their own stem cells.

Prof Snowden added: \"It's clear we have made a big impact on patients' lives, which is gratifying.\"\nMultiple sclerosis\nIn MS the protective layer surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord - known as myelin - becomes damaged. The immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin, causing scarring or sclerosis.\nThe damaged myelin disrupts the nerve signals - rather like the short circuit caused by a frayed electrical cable. If the process of inflammation and scarring is not treated then eventually the condition can cause permanent neurodegeneration. \nThe BBC's Panorama programme was given exclusive access to several patients who have undergone the stem cell transplant. \nSteven Storey was diagnosed with MS in 2013 and, within a year, went from being an able-bodied athlete to needing a wheelchair and losing sensation in much of his body. \nHe said: \"I went from running marathons to needing 24-hour acute care.

This is not a technology you can patent and we have achieved this without industry backing.\"\nA study published last year involving MS patients in Chicago showed significant reductions in neurological disability, and for some the improvements persisted for at least four years, although there was no comparative control group.\nThe outcome of the more detailed MIST trial - which will report in a couple of years - could determine whether the stem cell transplant becomes a standard NHS treatment for many MS patients. \nDr Emma Gray, head of clinical trials at UK's MS Society , said: \"Ongoing research suggests stem cell treatments such as HSCT could offer hope, and it's clear that in the cases highlighted by Panorama they've had a life-changing impact. \n\"However, trials have found that while HSCT may be able to stabilise or improve disability in some people with MS it may not be effective for all types of the condition.\" \nDr Gray said people should be aware it was an \"aggressive treatment that comes with significant risks\", but called for more research into HSCT so there could be greater understanding of its safety and long term effectiveness.\n\nMedia caption Fergus Walsh reports on the cancer treatment which is 'rebooting' the immune system of MS patients like Steven Storey\n\nPanorama is broadcast on BBC One at 20:30 on Monday 18 January 2016."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article reports on a medical treatment (autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant) for multiple sclerosis, describes its mechanism, patient outcomes and quotes clinicians\u2014i.e., coverage of clinical research/medical findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_science_to_scientific_6"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "485.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Who's right about this radical plan to cool the planet?"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Some scientists want to geoengineer the atmosphere by mimicking volcanic eruptions, but others worry about unintended consequences.\nby Brad Jones, Futurism / Nov.16.2017 / 7:03 PM ET\n\n\n\n\nPrimary school children play outside their classroom as Mount Sinabung, active since 2010, erupts in the distance in Naman Teran Village, Karo, North Sumatra, Indonesia on Nov. 13, 2017.Albert Damanik / Reuters\nGet the Mach newsletter.\nIn brief: Some have suggested solar geoengineering \u2014 the injection of aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from the planet \u2014 as a way to counter global warming. However, new research suggests the radical process could do as much harm as good.\nSolar Geoengineering\nA new report suggests that geoengineering \u2014 intentionally manipulating the climate on a large scale to combat the effects of global warming \u2014 might have its own ruinous effect on the planet. Research led by scientists at the University of Exeter indicates that targeted solar geoengineering in one hemisphere might have a negative impact on conditions in the other hemisphere. Their research has been published in Nature Communications.\nThe idea of solar geoengineering is fairly straightforward. By injecting aerosols into the atmosphere, we could reflect sunlight away from the planet, thereby cooling its surface. This would mimic the effect of aerosols that are naturally emitted into the atmosphere following a volcanic eruption.\nDrones are fighting wildfires in some very surprising ways\nFor their research, the University of Exeter scientists conducted advanced simulations using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model.\nTheir results suggest that injecting aerosols into the Northern Hemisphere would decrease the number of tropical cyclones found in the North Atlantic. However, carrying out the same process in the Southern Hemisphere would increase the rate of these events. Furthermore, an effort to reduce the amount of cyclones in the North Atlantic could prompt droughts in the Sahel, a region in Africa.\n\u201cOur results confirm that regional solar geoengineering is a highly risky strategy which could simultaneously benefit one region to the detriment of another,\u201d said Anthony Jones, lead author of the paper, in a university news release. \u201cIt is vital that policymakers take solar geoengineering seriously and act swiftly to install effective regulation.\u201d\nCalculated Risk\nNot all scientists share Jones\u2019 reservations about solar geoengineering, however. Ken Caldeira is a climate scientist in the Carnegie Institution for Science, and he believes that the procedure is relatively innocuous based on the underlying science alone.\n\u201cIf you really trusted the models\u2026and were just worried about the physical climate systems and not about the social and political ramifications, you would just go ahead and do it,\u201d Caldeira told Futurism. \u201cThe reasons you wouldn\u2019t do it are you\u2019re concerned about the social and political ramifications, you\u2019re afraid that the models might be missing something important, or both.\u201d\nAccording to Caldeira, if geoengineering were interpreted as a kind of magic bullet that could provide a quick fix for global warming, humanity would have even less reason to change its behavior. It\u2019s a method of counteracting certain effects, but it\u2019s not a means of addressing the underlying issues.\nDennis L. Hartmann, a professor in the University of Washington\u2019s department of atmospheric sciences, further emphasized the fact that geoengineering is far from a quick fix for climate change.\n\u201cSolar radiation management would have to be sustained and increased to offset increased greenhouse gas warming,\u201d he told Futurism. \u201cIf the solar radiation management is halted for any reason, then a rapid warming would result, with likely catastrophic consequences.\u201d\nAccording to Caldeira, solar geoengineering alone is unlikely to have a disastrous effect on the planet. If we were to ramp up to the amount of material introduced to the atmosphere when Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991 by 2100, we could likely offset projected levels of global warming for this century, he said, noting that that eruption didn\u2019t cause climate chaos.\nStill, the best course of action is taking stock of how human activity is affecting our environment and making some much-needed changes\u2014 a process that will be neither quick nor easy.\n\"There's a Radical Plan to Artificially Cool the Planet by Mimicking Volcanic Eruptions\" was originally published by Futurism, LLC on Nov. 16, 2017 by Brad Jones.

Among the more than 600,000 people who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh, many are survivors of rape, gang rape and sexual slavery.\nHow many? Pramila Patten, the United Nations special representative on sexual violence in conflict, reports that every woman she encountered during her November visit to Bangladesh had either witnessed or endured brutal sexual assault. Their stories are harrowing. One 15-year-old girl was ruthlessly dragged on the ground for over 50 feet, tied to a tree and then raped by 10 Burmese soldiers. Patten has urged the U.N. Security Council to take action.\nTo be sure, the rape of Rohingya women is a gross violation of human rights. But why should the Security Council \u2014 charged with maintaining international peace and security \u2014 address sexual violence?\nBecause sexual violence in conflict is not simply a human rights issue \u2014 it\u2019s also a security challenge, according to a significant body of social science research, which we highlight in our recent Council on Foreign Relations report. What\u2019s more, widespread rape in wartime can be prevented. Here are five key insights into how this works.\n1. Sexual violence is often a symptom of military weakness.\nSexual violence committed by troops can signal weak command and troop discipline, which makes military units less effective in their mission. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a mass rape of more than 150 civilians in 2011 was attributed to local armed forces\u2019 lax command and control structures. When state forces regularly commit sexual violence, the command hierarchy may simply be too weak to enforce a policy forbidding this crime \u2014 and therefore may be ineffective in maintaining peace once a conflict is resolved.\nIn other cases, armed groups that recruit through abduction command those troops to rape in order to build solidarity among them. These groups have lower levels of unit cohesion and effectiveness than groups that rely on volunteers. A review of 91 civil wars, for example, found that groups that recruit by force committed significantly higher levels of rape against civilians, in an attempt to build social bonds through rape.\nWhile groups or individuals commit sexual violence in conflict for any number of reasons, when it happens there are strategic implications. Research shows that military units and law enforcement bodies that respect human rights and prevent sexual violence are more effective at promoting security.\n2. Sexual violence can increase the flow of refugees.\nWhen armed groups commit sexual violence, more people flee \u2014 making the region less stable. As we can see from the staggering number of Rohingya refugees, wartime rape forces people from their homes, depriving them and their families of their livelihoods, property and access to health services and education, destabilizing communities. Sexual violence has increased displacement around the world, from Guatemala to Iraq to Syria, where reports suggest that the danger of rape is a primary reason people flee cities under siege.\n\n Rohingya women cry while watching a graphic video of the Tula Toli massacre in their home in Thaingkhali Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh in December. (Allison Joyce for The Washington Post) \n3. Unchecked sexual violence can undermine trust in the state.\nConflict-related sexual violence signals a government\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens. That\u2019s particularly true when, as in South Sudan, the military commits this crime widely and with impunity. The lower citizens\u2019 level of trust in the state, the more difficult it becomes for a government to undertake economic, social or political reforms, which undermines stability.\n4. Countries with widespread sexual violence incur high financial costs.\nWartime rape is costly in ways that undermine national stability. Victims of sexual violence may suffer long-term physical and psychological aftereffects, which impose high costs of care, reduced economic productivity and lost income. In the DRC, for instance, agricultural output decreased partly because women were afraid to return to working in the fields.\nFurther, some evidence suggests that sexual violence during wartime continues as gender-based violence in peacetime, leaving behind still more costs long after the conflict has ceased. In Burma, neighboring governments are bearing the burden of these costs, with the support of humanitarian agencies that provide services to Rohingya refugees.\n5. Sexual violence can undermine reconciliation efforts after ethnic conflicts.\nParticularly when it\u2019s ethnically driven, sexual violence used as a tactic of war can make reconciliation much harder \u2014 including any efforts the Burmese government may pledge to pursue if the Rohingya return. Women raped by opposing parties are often stigmatized, treated as guilty by association with their perpetrators. Children born of rape frequently suffer discrimination, fostering tension in a community long after the conflict.\nRape in wartime corrodes future stability \u2014 but it is not inevitable. It\u2019s true that throughout history, many armies considered rape to be one of the legitimate spoils of war; this crime was tacitly accepted as unavoidable through the early 20th century.\nBut more recently, legal rulings have outlawed sexual violence and recognized it as a war crime. And research shows that while some conflicts include widespread sexual violence, not all do: One analysis of 177 armed groups in 21 African countries found that 59 percent were not reported to have committed sexual violence. Another analysis of 91 civil wars between 1980 and 2012 revealed that 17 percent did not include widespread sexual violence.\nIn other words, armed groups don\u2019t always rape with impunity; levels of sexual violence vary from one conflict to another. That\u2019s because while some leaders of armed organizations may order or tolerate rape by their soldiers, others prohibit it. That suggests that sexual violence in conflict can be prevented. Research has revealed best practices around the world, from community-based police reforms initiated in Nicaragua in the 1990s to innovative prosecutorial approaches recently instituted in the DRC.\nIt\u2019s possible, therefore, to drive down sexual violence in conflict \u2014 and evidence suggests that doing so matters to security and stability.\nJamille Bigio is a senior fellow for Women and Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The debate is how do we know what the ideal surface temperature is in 2100?\nPruitt\u2019s goal is to sow doubt on behalf of his oil industry allies in order to weaken and delay climate policies. Shifting the \u2018debate\u2019 toward \u2018the ideal surface temperature\u2019 achieves that goal by creating the perception that we don\u2019t know what temperature we should aim for. It\u2019s in line with his boss\u2019 recent ignorant tweet suggesting that \u201cPerhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming.\u201d \nI spoke with a number of climate scientists who agreed that to minimize the risks associated with rapid human-caused climate change, from a practical standpoint the \u2018ideal temperature\u2019 is as close to the current one as possible.\nTemperature isn\u2019t the issue - temperature change is\n\nStefan Rahmstorf, Head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research pointed out that we\u2019re not concerned about specific temperatures; it\u2019s rapid temperature changes that cause problems:\nPruitt of course is trying to have a strawman debate, distracting from the fact that not a certain temperature as such is better or worse, but that a change from what we are adapted to is a problem, especially a very rapid change - in either direction, cooling or warming, this causes big disruption. \nWe should not stray too far away from what we and the currently existing ecosystems have evolved for. That is the optimum, simply because it is what we\u2019re highly adapted to, and any major change is going to be very painful.\nCivilization developed in a stable climate\n\nTexas Tech\u2019s Katharine Hayhoe agreed, noting that human civilization has developed in the relatively stable climate of the past 10,000 years.\nThere is no one perfect temperature for the earth, but there is for us humans, and that\u2019s the temperature we\u2019ve had over the last few thousands of years when we built our civilization, agriculture, economy, and infrastructure. Global average temperature over the last few millennia has fluctuated by a few tenths of degrees; today, it\u2019s risen by nearly 1\u00b0C and counting.\nWhy do we care? Because we are perfectly adapted to our current conditions. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities are located within a metre of sea level. What happens when sea level rises a metre or more, as it\u2019s likely to this century? We can\u2019t pick up Shanghai or London or New York and move them. Most of our arable land is already carefully allocated and farmed. \n\nWhat happens when we can no longer grow the crops we used to, as climate shifts and water becomes more scarce in many subtropical areas? We can\u2019t just take over new land: someone else already owns it. What happens when our water resources diminish or even run out? We can\u2019t take over someone else\u2019s water rights without a war.\nWe care about a changing climate because it exacerbates the risks we face today, and threatens the resources we depend on for our future.\nIn fact, Hayhoe specifically answered this question in one of her \u2018Global Weirding\u2019 videos for PBS:\nThe Paris climate targets are appropriate\n\nMichael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State also pointed out that we\u2019re approaching some critical temperature thresholds. For example, his research has shown that at warmer temperatures, reproduction of malaria-transmitting parasites increases rapidly.\nThere are some absolute temperature thresholds that are important when it comes to agriculture (particularly in tropics), coral bleaching, infectious disease, and heat stress (e.g. the tropics becoming essentially unlivable).\nSo while it\u2019s difficult to say what the \u201cideal temperature\u201d is, there clearly is a range of temperatures suitable for human civilization and there is a real danger that we\u2019re pushing toward the upper limit of that range.\nNaomi Oreskes, Professor of the History of Science and Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard similarly noted that according to the peer-reviewed literature on climate change impacts, we\u2019re already headed into dangerous territory:\nOf course, there is no \u2018ideal\u2019 temperature so we should not accept that framing. We have strong scientific evidence that anything above 2\u00b0C is likely to be deeply problematic. Even the roughly 1\u00b0C change we have already seen is having measurable, adverse effects.\nThat\u2019s why with the Paris climate accords, every country in the world except the USA has agreed to try and limit global warming to no more than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, and preferably closer to 1.5\u00b0C. The targets would be even more aggressive if possible, but as Oreskes noted, we\u2019ve already caused 1\u00b0C of global warming, and transitioning away from fossil fuels will take time. From a practical standpoint, 2\u00b0C is the best we can plausibly achieve.\n\nIdeally, cut carbon pollution as quickly as possible\n\nWhen speaking with the scientific experts it quickly becomes clear that the ideal response to climate change involves a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. Global temperatures are already warming at a rate more than 20 times faster than Earth\u2019s fastest natural climate changes. It\u2019s that rapid rate of global warming that poses an existential threat. Species can only adapt so quickly. The longer we wait to slow that dangerously fast climate change, the worse the consequences will be.\nUnfortunately, the Trump Administration is doing everything it can to delay and weaken efforts to cut carbon pollution. Pruitt isn\u2019t interested in these scientific answers to his question; he\u2019s interested in helping his fossil fuel industry benefactors. He\u2019s one of Oreskes\u2019 Merchants of Doubt, but his time in power will be as finite as Donald Trump\u2019s.\n\n Topics"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.9", "GPT Reasoning: The article centers on climate science and includes expert scientists' explanations about temperature change, adaptation, and risks\u2014reporting scientific perspectives and findings rather than general politics or consumer advice."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_science_to_scientific_9"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "205.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["'Rainbow' dinosaur discovery: Tiny dino had colorful feathers"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["The fossilized remains of a tiny duck-sized dinosaur with rainbow feathers have been discovered.\nDubbed Caihong juji, which is Mandarin for \u2018rainbow with a big crest,\u2019 the dinosaur discovery was revealed in a paper published in the journal Nature Communications.\nThe dino, which had a bony crest on its head, likely sported iridescent feathers on its head, wings and tail, according to paleontologists.

The pigment in the feathers is black, but the shapes of the melanosomes that produce that pigment are what make the colors in hummingbird feathers that we see,\u201d said Eliason.\nThe dinosaur is the earliest-known animal with asymmetrical feathers \u2013 a feature that modern birds use for steering in flight. Caihong, however, couldn\u2019t fly \u2013 its feathers were probably used to attract mates and keep warm.\nXing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Science, who co-authored the study, notes that, unlike modern birds, who have asymmetrical feathers on their wingtips, Caihong\u2019s asymmetrical feathers were on its tail. \u201cThe tail feathers are asymmetrical but wing feathers not, a bizarre feature previously unknown among dinosaurs including birds,\u201d he said, in a statement. \u201cThis suggests that controlling [flight] might have been first evolved with tail feathers during some kind of aerial locomotion.\u201d\nThe bony crest on Caihong\u2019s head is also noteworthy when combined with its feathered features. \u201cThis combination of traits is rather unusual,\u201d said study co-author Julia Clarke of the University of Texas at Austin, in the statement. \u201cIt has a velociraptor-type skull on the body of this very avian, fully feathered, fluffy kind of form.\u201d\nThe international team that worked on the Caihong project was led by Dongyu Hu, a professor in the College of Paleontology at the Shenyang Normal University in China.\nCaihong is not the only dinosaur making headlines.

They're difficult to diagnose, and drugs struggle to get into the brain as the brain's blood supply is largely separate to the rest of the body. \nNot surprisingly, several companies have left this territory in recent years. Last week, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced it will stop research into developing drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, after costly failed attempts over the past decade.\nIn recent years some clinical trials involving potential dementia drugs have had disappointing setbacks. In 2012, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson halted development of the antibody drug bapineuzumab, after it failed in late-stage trials to treat patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.\n\nDespite last week's announcement, Pfizer's support of the UK's Dementia Discovery Fund, an initiative involving the government, major pharmaceutical companies, and Alzheimer's Research UK, may be where their money can make the most impact in this space. \nThe fund aims to boost dementia research investment by financing early-stage drug development projects. And other pharma companies, such as Eli Lilly, Biogen and Novartis have continued to pursue dementia drug development with modest but promising success to date.\nRead More\nSo what makes dementia such a difficult condition to treat with drugs, and is progress being made towards a treatment?\nWhy dementia is so hard to treat\nDespite the vast number of people affected globally, with an estimated 46.8 million people currently living with dementia, there is currently no cure. While current treatments manage symptoms (the latest drug to gain FDA approval was memantine, in 2003) they offer no prospect of recovery.\n\nPart of the difficulty in finding treatments for dementia stems from the fact it's not a single disease, but a complex health problem with more than 50 underlying causes. Dementia can be better thought of as an umbrella term describing a range of conditions that cause parts of the brain to deteriorate progressively.\nMost drug treatments currently in development have targeted the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, which accounts for about 60 to 70% of all cases.\nFinding a successful treatment for Alzheimer's faces two major hurdles: the first being we still don't know enough about the disease's underlying biology. For example, we don't know what exactly regulates the toxic build-up of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and tau tangles in the brain that are found in Alzheimer's patients, which specific types of these are toxic, or why the disease progresses at different rates in different people.\n\nIt doesn't help that symptoms of Alzheimer's develop gradually and slowly and a diagnosis might only be made years after the brain has started to undergo neurodegenerative changes. To boot, it's not uncommon for Alzheimer's to be present as well as other forms of dementia.\nThe second major hurdle to finding a treatment is that drugs need to first cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier provides a defence against disease-causing pathogens and toxins that may be present in our blood, and by design exists to keep out foreign substances from the brain. The downside is that it also keeps the vast majority of potential drug treatments from reaching the brain.\nPromising steps in the right direction\nCurrently available medications such as those which block the actions of an enzyme that destroys an important chemical messenger in the brain for memory (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) or blocks the toxic effects of another messenger, glutamate (memantine) temporarily manage symptoms. But new treatments are focused on slowing or reversing the disease process itself, by targeting the underlying biology.\n\nOne approach, called immunotherapy, involves creating antibodies that bind to abnormal developments in the brain (such as amyloid-\u03b2 or tau), and mark them for destruction by a range of mechanisms. Immunotherapy is experiencing a surge of interest and a number of clinical trials -- targeting both amyloid-\u03b2 and tau -- are currently underway.\nAducanumab, an antibody targeting amyloid-\u03b2, has shown promise in clinical trials and phase 3 trials are currently ongoing, as are several tau-based strategies. If any are successful, we would have a vaccine for Alzheimer's.\nIt's estimated only 0.1% of antibodies circulating in the bloodstream enter the brain -- this also includes the therapeutic antibodies currently used in clinical trials. An approach my team is taking is to use ultrasound to temporarily open the blood-brain barrier, which increases the uptake of Alzheimer's drugs or antibody fragments.\nSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\nWe've had success in mice, finding ultrasound can clear toxic tau protein clumps, and that combining ultrasound with an antibody fragment treatment is more effective than either treatment alone in removing tau and reducing Alzheimer's symptoms. The next challenge will be translating this success into human clinical trials.\nThe task of dementia drug development is no easy feat, and requires collaboration across government, industry and academia. In Australia, the National Dementia Network serves this purpose well. It's only through perseverance and continued investment in research that we'll one day have a treatment for dementia.\nJ\u00fcrgen G\u00f6tz is director of the Clem Jones Centre for Ageing Dementia Research at the University of Queensland.\nCopyright 2017 The Conversation.

Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\n (CNN)\nOn my first day back at work as a network news correspondent after my first child was born 11 years ago, a late assignment meant I arrived home long after my daughter had gone to bed.\nA few mornings later, the phone rang as I got ready for work. My boss said I needed to travel to Massachusetts to cover a story. I hung up and burst into tears.\nMy husband tried to make me feel better, saying I would be on the national news that evening, but all l could think about was being away from my daughter.\nMy re-entry to the work world was anything but easy and seamless. Before I gave birth, I thought I'd return to my hard-charging television correspondent role three months after delivery and pick up exactly where I left off.\n\nAnd then I held my baby and couldn't imagine leaving her for an hour to get a haircut, let alone 12 hours, which is the time I typically logged each day at work before I became a mom.\nRead More\nI struggled with a changing identity and balancing the demands of motherhood with the challenges of a network role. Why hadn't anyone told me how hard it was going to be -- or was it just me? So many other women seemed to be handling things much better.\nIf only I had known then that what I was going through was the \"fifth trimester,\" a term coined and trademarked by author Lauren Smith Brody, a former executive editor of Glamour magazine and a mother of two. \nWe mark pregnancy in three trimesters, and the \"fourth trimester\" is used to mean that time after delivery when your baby is adjusting to life outside the womb.\n\nLauren Smith Brody is author of \"The Fifth Trimester.\" \nThe \"fifth trimester\"? It's the time when new mothers, just months after delivery, are going back to work but often before they feel emotionally and physically ready to return, said Brody, author of the new book \"The Fifth Trimester: The Working Mom's Guide to Style, Success, Sanity, and Big Success After Baby.\" \nBrody considers the \"fifth trimester\" to be the first few months back at work, whether women return after a week or after six months of leave, whether they work in blue collar or white collar professions, whether they have paid leave, or are like the majority of Americans who work at companies that don't offer any paid leave. (The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not mandate paid maternity leave.) \n\"For the first three trimesters, you could fill bookshelves full with the number of books out there, and then the same actually when (my son) was born, there was the fourth trimester, which was a term that was new to me at the time,\" she said. She was helped along by books about re-creating the womb during those first months after her son was born.\n\"But then I got back to work, and I had this weird feeling of both, 'Oh, thank goodness, I know how to do this,' and then also, 'Oh, no, I really don't know how to do this with a baby,' and there were very few resources to help me ease back in and to help me manage my expectations of myself and not blame myself for it being such a struggle.\"\n\n\"The Fifth Trimester\" includes tips and advice for new mothers returning to work. \nBrody, whose sons are now 5 and 8, said she remembers feeling so harried when she returned to work that she didn't even take the time to look around to see whether any resources might be available for her. She realized later that she had undiagnosed postpartum anxiety after her first child was born.\n\"I hated that I wasn't what I expected of myself,\" she said. \"And that after all these years of achieving at work ... here I was with a baby, just absolutely incapacitated, and I was so thrown by that and so disappointed in myself.\"\n'Everybody talked about guilt'\nThe veteran women's magazine editor was open with her colleagues about her struggles in returning to work. As her sons got older, she found herself offering advice to women in the office who were starting families. And then, as she started thinking about what she might want to do next in her career, she wrote a memo of story ideas. The concept of promoting the \"fifth trimester\" was one of the ideas on her list.\n\n\"It was really, really eating at me,\" she said. \"I felt this sisterhood of mentorship and this working-mom mentor thing was really needed and real. And I knew that my experience alone is not enough to help everyone in the world, my God, definitely not. But if I could collect this huge breadth of experiences and put them all together and offer people that working-mom mentor that I didn't really feel like I had, that would be really valuable.\"\nShe put together a 50-question survey and sent it via email to people within her network, asking that they also share it socially and with their respective networks of family, friends and colleagues.\nShe hoped for 100 responses but ended up with more than 700, representing working women from every state in the country and from a range of professions, including police officers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, Fortune 500 executives, business owners, waitresses and freelancers. She followed up with more than 100 of the women, conducting in-depth interviews with them that help form the basis of her book.\n\n\"It was amazing to see the differences in their experiences, but what I actually found more remarkable was sort of the emotional through line of the things they had in common,\" Brody said. \"Everybody talked about guilt, even if it meant a different thing to each person. Everyone talked about coming back to work, feeling different and knowing that people saw them differently, no matter what field they were in.\"\nSeventy-five percent of the women Brody surveyed said they wished they had been able to take a longer maternity leave. When asked how much extra time they would want, the most common answer was \"a few more months,\" according to the book. This response tracks with what Brody heard from the women in terms of when they felt physically and emotionally back to normal after giving birth: The average respondent said they were physically back 5\u00bd months after delivery and emotionally back after almost six months.\nBrody interviewed women who returned to work a week after delivery and others who had six months of leave. \"Either way, there's a monumental transition,\" she said. \"I like to point out that the fifth trimester might be longer for some women and shorter for others. You kind of don't know how long that transition time is going to be until you're on the other side of it ... I will say that when women went back very, very early, they seemed to have lengthier transitions.\"\n\nBrody's survey is not scientific, she admits, but it does reflect some of the major stresses new mothers experience when they return to work. Even if a woman is able to take the three months of unpaid leave required in the United States under federal law in most cases (companies with fewer than 50 employees are exempt), she is still returning months before she feels emotionally and physically back -- and months before she is getting a decent night's sleep. The typical baby in Brody's survey was sleeping through the night at just over 7 months old.\nWhen you add in the stresses on a relationship, you've got what Brody aptly describes as a \"mess.\" Seventy-one percent of women said they battled more with their partners in the first three months after returning to work than they had ever before. It was the most stressful time in their relationship, they said, even more stressful than adjusting to a newborn or the first year of marriage.\n'What do I need right now?'\nSo what's a new working mother to do? Brody, who is a passionate advocate of paid leave, uses her book to focus less on what companies can and should do to help women with re-entry, and more on what women themselves can do. She provides tangible tips and helpful advice from women who have been there and who more than survived, they thrived. She covers such issues as \"how to win over any resentful colleagues\" and preparing for that first day back at work, which she calls the \"second cutting of the cord.\" \nShe encourages women to get their child care up and running slightly before the first day so they can try it out and adjust to leaving their loved one in the hands of someone else.\nShe's proudest of a chapter on the importance of emotional health titled \"On Feeling Human Again\" and says the simplest way to feel very good again is to ask, \"What do I need right now?\" Think about what you need -- at home and at work -- and ask for it, she said.\n\nAbout one in seven women will have a postpartum mood or anxiety disorder, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Her risk increases if she is facing any kind of extenuating circumstance, such as single motherhood, loss of a job or a big life transition, according to Brody. \nGoing back to work sooner than you are ready can be an extenuating circumstance, she believes. One study found that the risk of postpartum depression was higher in women who took maternity leaves of less than six months.\n\"This is a matter of moms feeling like, from the very beginning, they can ask for what they need,\" she said. \"If you don't ask for what you need, you will find yourself in a deeper and deeper hole to dig yourself out of.\"\nBrody has also created a business called The Fifth Trimester, which works with new parents and companies to create more family-friendly cultures in the workplace. In addition to working with companies on ways to invest in women once they come back from work, she spends a lot of the time in her workshops talking about those \"soft skills\" that can help new mothers get what they need, whether it's at work or at home.\nShe points to unique approaches some companies are taking, such as home furnishings firm Wayfair, where conversations begin about how employees want their jobs to transition even before they go on leave.\n\"They are so forward-thinking in this stuff, and they have just completely made it the norm that whenever someone is at the point where they announce a pregnancy or that their partner is going to have a baby, the conversation is completely opened up: 'How do you want your job to change and evolve?' \" Brody said. \" 'It is just an assumption that you're probably going to want to, so let's talk about it,' and then it becomes an opportunity, and this is something that I think a lot of companies of any size could do.\"\n\nShe also points to how women can feel good about their skill set when they are back at work. New mothers are much more decisive about what they say \"no\" to -- they are making calculations about what comes at the expense of time with their child.\n\"But the things you say 'yes' to, like that new project you're taking on, you are so committed to it, because you've done the math on it, you've done the kind of emotional math on it to figure out, 'what am I going to feel from what compromises I'm making in order to be able to really commit to this?' So when you do commit, like, you are all in, and I think that's an amazingly valuable approach that women have when they come back to work and quality that they have when they come back to work.\"\nAs more parents and companies start talking about the \"fifth trimester,\" Brody hopes people will come to understand that this transitional time exists and presents a host of challenges but also that women can get through it and come out stronger in every way.\n\"For me, I found that it was really helpful also to understand that the transition was finite and that when I got to the other side of it, I would actually see, really clearly see all of the ways in which I was a better editor, a better employee, a better manager and leader.\"\nFor any women who are adjusting to the return to work or who have gone through it, Brody hopes they'll be open about their experiences. She says she wants every woman to do what works for them emotionally but hopes they realize that the more open they are, the better off we'll all be.\nSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\"If you are just open about what is challenging in this transition, about the fact that it is probably too soon (to return to work) if you feel that way, but then also about the fact that look at this, you are still getting your job done ... and even the things you're struggling through, you're going to get through it, look back and see that you made it through and came out stronger,\" she said. \n\"I hope the book gives new moms the courage to be honest and open about the challenges of new working motherhood, so that even when you're struggling, you are doing a greater good by educating your workplace -- and shifting workplace culture for the better.\n\"More than anything, it's important to be transparent about the challenges but also about the triumphs. ... That will also help everyone be less afraid of it, both of going through it and managing people who are going through it.\"\nWhat do you think is the best way to help new moms when they return to work?

Pundits from across the political spectrum are suddenly wrestling with the question.\nDerek Thompson at the Atlantic started things off by suggesting there was a \"doom loop\u201d of liberalism \u2014 a widespread trend in Western nations that should cause significant concern: Education and feminism lower fertility, and so countries turn to immigration to make up the difference in the labor force. As the number of immigrants increases, it becomes harder to integrate them, which gives rise to blowback populism. \nRoss Douthat of the New York Times fired back, respectfully suggesting that secular liberal societies could incentivize fertility of native citizens by deploying some fairly minor policy tweaks, including bigger financial incentives for childbearing \u2014 and by promoting different family norms, like increased involvement in religious communities. \nAnd now Bryce Covert, writing from a feminist perspective, has written an op-ed for the Times that tackles the issue from a slightly different angle, arguing that the Trump administration\u2019s curtailment of access to free contraception could have serious, negative economic consequences as women shift from jobs to child-rearing.\nThe reality of declining fertility turns out to be quite complex. To begin with, it should be noted that while fertility declines in the 20th century were driven by a mix of improved contraception and declining desired fertility, 21st-century declines have occurred with virtually no correspondent decline in women's\u2019 desired number of children: Women in America continue to report wanting to have more children than they in fact have, and the number has not declined very much in this century; indeed, they desire well above replacement-level amounts of children.\nBut we don\u2019t make it easy for them to act on that desire. Far from a simple story of secular societies liberating women from the onerousness of child-bearing, declining fertility in post-industrial societies is also a story of disappointed hopes. (The story in developing countries is quite different.) The shortfall in fertility is growing. Now these \u201cmissing kids\u201d are becoming nearly as numerous as unintended births.\n\n\nHigher fertility would be good, but it\u2019s hard to achieve\nIf we take the expressed desires of American families seriously, and especially the desires of American women, then we need to find a way to help them achieve their goals. Financial incentives, it turns out, are not highly effective. Studies find that policies that encourage parental leave or offer financial subsidies to parents require lots of money for small fertility gains. Likewise, many conservatives wrongly believe that banning abortion or restricting contraceptives might boost fertility, but the best evidence suggests such restrictions have at best weak impacts, at least in developed countries.\nCultural forces, meanwhile, can be extremely powerful but are difficult to engineer, especially in big, culturally pluralistic societies like the United States. Douthat\u2019s preferred prescription (and my own), that people should be more religious, may have a very limited impact. Even societies with high religiosity, such as in Africa or much of Eastern Europe, have seen falling birth rates. This decline in religious countries (including where religiosity is stable or rising!) is surprising, because religious groups tend to place a high priority on family, children, and multi-generational living. But the fertility-suppressing forces of modern economies appear to be even more influential. \nIn a low population growth society, inequality is more easily entrenched, parental wealth more easily passed on to heirs, new startups are less able to expand rapidly, and declining generational cohort sizes reduce the need for certain classes of labor (child care and education most notably). The logic is not entirely intuitive, but a declining population means the employed share of the population must rise to maintain existing economic functions, and productivity per worker must rise to maintain output. Yet for more than a decade productivity growth in the developed world has been low and the employed population share has been stagnant or falling. \nA low population growth environment means the economic pie grows slower too \u2014 which means, in the long run, that wealth consolidates. And in the very long run, we miss out on potential Mozarts, Washingtons, and Edisons.\n\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be immigration versus fertility. Let\u2019s increase both.\nBoth Thompson and Douthat rightly see a threat in low population growth, but each focuses on just one side of the problem. Douthat, for example, would have us all have more babies to avoid the need for immigrants.\nBut so long as American values of pluralism, integration, and personal liberty persist, we will need immigrants to fill a vital role in our cultural milieu. Plus, boosting fertility is going to have to be a long-run play: In the short run, US population growth persistently undershoots forecasts. Even if you\u2019d prefer Douthat\u2019s approach, in the abstract, we need immigration to rise from its presently quite low levels to stave off short-run population strains. \nNo serious population growth agenda for America can lean on just fertility to accomplish its goals, at least not if it wants to avoid serious short-run economic crises and preserve traditional American values, which are inseparable from openness to immigrants.\nThompson, meanwhile \u2014 while arguing that integration of immigrants gets harder as births make up a smaller and smaller share of population growth \u2014 skips over the sources of those low birth rates. He devotes no time to considering whether, perhaps, we might benefit from making some political, economic, and cultural adjustments to empower women and families to have the kids they want to have. Given how dire his forecast is, it is genuinely perplexing that he basically ignores pro-natal policies. \nWhat we really need is a political movement in favor of population growth from all sources. We need policies that remove fiscal penalties for marriage and encourage marital stability, that recognize the service parents do for society, and that subsidize childbearing and child-rearing accordingly \u2014 even if, on their own, such policies won\u2019t restore us to stable fertility levels. We need new cultural norms that make our society more family-friendly. And we need cultural leaders to set an example, have kids, and promote childbearing and parenting. \nProposals for a pro-population growth agenda\nWhat kinds of policies might help? Replacing the estate tax with a per-heir \u201cinheritance\u201d tax would encourage wealthy people to have children and also to break up their estates, killing two birds with one stone. Expanding existing tax credits for children, and consolidating complex child tax provisions into one larger benefit, would help ease parents\u2019 budgets \u2014 even more so if refundability were expanded (or if credits came by monthly check). \nAnd we could get even more creative: Should rent control be adjusted for family size? Should bigger families get to cut in lines? Should minivans with car seats get special parking places akin to those for disabled people? Should families with at least four kids be given a public honor or award and a meeting with their senator or governor? Many countries have tried such social or cultural policies: Sometimes they have an effect, often they don\u2019t, but as part of a wide basket of political and social changes, they may be useful.\nHere\u2019s an idea that\u2019s even more out there. Since traditional agricultural societies enabled parents to \u201ccapture\u201d the economic rents of childbearing because families shared income, the economic returns to childbearing were large. This remains true in developing countries where family networks share incomes, including through migrant remittances, but it\u2019s not true in America. We can fix that. We could set a small payroll tax on each person, and allocate it to their parent (with exclusions for cases of abuse or neglect, of course). Such a \u201cparental dividend\u201d would alter the long-run financial calculation of parenting. \nWe might also consider higher Social Security payouts, in their retirement years, for people who had more children.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget \u201cpersonal\u201d policies. If getting ahead in your industry requires happy-hour drinks three nights a week, that\u2019s unfriendly to families and may be preventing your female colleagues from having the family they want. Check your childlessness privilege. If you never volunteer to babysit your friends\u2019 kids, but expect to benefit from their Social Security taxes, you\u2019re a societal free-rider.\nIf your social activities require your friends to get babysitters because your house isn\u2019t kid-friendly, then make your house kid-friendly. There\u2019s no way to legislate such behavior; that would be totalitarian. But we can each voluntarily change our behavior.\nMeanwhile, we need to continue our traditional American immigration policy, meaning an open hand to anyone who will work hard and integrate into American life. We should accept more immigrants, even as we stiffen requirements to learn English. We should accept more refugees, even as we prioritize pro-integration resettlement policies like requiring refugees to participate in native-majority, English-language-using social organizations.\nContra the Trump administration, we should expand the \u201cdiversity\u201d visa category massively, seeking immigrants from unusual locations who, the research suggests, integrate faster: But we should screen them for personality characteristics that indicate personal flexibility and preference for diversity, which the research also suggests boosts integration. \nMore babies, more immigrants, more integration. This will yield an America that is larger, stronger, richer, more diverse, and more American than ever. \nLyman Stone, a Vox columnist, is a regional population economics researcher who blogs at In a State of Migration.

Andelman colabora con CNN y escribe art\u00edculos para el diario estadounidense Usa Today. Escribi\u00f3 el libro A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today. Fue corresponsal extranjero del New York Times y corresponsal de CBS News en Par\u00eds. S\u00edguelo en Twitter como @DavidAndelman. Las opiniones expresadas en esta columna son exclusivas de su autor.\n(CNN) \u2014 Sin importar qui\u00e9n est\u00e9 en el despacho oval, hay demasiado en juego y el resultado potencial es demasiado horrible como para dejar el arsenal nuclear totalmente en manos de cualquier presidente, especialmente de Donald Trump, quien, de acuerdo con Joe Scarborough, de MSNBC, pregunt\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a: \"Si las tenemos, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no podemos usarlas?\".\nCuando era director de Inteligencia Nacional de Estados Unidos, James Clapper dijo a CNN: \"Me preocupa [su] acceso a los c\u00f3digos de lanzamiento de armas nucleares, si en un arranque de resentimiento decide hacer algo respecto a Kim Jong Un; en realidad se puede hacer muy poco para detenerlo\". Al parecer, el pueblo estadounidense comparte esta inquietud respecto al temperamento de Trump. En una encuesta\n que llev\u00f3 a cabo recientemente la Universidad de Quinnipiac, se determin\u00f3 que el 68% de los encuestados piensa que Trump no es equilibrado, a diferencia del 29% que piensa que s\u00ed lo es.\nComo Trump est\u00e1 pensando en perfeccionar el arsenal nuclear de Estados Unidos, evitar que su pulgar sea el \u00fanico que pueda presionar el bot\u00f3n nuclear es a\u00fan m\u00e1s urgente.\nEn pocas palabras, es aterrador que este presidente tenga el control total y absoluto del malet\u00edn nuclear. Una selecci\u00f3n cambiante de oficiales militares lleva el portafolio de aluminio de 20 kilos, contenido en un malet\u00edn de cuero, a donde quiera que el presidente vaya. Contiene los blancos nucleares que solo \u00e9l puede activar con el \"bizcocho\n\", una tarjetita que lleva consigo y que contiene los c\u00f3digos para lanzar todo o parte del arsenal estrat\u00e9gico estadounidense desde cualquier parte del mundo en la que el comandante en jefe se encuentre.\n\n(Cr\u00e9dito: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)\nCuando el presidente est\u00e1 en la Casa Blanca, el malet\u00edn est\u00e1 desactivado, ya que el presidente ordenar\u00eda la activaci\u00f3n de los c\u00f3digos de lanzamiento desde la Sala de Crisis, en donde siempre hay un comando completo: al menos seis personas en servicio las 24 horas, los siete d\u00edas, en cinco turnos diferentes\n. Con todo, si el presidente ordenara un ataque, tiene la autoridad definitiva aunque haya quienes se opongan.\nEl malet\u00edn nuclear fue producto de la presidencia de Kennedy: tras el desastre de bah\u00eda de Cochinos, el presidente pens\u00f3 que ser\u00eda \u00fatil tener un medio para tomar represalias r\u00e1pida y eficazmente en caso de que alguna potencia nuclear atacara a Estados Unidos. En esos d\u00edas, eso significaba la Uni\u00f3n Sovi\u00e9tica. Hoy, Vladimir Putin siempre est\u00e1 cerca de su propio malet\u00edn, el Cheget, sin importar en d\u00f3nde est\u00e9.\nDonald Trump tiene m\u00e1s de 900 ojivas nucleares, con una potencia equivalente a la de unas 17.000 bombas como la que se lanz\u00f3 sobre Hiroshima, a su disposici\u00f3n y totalmente accesibles a trav\u00e9s del malet\u00edn. Como dijo al New York Times Franklin C. Miller, un especialista nuclear que trabaj\u00f3 para el Departamento de Defensa de Estados Unidos durante 22 a\u00f1os\n, \"no hay veto una vez que el presidente ordena un ataque. El presidente y solo el presidente tiene la autoridad para ordenar el uso de armas nucleares\".\nSin embargo, la soluci\u00f3n a la cuesti\u00f3n de que una sola persona tenga todo este poder podr\u00eda estar al alcance. Como se report\u00f3 en el sitio web \nPol\u00edtico, el jefe de gabinete de la Casa Blanca, John Kelly, \"est\u00e1 implementando un sistema que se us\u00f3 en presidencias previas para limitar la competencia interna\u2026 y para tener la \u00faltima palabra respecto al material que pasa por el escritorio del presidente\".\nEn espec\u00edfico, el secretario de gabinete de la Casa Blanca, Rob Porter, \"revisar\u00e1 todos los documentos que pasen por el escritorio del Despacho Oval\", agreg\u00f3 Pol\u00edtico. Pero \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 nada m\u00e1s los documentos? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no tambi\u00e9n cada vez que el presidente mire de reojo el malet\u00edn nuclear o, Dios no lo quiera, ordene que se abra?\nNo cabe duda de que negarle al presidente el acceso al malet\u00edn ser\u00eda una infracci\u00f3n que ameritar\u00eda una corte marcial. La lealtad y la cordura de las personas elegidas para este trabajo entran en un nivel de seguridad especial llamado Yankee White\n. Pero \u00bfqu\u00e9 pasar\u00eda si el oficial militar que lo lleva insiste en avisarle a John Kelly antes de dejar que el presidente acceda a su contenido? \u00bfY si el presidente se niega?\nEs evidente que cualquier persona sensata huir\u00eda de inmediato con el malet\u00edn bajo el brazo. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tribunal lo condenar\u00eda? Pese a todo, hay una soluci\u00f3n.\nEl Congreso deber\u00eda, simplemente, promulgar una ley que disponga que el portador del malet\u00edn nuclear o cualquier miembro del personal de la Sala de Crisis de la Casa Blanca le avise inmediatamente a Kelly, al asesor de seguridad nacional, H. R. McMaster, o al secretario de Defensa, Jim Mattis, si Trump ordena que se abra el malet\u00edn.\nActualmente, ambos partidos respaldan un freno legislativo a una medida internacional potencialmente vol\u00e1til que Trump podr\u00eda optar por tomar: levantar, a su discreci\u00f3n, las sanciones sobre Rusia. Esa medida se aprob\u00f3 en ambas c\u00e1maras por una mayor\u00eda abrumadora, a prueba de vetos, as\u00ed que Trump est\u00e1 obligado a promulgarla. Una propuesta de ley respecto al malet\u00edn nuclear deber\u00eda tener el mismo apoyo abrumador.\nHace una d\u00e9cada, el entonces vicepresidente, Dick Cheney, advirti\u00f3 en ABC News que el presidente (que en ese entonces era George W. Bush) \"podr\u00eda lanzar un ataque devastador como el que el mundo nunca ha visto. No tiene que consultarlo con nadie. No tiene que llamar al Congreso; no tiene que consultar a los tribunales. Tiene esa autoridad por la naturaleza del mundo en el que vivimos. Es desafortunado, pero creo que somos perfectamente aptos para tomar las medidas con las que contamos\"."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The piece is an opinion/political column about presidential control of nuclear launch authority and public concerns about Trump.

The views expressed here are solely hers.\n (CNN)\nIt started as a story about Sh***y Media Men. But it became a story about Amazing Media Women. \nIn mid-October 2017, shortly after the news broke about Harvey Weinstein allegedly being a serial predator -- and #MeToo broke the silence surrounding a complicit culture wide open -- a spreadsheet began quietly circulating around young women journalists. The spreadsheet was called \"Sh***y Media Men\" and invited women to anonymously post names of men in media whose behavior put them in the category of sexual harassers, and in some cases, assaulters. The cells on the spreadsheet began to fill with names and more names, some highlighted darkly in red to highlight men who had been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. \n\nRachel Sklar\nAs the list circulated, it went less-quietly viral, and Buzzfeed's Doree Shafrir wrote about it a day after its inception, causing an outward hand-wringing on Twitter about the danger of such a list (to men, natch) and a private stampede in media-type inboxes as women tried to suss out a copy and men quietly emailed lady-friends to see if they could take a look, too. Pretty soon the spreadsheet was pulled, but the screenshots lived on.\nAs did the rumors. Companies began quiet investigations and a number of high-profile men in media were less-quietly terminated, while alongside them giants of media like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer were toppled amidst allegations of years of harassment and abuse of power. People began to reference the #MeToo movement as something that might be dangerously wielded against innocent men as opposed to a movement of women speaking publicly about their own experiences with harassment, and standing in solidarity with other victims. \n#MeToo isn't about attacking men, of course. That's the wrong way to look at it, and one that erroneously centers on the concerns and comfort of men. Even so, it surely implicates men -- especially sh***y ones! -- so, in a refreshing change from many feminist issues, more than just women are thinking about it. \nRead More\n\nReally, it was only a matter of time before Katie Roiphe got involved. Roiphe, who came to prominence in the 90s in an article (and book) denying the prevalence of date rape and continued as a purveyor of give-that-nice-dude-the-benefit-of-the-doubt-you-ladies-are-just-being-hysterical writing, had reliably inveighed against feminism over the years. In this one, she was contracted by Harper's to write about the Sh***y Media Men list.\nAnd this is where the Amazing Media Women come in. Like dominoes of sisterhood, the following happened in rapid succession: \n(1) n+1 editor Dayna Tortorici tweeted that she'd heard Harper's was planning to out the author of the list: \"It's come to my attention that a legacy print magazine is planning to publish a piece 'outing' the woman who started the Sh***y [sic] Media Men list. All I can say is: don't. The risk of doxxing is high. It's not the right thing to do.\" \n(2) Founder and publisher of the now-defunct-but-always-beloved The Toast, Nicole Cliffe, stepped up and urged Harper's to reconsider, and pledged to pay the fees for any writer who pulled their piece from the next Harper's issue in protest. Her inbox started to fill. \n(3) Megan Lynch, VP and Editorial Director of Ecco publishing, tweeted that her company had pulled an ad from the next issue of Harper's: \"You can all guess why.\" \n(4) The New York Times wrote about the matter under the headline \"A Feminist Twitter Campaign Targets Harper's Magazine and Katie Roiphe\" wherein it was reported that a fact-checker from Harper's \"contacted a person said to be a creator of the list and said the article identified her as someone widely believed to be one of the people behind it.\" Roiphe claimed that she'd had no plans to out the author and would never dream of doing so if she didn't want to be identified.\n(5) On Twitter, women began claiming to be the author of the list, standing up in a veritable \"I, Sh***y Media Men List-icus\" moment. \n(6) Somewhere amid the hubbub, New York Magazine's The Cut and its editor, Stella Bugbee, gave the green light to a new piece. \n(7) Wednesday night at 10:12 p.m., Bugbee published the piece by writer Moira Donegan. It was called: \"I Started the Media Men List.\" \n\nOvernight, Donegan has become a hero. Her name trended on Twitter. Her piece is now the most popular piece on the site. The New York Times updated its piece with a new headline leading with Donegan's name. Oh, and her account calls Roiphe's description of events into question to an eye-popping extent, since in Donegan's telling, the email from the fact-checker identified her as \"a woman widely believed to be one of the creators of the Sh***y [sic] Men in Media List.\"\nLike the sh***y men of media (obligatory disclaimer: #NotAllMediaMen!), Roiphe and Harper's have not come out looking good here. Here's who looks good: \n(1) Tortorici, who took a stand publicly against outing and sounded the alarm about doxxing (and offering to pay for an ad to fill the space if necessary);\n(2) Cliffe, who according to the New York Times, \"pledged\" to pay approximately $19,000 in writers' fees and according to Cliffe, has already paid them; \n(3) Lynch, who took a stand by pulling her company's ad and ended up on the right side of the story; \n(4) The women of media Twitter, from the women claiming authorship to the women yelling loudly to collectively comprise the NYT's \"Feminist Twitter Campaign\" to the women who pledged to kick in with Cliffe for the pulled articles to the women who kept Donegan's name under wraps for so long; \n(5) Stella Bugbee, for being an editor whom Moira Donegan could trust to stand behind her, and with her; \n(6) And, most importantly, Moira Donegan, for her brave and honest and clear-eyed article -- and for starting the spreadsheet in the first place, because she saw that media needed a safe space for women, and that no one was providing that, so she tried to fill in that gap. \n\nNotice how Katie Roiphe is not on this list. That so-called feminist \"hysteria\" that Roiphe decried only yesterday is looking particularly well-founded given Donegan's account of the fact-checker email (with receipts) and let's just say Roiphe's veracity in speaking to the NYT has been roundly called into question. \nBugbee put her finger on it on Twitter: \"Katie Roiphe built her entire career telling men what they wanted to hear. A tactic for success only when men hold the keys to publishing.\" Bugbee holds her own keys, and used them here. \nBut also, Bugbee posits that Roiphe miscalculated, thinking that her version would not be contradicted because Donegan wouldn't go public. That makes sense, and here's why: Roiphe isn't part of a sisterhood. And when you're part of a sisterhood, you know that your sisters will have your back. I can only imagine what it meant to Donegan over the past few days watching friends and friendly feminists stepping up publicly to support her, many with their money and their reputations. I can only imagine what it meant to her to have Bugbee step up as an editor she could trust. And I can only imagine what it meant to see that Roiphe quote in the New York Times and feel brave enough -- and supported enough -- to challenge it. With receipts. \nLate Thursday afternoon, Donegan tweeted: \"I'm so awed by and thankful for the amount of generosity, solidarity, and kindness that's been sent my way. Thank you\u2014really, it means more than you know.\"\n#MeToo is about women, standing up with and for other women, with the empathy of knowing exactly what they're talking about, because, well, them too. When I say I can only imagine how Donegan felt, it's because a decade (give or take) ago, I needed the Donegans, and the Bubgees, and the Cliffes, and the Torticis of the media world signaling that kind of solidarity. \nHeck, I still need that. Whisper networks are imperfect, and they don't protect everyone (if they did, there'd be no need for a Sh***y Media Men list, and Harvey Weinstein and Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer would have been gone long ago). But it is also an unfair burden to place on women -- the gross abuses #MeToo has shown in sharp relief require an institutional response. Which is good for men too -- as Donegan acknowledges in her article, her list was \"vulnerable to false accusations,\" which in addition to potentially implicating someone who has not, in fact, harassed or abused, also risks undermining the credibility of legitimate accusations. It also leaves room for threats of legal action, especially from deep-pocketed alleged perpetrators (case in point: the current President!) which has a chilling effect on speaking up. \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\nSo we come back around to women, left to fend for themselves when really they just want to work. With just whisper networks, the burden is on women to avoid and strategize rather than on systems and power structures to address and preclude. (This is perfectly expressed in a tweet by editor Hannah Giorgis: (sic) \"can't stop thinking about how many media dudes are having a perfectly normal thursday while the women around them deal with yet another wave of reminders that our safety matters less than their comfort.\") As Donegan writes,\"I had become so accustomed to hearing about open secrets, to men whose bad behavior was universally known & perpetually immune from consequence, that it seemed like no one in power cared about the women who were most vulnerable to it.\" \nWell, guess what -- these women in power cared.

But I\u2019ve also been thinking a bit about economics, taking advantage of psychological distance to ruminate on stuff that isn\u2019t closely connected to the news. And one of the areas I\u2019ve been chewing over goes back to my old stomping ground of economic geography.\nIn particular, I\u2019ve been trying to clarify my thoughts after reading Emily Badger\u2019s stimulating piece on how megacities seem to have less and less need for smaller cities. I found myself asking what might seem like an odd question: what, in the modern economy, are small cities even for? What purpose do they serve? And this question leads me to a chain of thought that\u2019s a bit different from Badger\u2019s, although not necessarily contradictory.\nOnce upon a time, it was obvious what towns and small cities did: they served as central places serving a mainly rural population engaged in agriculture and other natural resource-based activities. The rural population was dispersed because arable land and other resources were dispersed, and so you had lots of small cities dotting the landscape.\nOver time, however, agriculture has become ever less important as a share of the economy, and the rural population has correspondingly declined as a determinant of urban location. Nonetheless, many small cities survived and grew by becoming industrial centers, generally specialized in some cluster of industries held together by the Marshallian trinity of information exchange, specialized suppliers, and a pool of labor with specialized skills.\nWhat determined which industries a small city developed? In some cases particular features of the location and nearby resources were important, but often it was more or less random chance at first, then a sequence in which one industry created conditions that favored another.\nSo Rochester became a place where people knew about optics, presumably creating the preconditions for the rise of Eastman Kodak, and much later Xerox. This was typical of small industrial cities: even if what a city was doing in, say, 1970 seemed very different from what it was doing in 1880, there was usually a sort of chain of external economies creating the conditions that allowed the city to take advantage of particular new technological and market opportunities when they arose.\nObviously, this was a chancy process. Some localized industries created fertile ground for new industries to replace them; others presumably became dead ends. And while a big, diversified city can afford a lot of dead ends, a smaller city can\u2019t. Some small cities got lucky repeatedly, and grew big. Others didn\u2019t; and when a city starts out fairly small and specialized, over a long period there will be a substantial chance that it will lose enough coin flips that it effectively loses any reason to exist.\nI\u2019m not saying that there weren\u2019t patterns of success and failure. Small cities were and are more likely to fail if they have miserable winters, more likely to come up with new tricks if they\u2019re college towns and/or destinations for immigrants. Still, if you back up enough, it makes sense to think of urban destinies as a random process of wins and losses in which small cities face a relatively high likelihood of experiencing gambler\u2019s ruin.\nAgain, it was not always thus: once upon a time dispersed agriculture ensured that small cities serving rural hinterlands would survive. But for generations we have lived in an economy in which smaller cities have nothing going for them except historical luck, which eventually tends to run out.\nNotice, by the way, that globalization and all that isn\u2019t central to this story. If I\u2019m right, the conditions for small-city decline and fall have been building for a very long time, and we\u2019d be seeing much the same story \u2013 maybe more slowly \u2013 even without the growth of world trade.\nAre there policy implications from this diagnosis? Maybe. There are arguably social costs involved in letting small cities implode, so that there\u2019s a case for regional development policies that try to preserve their viability. But it\u2019s going to be an uphill struggle. In the modern economy, which has cut loose from the land, any particular small city exists only because of historical contingency that sooner or later loses its relevance.\nFollow me on Twitter (@PaulKrugman) and Facebook, and read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.9", "GPT Reasoning: The piece is an opinion/analysis about economic geography and the role of small cities, referencing ideas and a journalistic article rather than reporting on specific scientific studies, experiments, or research findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_science_to_non_scientific_10"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "1097.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Villanova Wildcats News, Photos, Stats, Rankings"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["#1Villanova\n (19-1) \n 1:00PM - Sunday, January 28 \n 1:00PM ET \n@\n\nMarquette\n (13-6) \nPOINTS PER GAME\n88.0\n83.1\nFIELD GOAL %\n50.98\n46.96\nREBOUNDS PER GAME\n35.5\n32.7\nASSISTS PER GAME\n17.6\n16.3\nSTEALS PER GAME\n7.3\n6.6\nTURNOVERS PER GAME\n10.6\n11.7\nBLOCKS PER GAME\n4.3\n4.2\nGalleries\nJan 20, 2018 Villanova at Connecticut \nJan 17, 2018 Villanova at Georgetown \nJan 13, 2018 Villanova at St. John \nDec 30, 2017 Villanova at Butler \nDec 27, 2017 Villanova at DePaul \nNational Polls\nVillanova\nWildcats\nView Full Rankings\nAP\n 1st\nCoaches Poll\n 1st\nConference Standings\nBig East Conference\nW\nL\nPCT\nCONF\n\nVillanova Wildcats\n 19 \n 1 \n 0.950 \n 6-1 \n\nXavier Musketeers\n 18 \n 3 \n 0.857 \n 6-2 \n\nCreighton Bluejays\n 16 \n 5 \n 0.762 \n 6-3 \n\nProvidence Friars\n 14 \n 7 \n 0.667 \n 5-3 \n\nSeton Hall Pirates\n 15 \n 5 \n 0.750 \n 4-3 \n\nMarquette Golden Eagles\n 13 \n 6 \n 0.684 \n 4-3 \n\nButler Bulldogs\n 14 \n 7 \n 0.667 \n 4-4 \n\nGeorgetown Hoyas\n 13 \n 6 \n 0.684 \n 3-5 \n\nDePaul Blue Demons\n 8 \n 11 \n 0.421 \n 1-6 \n\nSt. John's Red Storm\n 10 \n 11 \n 0.476 \n 0-9 \nView All Standings\nTeam Statistics\n Offense \n Defense \nPOINTS PER GAME\n88.0\n88.0\n74.3\nASSISTS PER GAME\n17.6\n17.6\n14.0\nFIELD GOAL %\n50.98\n50.98\n44.80\nWildcatsNCAAB Average\nView All Team Statistics\nREBOUNDS PER GAME\n33.3\n33.3\n35.1\nBLOCKS PER GAME\n2.9\n2.9\n3.3\nSTEALS PER GAME\n4.8\n4.8\n6.2\nWildcatsNCAAB Average\nView All Team Statistics\nTeam Leaders\n Offensive \n Defensive \nPOINTS\nJ.

College-educated women have been a big source of support for Mrs. Clinton. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nIt\u2019s probably the biggest demographic story of this election: Hillary Clinton has made big gains with well-educated whites, particularly women. And Donald J. Trump has continued recent Republican gains in winning over less educated whites, particularly men. As Nate Cohn wrote in an article last month, education has replaced the culture wars as the defining electoral divide.\nBut what exactly do we mean by \u201ceducated\u201d? Some Upshot readers, responding to the article, suggested it was about intelligence \u2014 that college-educated people can see through Mr. Trump because they\u2019re smart.\nYou must mean high I.Q. v. low I.Q. when you say \u2018college educated\u2019 v. working class. The truth is, we are talking about smart people against not-so-smart people. \u2014 Mike Barker of Arizona\nI wouldn\u2019t say that Hillary is \u201cstruggling\u201d with less educated voters. I think the issue is that the world is more complex than it has ever been, and these voters don\u2019t understand our legal system, our electoral system, journalism, trade issues, the deficit, taxation, the Fed, NATO, the U.N., cyber espionage, immigration, counterterrorism, nuclear policy, diplomacy, the Geneva Conventions or the Constitution. \u2014 Jch of NY\nThe I.Q. connection is purely speculative; no rigorous studies have been published to support it. Other readers warned against the temptation to stereotype, pointing to various explanations and showing how difficult it is to come to definitive conclusions about the education correlation.\nIt\u2019s About What You Learn\nThese days, the highly educated tend to be liberal. A Pew Research center study showed this growing connection among those with graduate degrees. Some readers said it had to do with what you learn at college: You become \u201ceducated.\u201d\nWhen I started university, I was taken aback by how much I didn\u2019t know. It was exhilarating. Postsecondary education develops intangibles like the ability to think critically, and I think this explains why non-college-educated audiences are so vulnerable to exploitation by a Pied Piper like Trump. \u2014 Aaron, Phoenix\nAnother reader highlighted the advantages of encountering different points of view on campus.\nHigher ed is where a lot of people from conservative families find out that there are other ways to look at the world than through narrow religious and political ideologies; where they learn to question authority and distinguish between fact and opinion; where they discover that there are many people different from them in myriad ways who also matter. \u2014 Katherine Bailey, Florida\nNo, It\u2019s About Credentials and Social Class\nWhat if you mostly goof off at college \u2014 beer pong at the fraternity instead of bearing down at the library \u2014 but manage to get a degree? You may not be \u201ceducated\u201d but you still have an edge in the job market: The degree can be a ticket to a good job and the good life. If you don\u2019t have that credential, you may feel left out and frustrated \u2014 and more willing to shake things up with Mr. Trump.\nThis election is divided along class lines. Why do we have such difficulty saying so?\nThe invocation of education as the prime delineating factor among the electorate is just another way to avoid saying the C-word. We\u2019re not really talking about education, after all. We\u2019re not talking about how well-read these people are, about their skills at differential calculus, or whether they can say snarky things at cocktail parties about the shoddy curation of the Tribeca Film Festival. No, we\u2019re talking about the resentment that poorer people feel toward the accredited classes.\u201d \u2014 Squidge Bailey, Brooklyn\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that income is not nearly as predictive of presidential preference in this election as education. Trump supporters are not as poor as a lot of people think. And at the highest levels of income, the rich are set to reverse a decades-long pattern and support a Democratic presidential candidate.\nOr, You\u2019re Learning the Wrong Things\nSeveral readers blamed left-wing bias on campus, particularly among professors \u2014 or as one reader, L\u2019Osservatore, put it, \u201cthe unquestioned control of collectivists and socialists on 95 percent of college campuses.\u201d\nWhen you have \u201csafe zones\u201d where ideas cannot be discussed and explored, you have indoctrination. Liberals have done all they can to dictate learning in America for over 40 years. \u2014 MRS Little Rock, Ark.\nWhy do the college-educated tend to vote Democrat? Simple. A young person entering any American college will take humanities courses in philosophy, literature, history, the social sciences, all taught by strongly left-leaning Democrats. It is impossible that they should emerge from this experience ideologically untouched.\nAll this I well know as a recently retired conservative academic of 40-plus years \u2014 the only Republican in a department of 22 professors.\u201d \u2014 Rob, N.C.\nStudies have shown that professors have in fact become more liberal, with faculty members in New England standing out as far more liberal than the rest. A group of professors, frustrated by this trend, has compiled a Heterodox Academy ranking of colleges based on ideological diversity.\nBut other readers, pointing to examples like the rejection by many Republicans of the science on climate change, said there was an \u201canti-intellectual\u201d strain in the modern G.O.P. (Political science aficionados will think back to the book  \u201cAnti-Intellectualism in American Life\u201d by Richard Hofstadter.)\nJane of Santa Rosa said, \u201cThis is why Donald Trump \u2014 and the G.O.P. by extension \u2014 \u2018love the poorly educated.\u2019 \u201d\nIn 2012, the Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum called President Obama \u201ca snob\u201d for urging students to pursue college.\nSantorum: Obama \"A Snob\" For Wanting Everyone To Go To College Video by tpmtv\nA reader, John of Los Angeles, said of conservative complaints of one-sidedness: \u201cAlternatively: Facts have a liberal bias.\u201d\nMaybe It\u2019s About Location\nThe clustering of like-minded people \u2014 the so-called Big Sort \u2014 has been underway for quite a while, but the effect on political preferences seems to be accelerating in this election.\nRegion plays a role. In 2012, President Obama won a fairly high percentage of the white working class in Wisconsin and Minnesota, states with a tradition of labor rights and Progressive values. He didn\u2019t do nearly as well with working-class whites in Southern states.\n\nTop States as Measured by Diplomas Hillary Clinton is favored to win each of these 15 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nEducated white voters are more likely to live in big cities or near them, areas that have had better job growth and that tend to lean liberal. The mostly liberal Northeast has the highest percentage of college graduates \u2014 you\u2019re more likely to be expected to go to college \u2014 and the populous Northeast megalopolis, for example, draws college graduates searching for jobs.\nCollege graduates from rural towns who move to a metropolitan area for work may have their views influenced by their new environment and social circles. It\u2019s also possible that their views and interests may prompt them to move, whether in search of cultural opportunities or like-minded people. The result is social polarization by place.\nWisconsin is a good state to look at to see the class divisions. Trump is more popular in the counties where people are less educated and more rural and small town. In Trump country, Wisconsin, there\u2019s resentment of the quality of schools in and around Madison and Milwaukee, yet they don\u2019t want to look at how their aggressive attack on teachers and public education has convinced teachers to flock to areas where they are respected and paid well. \u2014 Jcarpenter, Midwest\nLiving in a blue city in a solidly red state, I think there is a rural/urban dynamic that many are overlooking. It\u2019s less about educated vs. uneducated. A whole way of life, instead of fading quietly away, is going out with a bang. No one is putting their start-up next to the grain elevator in a town with one stoplight. \u2014 Jamie, Sioux Falls, S.D.\nI think educated people support Democrats because they have better employment opportunities over a lifetime, not because they read philosophy in college. If you live in the I-95 corridor, the communities show growth and opportunities for education. If you live in small towns in the industrial heartland, your employment opportunities are limited. \u2014 Mary Mac, New Jersey\nOr, About Rational Policy Preferences\nA reader, William Hayes of Houston, said, \u201cTrump promises jobs by rolling back globalization, which appeals to the undereducated, not because they\u2019re stupid, but because they believe decreasing globalization will help them get good jobs.\u201d\nThe \u201ceducational\u201d divide is a red herring. We are going to have to think long and hard about the best way to address wealth inequity in a post-manufacturing economy. \u2014 BLM, Niagara Falls\nWorking-class whites have more to lose from Clinton\u2019s preference for more free trade pacts and continued de facto open borders. It\u2019s really simple as that. \u2014 Chloe, New England\nWhat About Education and Tolerance?\nA reminder here that the education correlation is among whites only. Nonwhites may have other priorities in assessing Mr. Trump. A reader, Space Needle from Seattle, wondered if Trump supporters were \u201csimply angry about their perceived loss of power in a society growing increasingly diverse.\u201d An article in The Times today explores \u201cwhite anxiety that has fueled political tumult\u201d not just in the United States, but throughout the Western world.\nPerhaps the demographic factor is not so much one\u2019s college experience, but rather the level of exposure a person has to persons of different social, sexual and cultural backgrounds, education levels, wealth and ethnicity, i.e. diversity. \u2014 David, California\nI can\u2019t say what drives the divide in your areas, but in mine (South Alabama), it is almost always race. The only exception is religion. \u2014 Willard Douglas, Alabama\nSuburban and moderate white voters may be uncomfortable with more explicit appeals to racial, ethnic and religious resentment \u2014 and those who have the college credential would have less reason for scapegoating. Some studies have shown that education can increase tolerance, but there\u2019s also evidence suggesting the effect can be overstated when it comes to race.\nHow Age and Education Connect\nOne overlooked factor is Mr. Trump\u2019s success with older voters. He has polled much better among those over 65 than among millennials, perhaps because of his appeal to return America to perceived glory days.\nEd Kilgore of New York magazine said calling people \u201cwhite working class\u201d because they don\u2019t have a diploma can be misleading: \u201cIt is important to understand that a majority of today\u2019s seniors came of age at a time when a college education really was not necessary for most jobs \u2014 in many cases even management-track jobs.\u201d\nEducational attainment has been rising for decades. In the late 1960s, only about 10 percent of Americans had bachelor\u2019s degrees. Today, that number is almost 33 percent, and for whites, it is around 36 percent. People with degrees tend to be more reliable voters.\nThe trends are clear. Each year, educational attainment of the public is increasing, and that does not bode well for Republicans. \u2014 Tom, Midwest\nA Plea for Understanding\nTwo readers had advice for Democrats:\nAs a white male without a college degree, I think maybe you shouldn\u2019t make such sweeping generalizations about an entire group of people. This is why we liberals have a hard time making inroads with this group. \u2014 Brett Hudgins of Seattle\nPerhaps uneducated whites would be more open to the policies of the Democratic Party if they were approached with greater respect from the Left. Is anyone surprised that uneducated whites are unreceptive to individuals who castigate them as being inherently racist and incompetent? Would any reasonable person expect Latinos to view Trump favorably after he stereotyped them all as being rapists and criminals? \u2014 Addy, U.S.\nHave we missed any reasons that white Americans with college degrees are less likely to support Mr. Trump? Let us know in the comments.\nUpdate: A reader, DrJ. of Pa., adds a comment about the possible impact of religion. Mr. Trump is the overwhelming favorite of evangelical Christians:\n\u201cI think it\u2019s relevant that conservatives are by and large more religious, certainly more fundamentally religious, than liberals. But religious SCHOLARS are not so religious.\n\u201cIn religion, the open mind and love of scholarship leads one away from the path of the true believer. The desire to cling to tradition (and, I would say, superstition) leads these conservatives to be less likely to pursue education and scholarship.\u201d\nUpdate: It turns out that Mr. Trump himself has said that people are simply born smart (or not). He said he\u2019s a \u201cgene believer.\u201d\nDonald Trump: Eugenics? Video by Fascist Archives\nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

This, combined with evidence that the GOP\u2019s favorability has dropped, suggests that the Republicans are already in trouble for 2014 and maybe beyond. In the New York Times, Jeremy Peters suggests that the Republicans\u2019 hopes of a Senate majority are fading. In the New Republic, John Judis goes even further, suggesting that the Republicans are in their \u201clast days\u201d and \u201cdeath throes\u201d and that the party could be \u201ccripple(d)\u201d for \u201cnot just in the 2014 and 2016 elections, but for decades to come.\u201d\nWhoa. This is all too much, too soon. Let\u2019s take a broader look at public opinion and some recent history:\n1) There are warning signs for Obama. First, it isn\u2019t like the public approves of his handling of the budget negotiations either \u2014 in the new Post/ABC poll 53 percent disapprove, a slight but not statistically significant increase from two weeks ago. Second, Gallup\u2019s tracking polls suggest that his overall approval rating has declined. Rasmussen finds the same thing. (And don\u2019t start in about Gallup\u2019s accuracy in the presidential election; there is nothing wrong with their presidential approval numbers.) I am the last person to put much stock in a single poll. But we have two polls showing the same trend \u2014 on top of a third warning sign: perhaps the best predictor of presidential approval, evaluations of the economy, are in freefall. I am happy to state that we need more polling to identify whether there is any trend in presidential approval. But all of these pieces of data deserve more attention than they are getting.\n2) It may not matter that the public disapproves of Republicans more than Obama. One rejoinder to the above is that it only matters who the public blames the most. Ezra Klein writes:\nBut a two-party political system with first-past-the-post elections is a zero-sum affair.\nThat\u2019s true. But it matters a lot that low approval of Republicans is driven mostly by the well-documented split among Republicans. Thanks to Scott Clement of the Post\u2019s polling unit, I got some more detailed information about how approval breaks down among party lines. Assuming that the fraction of independents who lean Republican is what Gallup\u2019s data suggests, and assuming that Republican-leaning independents have attitudes similar to Republicans (a decent assumption), the Post\u2019s numbers suggest this: if Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in the electorate approved of congressional Republicans as much as Democrats approve of Obama (71% do), congressional Republicans would be no less popular than congressional Democrats are.\nWhy does this matter? Because the politics of these approval numbers do not suggest that the GOP\u2019s disadvantage would redound to the Democrat\u2019s advantage in the midterm election in any clear zero-sum fashion. As Lynn Vavreck and I noted in our piece for CNN, party identification predicts the vote in congressional elections very well. The Republicans who don\u2019t approve of the GOP\u2019s handling of the budget negotiations aren\u2019t likely to go vote for a Democrat.\n3) This all may blow over well before the election.\nThe parameters of a deal are far from certain. The Senate negotiation seems like it might require lawmakers to revisit appropriations and the debt ceiling in the beginning of 2014. But if there is an accord \u2014 and if #1 and 2 are true then both parties have some incentive to produce one \u2014 then by November 2014 this may all seem like distant history. Nate Silver summarized this nicely (with a nice shout-out to The Gamble):\nRemember Syria? The fiscal cliff? Benghazi? The IRS scandal? The collapse of immigration reform? All of these were hyped as game-changing political moments by the news media, just as so many stories were during the election last year. In each case, the public\u2019s interest quickly waned once the news cycle turned over to another story. Most political stories have a fairly short half-life and won\u2019t turn out to be as consequential as they seem at the time.\nAnd Nate Cohn also reminds us that polls can shift. In general, if commentators make any consistent mistake, it is overestimating the importance of the events happening now.\n4) The fundamentals of the midterm don\u2019t really advantage either party very much.\nHere is what Lynn and I said at CNN:\nHeading into 2014, a set of cross-currents seems likely to maintain this partisan balance. Republicans have more seats to defend in the House, and history shows that the larger a party\u2019s majority, the more seats the party is likely to lose. On top of that, the dismal marks that Americans give to Congress tend to hurt the majority party in the House most.\nBut the Democrats face their own challenges. Two key fundamentals in both presidential and midterm elections are the economy and presidential approval. At the moment, the economy is growing only slowly, and approval of Obama has dropped 8 points since January. Both factors could end up hurting congressional Democrats.\nAnother fundamental of congressional elections is the quality of the candidates being recruited. Democratic candidate recruitment has not gone so well that election handicappers give them an edge in many swing districts. Nate Cohn summarizes this nicely. And while the shift in the generic ballot is certainly good news for Democrats, political scientists Joseph Bafumi, Robert Erikson, and Christopher Wlezien have shown that during the election year the generic ballot tends to trend in the opposite direction as the president\u2019s party. This suggests that Democrats will lose ground in generic ballot polling during 2014. So what we\u2019re left with is the potential for either party to make small gains, but less potential for either party to make major gains. Certainly I cannot confidently predict that the Democrats will gain the majority.\n5) The 1995-96 shutdown didn\u2019t necessarily help Clinton that much. \nThe conventional wisdom is that the shutdown helped Clinton in the 1996 election. I think that view has been debunked or at least substantially qualified by Sean Trende, Harry Enten, and Nate Cohn. I\u2019ll show my graph of Clinton approval from my post three years ago (and see also Nate Silver):\n\nTaken together, the two shutdowns left Clinton approval where it was when the first shutdown began. The subsequent increase in approval isn\u2019t evident until weeks after the last shutdown, thanks to a gap in the polling, so it isn\u2019t clear the shutdown had anything to do with it. In short, there is a lot of mythology about the Clinton-era shutdown, but the actual evidence is far more mixed.\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not suggesting that this shutdown has been great for the GOP. It hasn\u2019t. They may even think it\u2019s been worse for them than I do! If that spurs them to make concessions so the government can reopen and we avoid possible default, I think that\u2019s a good outcome, policy-wise.\nBut in the meantime, it seems to me that the prevailing commentary has been too quick to suggest that the GOP will suffer major consequences in the eyes of voters \u2014 now, in 2014, and beyond. My shake of the magic 8-ball says \u201creply hazy.\u201d\n Most Read Politics"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.9", "GPT Reasoning: This is a political analysis/opinion piece about the electoral effects of a government shutdown.

Most notably, reviewers commented on how convenient these were to use at home since they're adjustable and take up much less room in the home than a full set of weights. \nIf you aren't currently incorporating weight training into your routine, there are several reasons to start. For one, according to 2014 research from UCLA, weightlifting can actually help you live longer, since the more muscle mass you have, the less likely you are to die prematurely. And if that isn't enough to convince you, weight training has also been linked to better sleep, stronger bones, better balance and less depression and anxiety. \nHow do these adjustable weights work? This pair of dumbbells replaces 15 pairs of weights. Each one ranges from 5 pounds all the way up to 52.5 pounds. For the first 25 pounds, the weight can be increased by increments of 2.5 pounds. Changing the weight is easy. All you do is use the selection dials to switch in between exercises.

Where are you on the curve?\n (CNN)\nAs safety concerns such as spinal injuries, concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy have emerged around college football and the NFL in recent years, some parents have questioned whether to start their kids in the beloved pastime. \nBut is that really keeping them away? \nIn 2016, an estimated 982,000 US children ages 6 to 12 were core participants in tackle football, according to a Sports and Fitness Industry Association survey conducted on more than 24,000 individuals and households. \nThe number includes any child, boy or girl, who has participated in tackle football 26 or more times a year, whether it is through football organizations, school or even pickup games, the association said. \nThe Parent Curve offers a look at the norms and numbers around tough decisions parents face. Where are you on the curve?\nThat's a 1.8% dip in participation since 2011 -- between 2012 and 2014, youth participation was shrinking by the tens of thousands each year -- but numbers have started to grow, including a 1.7% increase from 2015 to 2016. \nRead More\nMillions more kids ages 6 to 12 play basketball, baseball and outdoor soccer, according to the association. But some sports have seen larger drops in participation, it said, including track and field, which decreased by 24.7% since 2011, outdoor soccer by 19%, baseball by 8.9% and basketball by 4%.\n\nThe decrease in football participation may have been due to concerns of player concussions, noted Jon Butler, executive director of Pop Warner Football, a youth football and cheerleading organization. Other factors might include children specializing in individual sports or fewer children playing organized youth sports overall, he said. \nPop Warner currently has 88,850 kids ages 6 to 12 enrolled in football and has maintained a total football enrollment of more than 225,000 participants in the past five years, according to the organization. \nThe stability of football participation rates over recent years shows that \"there is a strong foundation of kids who love to play football with their parents' support,\" said Steve Alic, a spokesman for USA Football.\n\nIn a 2015 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness noted that most youth football injuries are minor, but \"incidences of severe injuries, catastrophic injuries, and concussion, however, are higher in football than most other team sports and appear to increase with age.\"\nIn its recommendations, the pediatricians' organization said that officials and coaches must enforce rules of the game to ensure safety and that a \"culture of tolerance for head first, illegal hits ... has to change.\" It suggests that participants weigh potential health risks against the recreation benefits of proper tackling. \nDelaying the introduction of tackling would probably decrease risk or injury, the statement said, and teams should try to have athletic trainers on the sidelines during games and practices."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.8", "GPT Reasoning: The article reports and discusses survey data (Sports and Fitness Industry Association figures) about youth tackle football participation and references research-informed safety concerns (concussions, CTE).

Melbourne\u2019s four main reservoirs could suffer an 18% decrease in annual stream flows by 2050. \nThe Climate Council said that increasingly severe droughts were linked to a drop in agricultural productivity and a 15% increase in suicide risk for rural males aged between 30 and 49.\nThe report\u2019s author, Professor Will Steffen, said a much clearer picture of climate change\u2019s influence on drought was emerging through recent research.\n\u201cThere is stronger evidence that the front that brings rain in from the Southern Ocean has shifted south by about a degree in latitude, while the subtropical ridge, which is a belt of high pressure in central Australia, has intensified,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe are seeing this kind of thing consistently around the planet.

VanderLind, who needed surgery and chemotherapy, says her family got rid of their tanning bed shortly after her diagnosis.\nBut unknown numbers of people continue to use tanning beds in private homes. And some health experts worry home tanners may face even greater risks than salon tanners.\n\u201cThis is a radiation-emitting device,\u201d says Sherry Pagoto, a professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts. \u201cAnd radiation can be a very dangerous thing.\u201d\nThe Federal Trade Commission highlighted the danger in announcing recent refunds of $2.59 million to 1,367 consumers who bought home tanning beds from alternative medicine promoter Joseph Mercola. Mercola agreed to pay the refunds and leave the tanning bed business after the FTC said his companies made \u201cfalse and unsupported claims that their indoor tanning systems are safe, that they don\u2019t increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma, and that they can reduce wrinkles.\u201d\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Surgeon General say that the ultraviolet light from indoor tanning devices can cause skin cancer, wrinkles, eye damage and immune suppression.\nBut consumers still can buy new tanning beds at manufacturers\u2019 websites and on Amazon, at prices ranging from about $1,200 to $4,000. Used beds can be found at much lower prices on sites such as Craigslist and eBay.\nNot much research has been done on indoor home tanning, but in 2016, Pagoto and her colleagues published a survey that shed some light on the practice. They found that 27% of adults who have ever tanned indoors have tanned in private homes, and that regular home tanners tan more often than others. Home tanners also show more signs of \u201ctanning addiction,\u201d meaning \u201cthey feel highly compelled to tan\u201d Pagoto says.\nMany also share or sell access to their tanning beds, Pagoto says. \u201cOne person told me they have tanning parties. Their high school daughter will have friends over and each of them take a turn in the tanning bed. Another person had a tanning bed in their garage, and would let people come over, put money in their mailbox and use it.\u201d\nPagoto would like to see more restrictions on salon tanning, including a nationwide ban for minors, which has been proposed but not finalized by the FDA. But she says, \u201cat least tanning salons are required to have their beds inspected,\u201d something home tanners rarely do.\n\u201cIf you bring one of these device into your home, you basically have no restrictions,\u201d says Tim Turnham, past executive director of the non-profit Melanoma Research Foundation. \u201cYou don\u2019t have someone telling you when to stop.\u201d\nAnd if you buy a used bed online, \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you are getting,\u201d says New York City dermatologist Deborah Sarnoff. She is president of The Skin Cancer Foundation, a non-profit group that gets funding from sunscreen makers.\nConsumers should buy new and used beds only from manufacturers or \u201creputable dealers,\u201d says John Overstreet, executive director of the Indoor Tanning Association, a group representing tanning bed manufacturers, distributors and salons.\nBeds sold for home use must come with the same warning labels and instructions that come with commercial beds, Overstreet says. (One FDA-mandated warning label says the beds are not for use by minors). Professional sellers also can answer questions on use and service, he says.\nBut it is better for consumers to come to salons, where staffers teach \u201cthe golden rule of smart tanning, which is \u201cdon\u2019t ever get sunburned,\u201d says Joseph Levy, scientific adviser to the American Suntanning Association, which represents salon owners. He says those hoping to further regulate or shut down salons are \u201crisking driving people to home use, apartments and gyms,\u201d where burning might be more likely.\nSarnoff says tanning, at home or in a salon, inside or outside \u201cis all bad\u201d and that avoiding sunburn does not make it safe.\nMany consumers may be getting that message. Indoor tanning is in decline, according to the CDC. Overstreet says sales of home units are falling. And Levy\u2019s group says more than 10,000 of 18,000 tanning salons operating in 2010 have closed. The group blames a 10% federal \u201ctanning tax\u201d imposed on salon fees as part of the Affordable Care Act, but health advocates cite other factors, including changing consumer attitudes.\n\u201cI do believe that we are seeing signs of a changing culture about tanning,\u201d Turnham says.\nIf you do decide to use a tanning bed, the FDA says you should know: \n\u25baFailure to wear protective eye goggles can lead to short- and long-term eye injury.\n\u25baLong exposures can lead to burning, which you might not notice until many hours later.\n\u25baPeople with skin that burns easily and does not tan should never use indoor tanning devices\nCONNECTTWEET 30 LINKEDINEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lIHaj4"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.9", "GPT Reasoning: The article discusses research-linked health risks of indoor tanning, cites experts and federal health agencies (CDC, FDA, Surgeon General), and reports on findings and regulatory actions based on scientific evidence."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_scientific_3"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "1559.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Report Suggests American Children Left Behind in Economy Recovery"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Share\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n More US children living in poverty, most severe in the South 0:23 \n autoplay autoplay \n ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 A new report on child welfare that found more U.S. children living in poverty than before the Great Recession belies the fanfare of the nation's economic turnaround. \n Twenty-two percent of American children were living in poverty in 2013 compared with 18 percent in 2008, according to the latest Kids Count Data Book, with poverty rates nearly double among African-Americans and American Indians and problems most severe in South and Southwest. \n The report, released Tuesday from the child advocacy group the Annie E. Casey Foundation, showed some signs of slight improvement, including high school graduation rates at an all-time high and a dipping percentage of uninsured children. But the bright spots weren't enough to offset a picture that many children have been left behind amid the nation's economic recovery. \n Here are some things to know about the report: \n ___ \n DIFFERING CAUSES \n The foundation's studies cover 16 different measures, delving into economic well-being, health care, education and family and community issues. \n The problems extend beyond \u2014 and in some cases drive \u2014 increasing poverty rates. More children were raised in single-parent homes in 2013 than in 2008, and fewer lived with parents with secure employment. \n Foundation President Patrick McCarthy said that particularly troubling is an increase in the share of kids living in poor communities, regardless of their own families' economic standing. The report says 1 in 7 children live in those areas, marked by poor schools and a lack of a safe place to play. \n \"They're more likely to fall down the economic ladder, less likely to be employed and more likely to get in trouble,\" McCarthy said. \n ___ \n\n\n A MIX OF FIXES \n McCarthy likened child poverty to a \"particularly pernicious form of cancer,\" and he prescribed a cocktail of economic policies and fixes to tackle it. \n Tax credits and additional support such as food stamps could give low-income families a much-needed boost, and job training could provide help for struggling to get an economic foothold. Businesses should implement more family-friendly policies, and a massive infrastructure repair campaign could create countless jobs. \n \"None of them is a magic bullet. When you put them all together, you start to put the children on a path to success,\" he said. \n ___ \n STRUGGLING IN THE SOUTH \n States in the South and Southwest continued a steady run at the bottom of the Kids Count rankings for overall child well-being, with issues including economic standing and education. \n According to the report, 1 in 3 children from Mississippi live in poverty. Twelve percent of teens from Mississippi and Louisiana were neither in school nor working. Fifteen percent of Nevada children didn't have health insurance, compared with the nation-best 2 percent in Massachusetts. \n ___ \n MIDWEST ON TOP \n Minnesota nabbed the report's top ranking, taking a spot generally reserved for a Northeast state and rounding out the Midwest's strong pattern of supporting children. \n McCarthy said there's not much to make of one state usurping another for a top spot.

Credit Peter DaSilva for The New York Times\n\nHoping to give new meaning to the term \u201cnatural light,\u201d a small group of biotechnology hobbyists and entrepreneurs has started a project to develop plants that glow, potentially leading the way for trees that can replace electric streetlamps and potted flowers luminous enough to read by.\nThe project, which will use a sophisticated form of genetic engineering called synthetic biology, is attracting attention not only for its audacious goal, but for how it is being carried out.\nRather than being the work of a corporation or an academic laboratory, it will be done by a small group of hobbyist scientists in one of the growing number of communal laboratories springing up around the nation as biotechnology becomes cheap enough to give rise to a do-it-yourself movement.\nThe project is also being financed in a D.I.Y. sort of way: It has attracted more than $250,000 in pledges from about 4,500 donors in about two weeks on the Web site Kickstarter.\nThe effort is not the first of its kind. A university group created a glowing tobacco plant a few years ago by implanting genes from a marine bacterium that emits light. But the light was so dim that it could be perceived only if one observed the plant for at least five minutes in a dark room.\nThe new project\u2019s goals, at least initially, are similarly modest. \u201cWe hope to have a plant which you can visibly see in the dark (like glow-in-the-dark paint), but don\u2019t expect to replace your light bulbs with version 1.0,\u201d the project\u2019s Kickstarter page says.\nBut part of the goal is more controversial: to publicize do-it-yourself synthetic biology and to \u201cinspire others to create new living things.\u201d As promising as that might seem to some, critics are alarmed at the idea of tinkerers creating living things in their garages. They fear that malicious organisms may be created, either intentionally or by accident.\nTwo environmental organizations, Friends of the Earth and the ETC Group, have written to Kickstarter and to the Agriculture Department, which regulates genetically modified crops, in an effort to shut down the glowing plant effort.\nThe project \u201cwill likely result in widespread, random and uncontrolled release of bioengineered seeds and plants produced through the controversial and risky techniques of synthetic biology,\u201d the two groups said in their letter demanding that Kickstarter remove the project from its Web site.\n\nArabidopsis, the first plant test subject. Credit Peter DaSilva for The New York Times\n\nThey note that the project has pledged to deliver seeds to many of its 4,000 contributors, making it perhaps the \u201cfirst-ever intentional environmental release of an avowedly \u2018synthetic biology\u2019 organism anywhere in the world.\u201d Kickstarter told the critics to take up their concerns with the project\u2019s organizers. The Agriculture Department has not yet replied.\nAntony Evans, the manager of the glowing plant project, said in an interview that the activity would be safe.\n\u201cWhat we are doing is very identical to what has been done in research laboratories and big institutions for 20 years,\u201d he said. Still, he added, \u201cWe are very cognizant of the precedent we are setting\u201d with the do-it-yourself project and that some of the money raised would be used to explore public policy issues.\nSynthetic biology is a nebulous term and it is difficult to say how, if at all, it differs from genetic engineering.\nIn its simplest form, genetic engineering involves snipping a gene out of one organism and pasting it into the DNA of another. Synthetic biology typically involves synthesizing the DNA to be inserted, providing the flexibility to go beyond the genes found in nature.\nThe glowing plant project is the brainchild of Mr. Evans, a technology entrepreneur in San Francisco, and Omri Amirav-Drory, a biochemist. They met at Singularity University, a program that introduces entrepreneurs to futuristic technology.\nDr. Amirav-Drory runs a company called Genome Compiler, which makes a program that can be used to design DNA sequences. When the sequence is done, it is transmitted to a mail-order foundry that synthesizes the DNA.\nKyle Taylor, who received his doctorate in molecular and cell biology at Stanford last year, will be in charge of putting the synthetic DNA into the plant. The research will be done, at least initially, at BioCurious, a communal laboratory in Silicon Valley that describes itself as a \u201chackerspace for biotech.\u201d\nThe first plant the group is modifying is Arabidopsis thaliana, part of the mustard family and the laboratory rat of the plant world. The organizers hope to move next to a glowing rose.\nScientists have long made glowing creatures for research purposes, including one or more monkeys, cats, pigs, dogs and worms. Glowing zebra fish have been sold in some aquarium shops for years.\n\nMr. Taylor, left, is lead scientist of the glowing plant project, and Mr. Evans its manager. Credit Peter DaSilva for The New York Times\n\nThese creatures typically have the gene for a green fluorescent protein, derived from a jellyfish, spliced into their DNA. But they glow only when ultraviolet light is shined on them.\nOthers going back to the 1980s have transplanted the gene for luciferase, an enzyme used by fireflies, into plants. But luciferase will not work without another chemical called luciferin. So the plants did not glow unless luciferin was constantly fed to them. In 2010, researchers at Stony Brook University reported in the journal Plos One that they had created a tobacco plant that glowed entirely on its own, however dimly. They spliced into the plant all six genes from a marine bacterium necessary to produce both luciferase and luciferin.\nAlexander Krichevsky, who led that research, has started a company, BioGlow, to commercialize glowing plants, starting with ornamental ones, since it is still impractical to replace light bulbs.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like your beautiful flowers to glow in the dark?\u201d he said, invoking the glowing foliage in the movie \u201cAvatar.\u201d\nDr. Krichevsky declined to provide more about the products, timetables or the investors backing his company, which is based in St. Louis.\nWhether it will ever be possible to replace light bulbs remains to be seen and depends to some extent on how much of the plant\u2019s energy can be devoted to light production while still allowing the plant to grow. Mr. Evans said his group calculated, albeit with many assumptions, that a tree that covers a ground area of 10 meters (nearly 33 feet) by 10 meters might be able to cast as much light as a street lamp.\nWhile the Agriculture Department regulates genetically modified plants, it does so under a law covering plant pests.\nBioGlow has already obtained a letter from the department saying that it will not need approval to release its glowing plants because they are not plant pests, and are not made using plant pests. The hobbyist project hopes to get the same exemption.\nTodd Kuiken, senior research associate at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, who has been studying the governance of both synthetic biology and the do-it-yourself movement, said the glowing plant project was an ideal test case.\n\u201cIt exposes the gaps and holes in the regulatory structure, while it is, I would argue, a safe product in the grand scheme of things,\u201d Dr. Kuiken said. \u201cA serious look needs to be taken at the regulatory system to see if it can handle the questions synthetic biology is going to raise.\u201d\nA version of this article appears in print on May 8, 2013, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Dream of Trees Aglow at Night."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article describes a synthetic biology project to create glowing plants, references prior university research creating glowing tobacco, and discusses genetic engineering methods and research-related controversies, so it primarily covers scientific research and development."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_scientific_6"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "4215.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Poll finds public optimistic about the economy, critical of Trump, split on issues"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["January 21 \n\n President Trump arrives to speak to March for Life participants on Friday. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained at a historically low level, compared with past presidents. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \nAmericans have reached a split-screen assessment of the state of the country at the end of President Trump\u2019s first year in office, expressing the most positive views about the economy in nearly two decades while giving Trump historically low approval, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News survey. \nThis stark contrast between perceptions of the economy and assessments of the president continue a pattern that has existed since Trump was sworn in a year ago, that of a president whose personal actions and behavior have stirred controversy and created a political distraction in the face of steady growth, low unemployment and record gains in the stock market.\nHow voters weigh those two views will have a decided impact on the upcoming midterm elections. Democrats, who see an opportunity to take back control of the House and have a possible although uphill path to control of the Senate, will seek to make the November elections about Trump. Republicans hope perceptions of the economy will influence enough voters to hold down their expected losses enough to protect that House majority.\n\nThe new survey finds that 58 percent of all Americans give positive ratings to the state of the economy. That is the highest in a Post-ABC survey in 17 years and seven points higher than on the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration. At the same time, Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained at a historically low level, compared with past presidents. Today, 36 percent approve of the job Trump is doing, while 58 percent disapprove, little changed over the past few months. Strong disapproval of the president, at 49 percent overall, remains twice as high as strong approval, which stands at 24 percent.\nThe public is evenly divided overall and deeply split along partisan lines on three major policy initiatives of the Trump presidency \u2014 the federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants, a reduction in federal regulations on businesses, and an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce. More than 4 in 10 support those policies, and an almost-identical percentage oppose them. But the level of support is slightly higher than Trump\u2019s approval rating, meaning that some Americans \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 who disapprove of the president support those policies.\nOn two of the biggest policy debates of the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 health care and taxes \u2014 the public comes down in opposition to the direction pursued by the administration and congressional Republicans. A majority (57 percent) say the continuation of the Affordable Care Act is a good thing, in essence an expression of relief that Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare as they had long promised to do.\n\nMeanwhile, on the big tax bill passed by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump at the end of last year, 46 percent say it is bad for the country while 34 percent say it is good for the country. That is slightly better than when people were asked whether they supported or opposed the measure as it was being debated. Notably, 20 percent say they have no opinion or are ambivalent about the tax bill, which is likely to become a pivotal battleground for public opinion between the parties ahead of the November midterm elections.\nThe gap between the president\u2019s low approval and the somewhat higher level of support for some of his policies reflects the disconnect between how people see the president and how they view some of his priorities. For example, 21 percent of Democrats who disapprove of the president say the crackdown on undocumented immigrants is a good thing for the country. The same percentage of disapproving Democrats say reducing federal regulations on business is good for the country.\nFor their part, Democrats are struggling to convey a message beyond being anti-Trump, with just over 3 in 10 saying they are presenting alternatives to Trump\u2019s proposals. A 53 percent majority say the Democratic Party is mainly criticizing the president without offering alternatives.\nAs the president begins his second year in office, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and possible cooperation, collusion or knowledge of what was taking place by associates of the Trump campaign continues. Trump has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d although it has produced two guilty pleas, including one from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and charges against Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, and an associate of Manafort\u2019s. \nToday, 50 percent of Americans approve of the way Mueller is proceeding compared with 31 percent who disapprove, with 19 percent expressing no opinion. In early November, 58 percent approved of Mueller\u2019s handling, but in recent weeks, Republicans have targeted the investigation as biased. Among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, approval of Mueller has dropped from 39 percent in November to 30 percent in the new poll. \nHalf of all Americans also say they believe Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Russians, and an almost identical percentage say they believe the president tried to interfere with the investigation. Just over a quarter, 26 percent, say they believe there is solid evidence to buttress this latter assessment.\nThe impact of Trump\u2019s leadership on the public is mixed to negative. Six in 10 Americans say he has accomplished little or nothing. That is better than the 65 percent who said this in November, before passage of the tax bill, but it is a worse rating than received by former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at a similar point in their first terms. A bare majority (53 percent) say Trump\u2019s actions have made no difference to them and their families. The rest are roughly split about the effect of his presidency on them, with 26 percent saying his actions have hurt and 20 percent saying they\u2019ve helped.\n\nOn the economy, Trump receives less credit for the gains seen over the past than does his predecessor, Obama. Fewer than 4 in 10, 38 percent, say the Trump administration deserves significant credit for the state of the economy while 50 percent say the Obama administration should get credit. Republicans and Democrats have sharply opposite views of where the credit should go. Among independents, one-third say Trump should get credit, compared with about half who give credit to Obama.\nAbout 1 in 4 Americans rate the economy positively while disapproving of Trump\u2019s job performance. Three-quarters of them are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, and most of the group says Obama deserves credit for the current state of the economy, not Trump. Even more important is the fact that almost all of them say Trump has acted in a way that is not presidential, one indicator of how his personal behavior has clouded his presidency.\nThe survey finds that Trump and the Republicans have so far failed to shift public opinion on key elements of their agenda. Republican leaders have said that the new tax law \u2014 the party\u2019s biggest accomplishment to date \u2014 will provide lower taxes for most middle-class families. But at this point, 60 percent of Americans see the new measure overall as favoring the rich rather than the middle class or the poor. \nOpposition to Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to curtail illegal immigration remains strong, with 63 percent of Americans saying they are against it, including 52 percent who strongly oppose. But 71 percent of Republicans support the proposal, including 58 percent who support it strongly. The gulf between Republicans on one side and Democrats and independents on the other underscores why this part of border security has been a sticking point in budget negotiations between the two parties.\nCongress has been at a stalemate over the future of the Obama-era policy that protected from deportation undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children. The issue has been a point of contention in recent days as Congress has struggled to reach a spending agreement. Trump rescinded the Obama program last fall and asked Congress to come up with a solution by March. So far that fix has eluded negotiators.\nPublic opinion is clear on this issue, with 87 percent of Americans saying they support a continuation of the protection for those undocumented young people who have completed high school or served in the military and who have no serious criminal record. On this, there is bipartisan agreement among overwhelming majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents.\nTrump\u2019s behavior and fitness shape the other track of his presidency, to his detriment. Seven in 10 Americans say he has acted in a way that is not presidential, while a quarter say his behavior has been fitting and proper for the nation\u2019s chief executive. About 2 in 3 say the president\u2019s use of Twitter has hurt his presidency. A bare majority (52 percent) say he is biased against black people.\nThe president in a recent tweet, which came after a renewed round of questions about his stability in light of a new book that described him in unflattering terms, said he was both mentally stable and a \u201cgenius\u201d for being able to win the White House in his first try for public office. On those two questions, Americans are almost split evenly about his mental stability but by better than 3 to 1 say he is not a genius.\nTrump recently underwent a physical examination that included a test aimed at detecting mild cognitive impairment. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House\u2019s top physician, said the president had a perfect score on the test and dismissed questions about his mental competence.\nThe Post-ABC poll was conducted Jan. 15-18, 2018, among a random sample of 1,005 adults reached on cell and landline phones with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.\n Most Read Politics"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.85", "GPT Reasoning: The article reports results from a Washington Post-ABC News poll \u2014 a survey study presenting findings about public opinion on the economy and President Trump.

Mukasey listens to a question from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) during Mukasey's second day of testimony. (By Susan Walsh -- Associated Press) \nTOOLBOX\n\n\n\n \"He's at least answered the questions, which is better than his predecessor,\" Leahy said, referring to the habit of Alberto R. Gonzales, who resigned last month as attorney general, of being unable to recall details or make clear declarations. \"He's going to be different than Gonzales on all the issues, I think. He will certainly be better than Gonzales on morale.\" \n Amid charges by lawmakers from both parties that Gonzales had inappropriately politicized the Justice Department, Mukasey drew bipartisan praise Wednesday for promising to resign rather than implement any policies that he believes violate the Constitution. But Mukasey also suggested that he would side with the Bush administration's views on presidential authority, a stance he made clearer yesterday. \n Asked about executive privilege, a legal doctrine presidents have cited to avoid disclosing records related to their deliberations, Mukasey endorsed the administration's argument that it covers more than communications directly involving the president. He also said that it would be inappropriate, in a battle between Congress and the White House over access to such documents, for a U.S. attorney to pursue contempt charges against a White House official who is following the legal advice of the Justice Department in refusing access. \n Several contempt citations were approved this summer by the House Judiciary Committee against current and former White House officials over their refusal to testify in the ongoing congressional investigations of the firings of nine U.S. prosecutors. Leahy suggested yesterday a \"real probability\" that more citations are on the way. \n \"It simply can't be appropriate for the same department that offered the opinion [allowing wide use of executive privilege] then to turn around and prosecute somebody who followed it,\" Mukasey said. \n Some of the most tense exchanges at the hearing centered on whether the president must strictly abide by provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a 1978 law that governs clandestine spying in the United States. Mukasey suggested that the president can ignore a law, including the surveillance act, if it unduly impinges on his constitutional authority as commander in chief during wartime. \n \"The president is not putting somebody above the law; the president is putting somebody within the law,\" Mukasey said. \"The president doesn't stand above the law. But the law emphatically includes the Constitution.\" \n Leahy said he was \"troubled\" by the answer: \"I see a loophole big enough to drive a truck through.\" \n Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who had questioned Mukasey on the same topic on Wednesday, complained that the nominee had gone from being \"agnostic\" to holding a \"disturbing view.\" \n \"You've suggested that I've gone overnight from being an agnostic to being a heretic. . . . I haven't,\" Mukasey responded, though he did not elaborate. \n Mukasey also amplified his opposition to a proposed federal shield law for journalists that the Judiciary Committee has already approved. The bill attracted bipartisan support after several high-profile cases in which reporters were jailed or threatened with contempt charges for refusing to divulge the identities of sources. \n Mukasey said that the current system has worked \"passably well\" and that any problems could be solved by changes to internal Justice Department rules. He noted that he worked briefly as a wire service reporter and later represented media organizations as a lawyer in private practice, but he echoed Bush administration arguments that such a law could be used to protect journalists who are acting as spies or terrorists. \n At one point, a flustered Leahy asked Mukasey \"whether you received some criticism from anybody in the administration last night after your testimony,\" leading to a different set of answers at yesterday's hearing. \n \"I received no criticism,\" said Mukasey, who was measured and soft-spoken throughout his testimony. \"I had dinner with my family last night.\" \n Staff researcher Madonna Lebling contributed to this report. \n\u00a9 2007 The Washington Post Company"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article discusses political and legal matters\u2014Senate testimony of an attorney general nominee, executive privilege, and congressional investigations\u2014not scientific research, studies, or academic findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_0"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "3390.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["UCI reduces field size in road races to improve safety"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["BERGEN, Norway (AP) \u2014 Cycling's governing body has decided to reduce the number of riders in major road races in an effort to improve safety.\nThere will now be a maximum of 176 riders in the peloton in all road events on the International Cycling Union calendar.

Adam K Thompson, Zoo Atlanta\nLast SlideNext Slide\n\nWith spring turning into summer, this is the perfect time to find plenty of cute baby animals at zoos across the USA. From little cheetahs in San Diego to snow leopard cub triplets in Akron, Ohio to a cotton-top tamarin in Boston, here are the cutest baby animals to check out at zoos across the country right now:\nThe San Diego Zoo Safari Park welcomed cheetah mom Addison and her six cubs this spring. The little cheetahs were born on Nov. 21, 2015 at the park's cheetah breeding center, but just made their public debut at the park. They are Addison's second litter, and also set a record as the largest number of cubs raised by a cheetah at the Safari Park. There are four female cubs, named Darlene, Geisel, L.C., and Mary Jane, and two male cubs, Donald and Copley. The San Diego Safari Park is one of nine breeding facilities as part of the cheetah Breeding Center Coalition. The coalition\u2019s goal is to create a sustainable cheetah population that will prevent extinction of the world\u2019s fastest land animal.\nBaby orangutan \u2013 Indianapolis Zoo\nThe Indianapolis Zoo welcomed a baby orangutan when 23-year-old mom Sirih, a Sumatran orangutan, gave birth to the newborn female, Mila, on March 23. The event was cause to celebrate because it was the first birth for the $26 million Simon Skodt International Orangutan Center at the Indy Zoo. Orangutans are highly endangered thanks to destruction of forests in their native homeland in Sumatra and Borneo.\nNigerian dwarf goat & cotton-top tamarin \u2013 Franklin Park Zoo\nThe Franklin Park Zoo has two new babies to see this spring. First up is Chewbacca, a Nigerian dwarf goat, who was born to mom Leia and dad Lucky on February 16. She is the goat couple's second kid. The zoo also welcomed a baby cotton-top tamarin to parents Wilma and Federico. The sex of the newest family member is not yet known, but the little tamarin joins its parents and siblings Pebbles and Betty in the Tropical Forest exhibit at the zoo. \u201cCotton-top tamarins are very social animals and our guests will have the unique opportunity to observe the family dynamics as the baby grows up,\u201d said Jeannine Jackle, who is the Assistant Curator of the Tropical Forest.\nSnow leopard cubs \u2013 Akron Zoo\nIn Akron, Ohio, the Akron Zoo was proud to announce that snow leopard mom Shanti gave birth to her first set of triplets. This was a first for the zoo. Although 7-year-old Shanti has had other litters before, she has never given birth to three cubs at once. The little snow leopards were born on March 5, only weighed about a pound each, and did not open their eyes until they were two weeks old. The family is currently off-exhibit in a private cubbing area with their mom, but will be on display to the public as the get older, most likely by the end of the month. The zoo also plans to announce a naming contest for the cubs in the near future. Snow leopards are an endangered species, with only around 4,000 left in the wild, primarily due to loss of habitat, illegal poaching for their pelts and body parts and killings by local herders when a snow leopard has preyed on their livestock.\nIn Los Angeles, 8-year-old mom Halali and 18-year-old dad Billy welcomed an antelope baby Rayne on January 6. The first baby animal born at the zoo in 2016, Rayne is a black duiker. In the wild, black duikers are found in parts of West Africa between Guinea and the coast of Nigeria. Rayne is currently being cared for at the zoo's nursery along with Noah, who is a red flanked duiker born just before Christmas. Red flanked duikers are some of the smallest antelope species and are found in western and central Africa.\nThere's a new bonobo baby named Max at the Columbus Zoo. The bonobo is in the great ape family and is similar to a chimpanzee. Max was the fourth baby for mother Lady, who is caring for the newborn in the company of the other bonobos in her group. Because bonobos live in dynamic groups, Max's father has yet to be identified, but will be once the results of the genetic paternity testing come back. Max is the 15th bonobo born at the Columbus Zoo since it received its first bonobos in 1990 in conjunction with the Species Survival Plan for this endangered ape. There are only seven facilities in North America caring for bonobos and of those facilities the Columbus Zoo has the second largest group with 17.\nLowland Gorilla \u2013 Fort Worth Zoo\nFirst time western lowland gorilla parents Gracie and Elmo welcomed their first baby on December 5, 2015. The baby male gorilla, Augustus (or Gus for short), was also the first birth of a western lowland gorilla for the Fort Worth Zoo. Zoo officials say the young gorilla will stay close to his mother while getting acclimated at the World of Primates exhibit. He can be seen in indoor and outdoor exhibits at various times during the day, depending on the weather and his activity level. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers western lowland gorillas to be critically endangered due to poaching, habitat loss and disease in its native Republic of Congo. The Fort Worth Zoo is the only zoo in the nation to house representatives of all four great ape species: gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees and bonobos.\nPrehensile-tailed porcupine \u2013 Binghamton Zoo\nIn Binghamton, N.Y., second-time porcupine parents Mattie and Zoey welcomed their latest addition, a 410-gram prehensile-tailed porcupine on St Patrick's Day. The baby's sex has not yet been determined, so it does not have a name, but it has already joined its parents and sister Norwan on exhibit in the New World Tropics building. Prehensile-tailed porcupines are found in South America. They are not born with sharp or barbed quills. Instead, the quills are soft and bendable, gradually hardening in the first few days after birth until they reach maturity after 10 weeks.\nMasai giraffe \u2013 Brevard Zoo\nStanding tall at 6\u20194\u201d just a little over a month after he was born, Brevard Zoo\u2019s newest addition is also the tallest Masai giraffe ever born at the facility. After a gestation period lasting more than a year, 14-year-old Milenna gave birth to the male calf early on March 7. The little one is the second giraffe born at the Florida zoo in under four months. A female, who has yet to be named, was born to another giraffe, Johari, on November 29, 2015. Seventeen-year-old Rafiki is the father of both calves. The calf is not expected to make its public debut for several weeks while he bonds with his mother behind the scenes, but photos and videos of the baby can be found via the zoo's social media channels.\nMultiple species \u2013 Zoo Atlanta\nZoo Atlanta has said hello to a number of new babies from various species this year. The first animal born at the zoo in 2016 was a milky eagle owlet named Rwenzori. The milky eagle owl is Africa\u2019s largest owl species, and Rwenzori may stand up to two feet tall when fully grown. In April, Zoo Atlanta welcomed its first kori bustard chick ever hatched here. Kori bustards are the largest flighted bird species and are native to southern Africa but are also classified as near threatened. The chick is currently being cared for by zoo staff until he or she is old enough to meet first-time parents Tuza and Snake. Finally, Zoo Atlanta welcomed four Guatemalan beaded lizards, which are one of the world's most rare lizard species with only 350 or so believed to remain in the wild where they are exclusive to Guatemala's Motagua Valley.\nCONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDINEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TctupJ"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.9", "GPT Reasoning: The piece is a human-interest roundup of baby animals at zoos and breeding program highlights for visitors.

Talk about new beginnings...we barely knew how to ask for milk, bread, and eggs.\nBut we did have some things going for us. They were, in fact, all the things Ecuador had going for it -- low cost of living, perfect weather, and some of the friendliest, most understanding people on the planet.\nWe knew this beforehand, of course... Ecuador was featured on International Living's annual retirement index that year. (In fact, Ecuador came in #1 for many years in a row, but this year another country has earned the top spot. If you've never been there, you may be surprised, but if you have, you certainly won't be. There are several surprises on this year's index.

There are reasons that certain places become popular expat destinations for North Americans, and we've been to and written about most of them.\nAll of these special places have particular things going for them, just as we discovered about Ecuador on our first overseas adventure. Some may have incredible weather, others remarkably low costs of living, and still others great medical care or top-notch infrastructure and amenities. These days there are a total of 10 categories used by International Living to rank retirement destinations, and the countries near the top of the list are there because they have good scores in nearly all of those categories.\n\nLlamas in Parque Metropolitano in Quito, Ecuador\nThe index comes out every January, and we study it as soon as it does.

It's something we sit down with and pore over, circling this ranking, underlining that score, comparing and contrasting potential retirement destinations like we'd compare and contrast toys and tools in that catalogue.\nThe New Year just brings that out in us... the intrigue and attraction of new beginnings and new possibilities.\nBut as we ourselves discovered 15 years ago, the toys and tools in the retirement index can actually change your life.

The poll was conducted prior to the hearing on Jan. 31, when the former Republican senator struggled to answer questions about his positions on a range of defense-related issues.\nThe poll (below) was leaked to Breitbart News, which confirmed its authenticity with the poll\u2019s sponsor, SecureAmericaNow.org, a national security PAC. Pollster Pat Caddell, a FOX News contributor and former aide to President Jimmy Carter, acknowledged that the poll had been provided to Senators prior to the hearing, though he expressed surprise that it had been leaked. Supporters and opponents of Hagel\u2019s confirmation have engaged in a war of information behind the scenes as they attempt to woo support from both parties.\nThe poll, which surveyed 800 likely general election voters by telephone, found that only 48% approved of Hagel, against 27% who disapproved. (A similar poll by Politico in mid-January found that 42% of Americans supported Hagel while 24% opposed him.) When voters were presented with arguments for and against Hagel, based on his record, there was a massive 32-point negative shift: 50% disapproved against 39% who approved.\nThe poll concluded: \u201cthere is a significant disconnect between Senator Hagel\u2019s views and the majority of Americans\u2013including many supporters of the President.\u201d Those differences primarily concerned Hagel\u2019s views on American security, not his views on Israel, and outweighed the advantage gained when voters knew of his military record.\nThe wide swing in approval suggests that support for Hagel could become a significant liability for Democrats up for re-election in largely Republican states (e.g. Louisiana, North Carolina, Alaska, etc.) in 2014. Strong public opposition to Hagel, which has been absent thus far save for the work of the Republican Jewish Coalition, Christians United for Israel, and a few others, could likely swing mainstream opinion away from him. \nThe only publicly available poll data taken after the confirmation hearing was released on Feb. 4 by Rasmussen, showing that 33% of voters approved of Hagel and 33% did not, while 75% expected him to be confirmed regardless. Talk of a possible Republican filibuster was quieted when Sen.

There will be a military aspect to that,\" Obama said. \"And it's going to be important for Congress to know what that is, in part because it may cost some money.\"\nOn Capitol Hill, Republicans said that strategy needs to come quickly.\n\"If the President is prepared to engage Congress with a strategic plan to protect the U.S. and our allies from ISIL, I believe he will have significant congressional support,\" said Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. \"But don't forget, the threat from ISIL is real and it's growing \u2014 and it is time for President Obama to exercise some leadership in launching a response.\"\nObama referred to the Islamic State as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which is one of the three ways officials refer to the group.\nObama made a clear distinction between the response to the Islamic State in Iraq, where the United States is trying to encourage a new, more inclusive government to fight the militants, and in Syria, where the United States won't cooperate with the regime of President Bashar Assad.\nIn Iraq, Obama has authorized daily air strikes of Islamic State targets. The U.S. Central Command in Tampa Thursday confirmed five more strikes against militants' vehicles and checkpoints near the Mosul Dam, bringing the total number of air strikes to 106 over three weeks.\nObama's remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon came before a meeting of his National Security Council in the White House Situation Room.\nObama also ruled out military action in Ukraine, saying economic sanctions are hurting Russia. \"It is not in the cards for us to see a military confrontation between Russia and the United States in this region,\" he said.\nHe said there's no doubt that Russia is responsible for the violence in the former Soviet republic, and would pay a price for that.\n\"This is not a homegrown indigenous uprising in eastern Ukraine. The separatists are backed, armed and financed by Russia. We've seen deep Russian involvement in everything they've done,\" he said.\nObama travels to Estonia and Wales next week for meetings with NATO allies about Ukraine. He also spoke Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the two agreed that additional sanctions are necessary, the White House said.\n\"Russia is already more isolated than at any time since the end of the Cold War. This ongoing Russian incursion into Ukraine will only bring more costs,\" he said.\nFollow @gregorykorte on Twitter.\nCONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDINEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1pmwy66"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article covers President Obama's comments on a military and political strategy regarding IS/ISIL in Syria and reactions from Congress \u2014 it is political/military news, not reporting on scientific research or academic studies."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_8"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "3186.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["AP source: Beckham plans to unveil Miami MLS team on Monday"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["MIAMI (AP) \u2014 David Beckham's plan to bring Major League Soccer back to South Florida is on the cusp of becoming reality.\nBeckham and his partners are planning a Monday event to formally announce Miami's new MLS team, as well as its name and logo, a person with direct knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

No matter where you come from, or how you feel about things in the world today, Joel Fagliano\u2019s crossword theme is a really funny play on words, which is what we come here to enjoy.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m going to talk about it. I hope you will, too.\nToday\u2019s Theme\nMr. Fagliano cuts one column off his puzzle today in order to show off his \u201cSupreme Intelligence.\u201d By doing so, he is able to stretch his revealer, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE across the grid.\nThat\u2019s funny because Mr. Fagliano has also managed to pack six former and current Supreme Court justices in his puzzle, but their names are obstructed by black squares. That had to be incredibly hard to do and still fill the puzzle well.\nFor example, we have ANTONIN SCALIA stretching across 1-, 8- and 11-Across, and ABE FORTAS, EARL WARREN, ELENA KAGAN, SONIA SOTOMAYOR and STEPHEN BREYER appear as well. I\u2019m sad that Mr. Fagliano was not able to fit my own favorite Supreme, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in the puzzle, but that would have been tough.\nAdvertisement\nTricky Clues\n18A: O.K., so we know that \u201cWorked on some screenwriting?\u201d doesn\u2019t have anything to do with writing for film because of that question mark at the end of the clue. What other kind of screens do you \u201cwrite\u201d on? How about that computer in front of you? The answer is EMAILED.\n71A: There are apparently a lot of words that can describe someone who abuses alcohol. I\u2019m used to seeing SOT in the puzzle, but I hadn\u2019t head of the clue \u201cStewbum\u201d before.\n79A: Homonym alert! Did you think this was an \u201cIndication to bow slowly\u201d from the waist? Not today. Today, we are bowing a string instrument, and the answer is the musical direction LENTO. Tricky one.\n115A: The answer to \u201cDum-dums\u201d is STUPIDS, which I was sure I had heard of before. It hasn\u2019t been in The New York Times Crossword since 1958, but there was a series of books which became a British-Canadian series which became an American film called \u201cThe Stupids,\u201d about a family who is \u2026 well, I\u2019ll let you find out:\nThe Stupids Trailer 1996 Video by Video Detective\n119A: A brooding sort might seem like one of those dark and mysterious heartthrobs, but today we\u2019re just laying eggs.

The House bill repealed the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserved the property tax deduction up to $10,000 to assuage concerns from New York and New Jersey Republicans.\nBut the differences don't end there. While the House bill eventually repealed the estate tax in its entirety, the Senate bill won't repeal the tax, but instead will double the exemption meaning fewer families will pay it.\nThe Senate bill also maintains a provision to allow individuals to write off medical expenses that exceed a certain amount of their income, something the House bill scrapped entirely. The issue has become a major flashpoint in the debate in the House. North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven acknowledged Thursday that watching the fights play out in the House helped inform the Senate bill.\n\"Look, as we hear things from our constituents and analyze them, it's helped us,\" Hoeven said.\nRead More\nRepublican senators were briefed on their legislation Thursday morning, but an official plan and score of the Senate proposal wasn't released until Thursday evening. That plan also highlighted that while the Senate bill would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20%, the Senate will delay the implementation of the lower rate until after December 2018. \nThe Senate plan came as the House voted Thursday afternoon along party lines to pass their own bill out of the ways and means committee. \nMost members emerging from the meeting said that the Senate bill was at the very least a step in the right direction.\n\"The conversation, the negotiation will continue until we arrive on consensus,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said of the initial plan he saw in the conference. \"This is an ongoing discussion.\"\nStill there is more work to do.\nWhile the Senate bill hits its spending target in the 10-year window of costing no more than $1.5 trillion, the bill will still have to be adjusted because the growing costs make clear it will add to the deficit outside the 10-year window. It's something Senate finance committee aides acknowledged Thursday, making clear more work needed to be done to ensure the proposal would be compliant with budget rules. \nUnder reconciliation rules, the special process that allows the Senate Republicans to pass the bill with just a simple majority, the Senate tax bill cannot add to the deficit after 10 years by even one cent.\nRepublicans on both sides of the Capitol have laid out an aggressive timeline to pass their tax bills out of both chambers. The ultimate goal is to have a tax cut bill on the President desk before the end of the year.\nSenate Republicans unveiled their plan just days after Democrats swept state races in New Jersey and Virginia -- an election GOP members said was a wake-up call that their party needs to pass at least one major legislative accomplishment or else face electoral backlash in the midterms.\n\"If we don't produce, it'll get worse,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina told CNN. \"The antidote to this problem is to pass a tax cut that Americans believe helps them and their families, to replace a broken health care system with something better. And if we do those things, I think we'll do fine in the fall.\"\nSenators are especially feeling the weight of the task ahead. Unlike the House where after fits and starts the party eventually came together to overhaul Obamacare, the Senate failed to pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act this summer and members are emphatic that they cannot afford to be 0-2 heading into the 2018 midterms, no matter how good the map looks for them.\nSenators are constrained in a way that House tax writers technically aren't. Under Senate rules, the Senate finance committee must produce a tax plan that doesn't increase the deficit by any more than $1.5 trillion over the next decade. \nThat is part of the reason that Senate Republicans are considering phasing in a new corporate rate of 20% rather than starting it right off the bat, which is expensive. While President Donald Trump has been clear he wants to see a corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 20% immediately, the cost may be too great.\n\"We haven't made that decision ultimately on that delay,\" said South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. \"There's a lot of pressure to do it now.\"\nSome Senate Republicans Including Florida's Marco Rubio have also lobbied to increase the child tax credit to $2,000 up from the increase to $1,600 in the House bill. And Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has lobbied the committee not to fully repeal the estate tax, which the House bill repeals after 2023.\n\"The bill is going to be released either tomorrow or Friday. Until it is, I've been asked not to comment on the specifics,\" Collins said. \"But it certainly is true I've expressed reservations about having complete repeal of the estate tax.\"\nAnother major change in the Senate bill could be a full repeal of the state and local tax -- also known as SALT -- deduction.\nSALT, as it's known on Capitol Hill, became a major touchstone in the US House where more than a dozen Republicans from high tax states like New Jersey and New York fought to preserve at least a core part of the tax write off. After a handful of closed-door meetings in the House, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady announced he'd preserve the tax deduction for property taxes up to $10,000, but that deductions on income or sales taxes would be repealed.\nHowever, unlike the House where the GOP's majority is dependent on a handful of members from swing districts in blue states where property taxes are high, most of the Republican senators hail from lower-tax states that are more solidly Republican and less dependent on the SALT deduction.\n\nStill, House Republicans are warning that a full repeal of SALT could be trouble for passing the tax bill through the full Congress.\n\"I will be very clear. Repealing the state and local tax deduction is just not a policy that will make its way through the House side. The Senate indications that they may potentially do that, I just don't see how that math works to get to tax reform,\" said Rep. Tom Reed, a Republican from New York.\nReed said he'd been talking to senators about the issue.\n\"I think it's very clear. You have 73 Republicans from the House that come from high-tax states. If you go down the path of trying to repeal the entire state and local tax in the Senate, than that is just not going to work,\" he said. \nAdding to the complications for the Senate is the margins by which Senate Republicans have to pass a tax bill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two of his own senators if he is going to pass the bill along party lines. \nThere is some effort to bring Democrats on board, but after a closed-door meeting in the Library of Congress Tuesday afternoon between a handful of Democrats, White House legislative director Marc Short and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, Democrats were still waiting to see how the process would move forward before committing to sign on. During the meeting, Trump called in from Asia to try to sell Democrats on the plan, telling them he'd be a \"big loser\" if the GOP plan is signed into law.\n\"If they put this bill out Friday and then try to jam it on Monday, move it through ... it's not real bipartisanship,\" warned Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.\nOverall, Republicans are still optimistic that they can shepherd their bill through committee and pass it on the floor. \n\"I feel different than with healthcare,\" said Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran. \"That there's a greater likelihood that involves passage of tax reform.\"\nAs to how they will settle what could be grave differences between the House and the Senate bill?\n\"I think this process is a healthy one. We're going to look to improve our bill at every step in the way. We hope the Senate passes their very best version of tax reform, as well,\" Brady told CNN's Phil Mattingly in an exclusive interview Wednesday. \"What I'm confident of (is) we will reconcile and find common ground in the end.\"\nThis story has been updated and will continue to update with new developments. \nCNN's Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article discusses political and legislative details of a Senate tax bill and differences from the House plan; it covers policy/news rather than reporting on scientific research or study findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_15"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "2464.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Linda Nochlin obituary"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Feminist art historian who touched a nerve with her 1971 article Why Have There Been No Great Woman Artists? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLinda Nochlin attending the Brooklyn Museum Sackler Center First awards in New York in 2012. Photograph: Donna Ward/Abaca USA/PA\n\nLinda Nochlin, who has died aged 86, was one of art history\u2019s great troublemakers. Her article Why Have There Been No Great Woman Artists?, published in Art News in 1971, is credited as a founding text of feminist art history. Mischievous, provocative and iconoclastic, Nochlin took on the powerful institutions of the art world, especially as they impacted on women.\nNothing was sacred for her: not the canonical adulation of \u201cgreat\u201d men inscribed in art history\u2019s grand narratives, nor the category of \u201cgenius\u201d confined to the male of the species; not the historical limitation of women to the roles of model or muse, nor the impoverished image of female sexuality corralled to the service of society. For her there was no level playing field. Art happened in the world, shot through by power and politics.\nNochlin\u2019s feminism was formed in the women\u2019s movement of the 1960s. The only child of Jules Weinberg, a newspaper distributor, and Elka Heller, she was born in New York, and grew up in the liberal enclaves of Brooklyn\u2019s secular Jewish intelligentsia. Her mother encouraged Linda to surpass the reigning expectations of girlhood and to turn her precocious passion for reading, art and music into a lifelong commitment to writing.\nHer radical awakening happened in 1969, and as a young professor at Vassar College (her alma mater) she began teaching the first course in Women and Art. By then she had been widowed (her first husband, Philip Nochlin, died in 1960) and remarried (in 1968, to the architectural historian Richard Pommer). She had earned a PhD in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts of NYU where, in 1963, she submitted a dissertation on realism in the work of Gustave Courbet.\nHer two great professional commitments were already in place: an attachment to 19th-century French painting, its realist aesthetics and political engagement; and a lifelong exploration of what it is to think, write and view as a woman.\nThough she remained devoted to modernist \u201cmasters\u201d \u2013 to Courbet she added Manet, Degas and Seurat, among others \u2013 she was passionately concerned with the relationship between beauty and social justice. For her the two were intertwined. The challenge of avant-garde art was its capacity to destabilise conventional wisdom, to trouble representation itself. But what complicated the picture was sexual politics. For enmeshed in the project of modernity were misogyny and misanthropy on a large scale.\nNothing excited Nochlin more than to unravel and reveal these contradictions. Where feminists rounded on Renoir as an oppressive purveyor of the \u201cnatural\u201d, she revelled in his late nudes as celebrations of flesh in a world which restricted women into corsets. She saw in Degas\u2019 brothel monotypes a sanctuary from stifling bourgeois norms rather than simply a manifestation of misogyny. Art, at its best, provoked pleasure and pain. And criticism, to be worth its salt, needed, in the words of Charles Baudelaire, to be \u201cpartial, passionate, political\u201d.\nPainted bodies interested Nochlin most of all. In a series of essays, anthologised as Women, Art and Power (1988), The Politics of Vision (1989) and Representing Women (1999), she took on all genres and norms. Drawing on Edward Said\u2019s 1978 work Orientalism, for example, she analysed the operations of race and colonial mastery that promoted cliches of indolent natives and sultry women. In Seurat\u2019s Poseuses, a pointillist confection of semi-clad women in a studio, she saw the working-class origins of the models as a corrective to the classical nude. In her study of Berthe Morisot\u2019s The Wet Nurse Angele, which depicts Morisot\u2019s daughter Julie being breastfed by her nurse, Nochlin examined the desiring gaze of the mother-artist, captured in a fury of brushwork, and demystified the role of the nurse as a hired labourer.\nNochlin did not confine her writing to the historical. She wrote scores of essays and reviews on contemporaries, championing figures from Alice Neel to Sarah Lucas as well as friends such as Sylvia Sleigh and Deborah Kass. Her capacity for friendship was enormous. Among her intimates, she counted many former students, drawn from years of teaching at Vassar, CUNY Graduate Center and the Institute of Fine Arts at NYU.\nWith Richard (known as Dick), she created a home in Manhattan that was infused with warmth and filled with photographs and art \u2013 her favourite was a realist portrait by Phillip Pearlstein of the young couple in 60s fashion and style. As she grew older, Nochlin wrote about ageing, notably in relation to the French sculptor Louise Bourgeois, from whose defiance and engagement with a feminised eroticism and subversive sexuality she drew personal strength and political punch.\nNochlin was still writing in the last year of her life, turning again to her love for the 19th century in her last book, Mis\u00e8re, a study of social misery as portrayed in 19th-century art and literature, to be published next year.\nRichard died in 1992. She is survived by their daughter, Daisy, and her daughter, Jessica, from her first marriage, and grandchildren, Julia and Nick.\n\u2022 Linda Nochlin, art historian, born 30 January 1931; died 29 October 2017\n Topics"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.92", "GPT Reasoning: This is an obituary about art historian Linda Nochlin and her influence on feminist art history, not a report of scientific studies or research findings.

When Trump couldn't keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim,\" Powell wrote in an August email.\nThe messages, the existence of which were first reported by BuzzFeed and The Intercept, were posted to DCleaks, an organization affiliated with other recent hacks of high-profile figures.\nPeggy Cifrino, an aide to Powell, told CNN: \"The emails are accurate. No further comment at this time.\" \nRead More\n\n\nGOP senator challenged: Who's worse, Trump or Clinton?\nReplay\nMUST WATCH\n 01:04\nThe emails are notable for their candor about Trump. Powell, who oversaw the State Department during the beginning of George W. Bush's administration, hasn't endorsed Trump and has largely sidestepped questions about his thoughts on the controversial GOP nominee. \nPowell also lampooned Trump's proposal that he could win over the African-American population.\n\"For him to say yesterday that within four years he would have 95% of blacks voting for him is schizo fantasy,\" Powell wrote, adding, \"And (former Fox News chief Roger) Ailes as an adviser won't heal with women.\"\nMoreover, the former secretary of state tore into Trump as an embarrassing figure to represent the United States. \n\"Trump is a national disgrace and an international pariah,\" Powell wrote in June. \n\"He appeals to the worst angels of the GOP nature and poor white folks,\" Powell wrote in another email.\nAs Trump's lead in the Republican primary solidified, Powell complained to CNN's Fareed Zakaria about the network's political coverage. \n\"You guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,\" Powell wrote in December.\nOn Wednesday night, Trump tweeted his disdain for Powell.\nI was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster.

I gave her written guidance on why and how I had been doing it.\"\nClinton appeared on CNN shortly thereafter and told Anderson Cooper that the blame rested with her. \nCheryl Mills, a former staffer for Clinton, forwarded the transcript of Clinton's CNN interview to Powell, a leaked message shows. \nHe responded to Mills, calling the comments \"very nice.\" \n\"The only thing I would add is to simply say she had a private account on a public server before becoming SecState and continued to use it when she became SecState. On the other hand this might to lead to questions about the basement,\" Powell said. \n\n\nJUST WATCHED\nReport: Colin Powell advised Clinton on email \nReplay\nMUST WATCH\n 01:59\nOn August 28, he said that Clinton \"could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it. I told her staff three times not to try that gambit.\"\nWednesday's email leak was not the first time Powell's private thoughts were revealed. In 2013, a hacker known as \"Guccifer\" infiltrated Powell's email. The Romanian hacker, Marcel Lazar, also managed his way into the digital spaces of some members of the Bush family and Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal. \nLazar was sentenced to 52 months in prison on September 1.\nThese leaks came from DCleaks on the same day a hacker by the alias \"Guccifer 2.0\" released more information from the Democratic National Committee. Experts have pointed to Russian state elements as the actors behind the DNC leaks.\nPowell, Rice talk Iraq War\nAn exchange in 2015 showed Powell and his successor, former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, critiquing some of their former colleagues in the Bush administration.\nRice forwarded a link to story about Bob Woodward slamming former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's recent commentary on the Iraq War. \n\n\nJUST WATCHED\nState Department: Colin Powell had classified emails\nReplay\nMUST WATCH\n 01:28\nRice praised Woodward and added: \"First, we didn't invade Iraq to bring democracy --- but once we overthrew Saddam (Hussein), we had a view of what should follow.

Minnesota 2016 Unemployment: 3.9% (13th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 79.8% (18th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 9.9% (6th lowest) Ranking as the 10th best run state as recently as 2012, Minnesota has climbed steadily in the rankings in recent years and is now the best run state in the country. A relatively wealthy state, Minnesota\u00d5s $65,599 median household income is about $8,000 more than the median income nationwide. With a strong tax base, the state brings in about $4,400 a year per resident in taxes, more than all but four other states. In Minnesota, higher tax revenue means the government can save more. The state has saved the equivalent of 10.3% of its annual spending in a rainy day fund -- more than most states and greater than the 8.2% average across states. Minnesota has a nearly perfect credit rating from Moody\u00d5s with a stable outlook. fotoguy22, Getty Images/iStockphoto \n\n None \n 2. Utah 2016 Unemployment: 3.4% (8th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 85.7% (12th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 10.2% (7th lowest) Utah\u00d5s population has increased by about one-third since 2000. As Utah\u00d5s population expanded, the state has been able to achieve smart, sustainable growth. Water consumption fell by approximately 25%, largely due to increases in housing density that resulted in smaller lot sizes. Air pollution has fallen by roughly 50%, partially as the result of an extensive clean air campaign. Also, the number of vehicle miles traveled per person has remained largely unchanged due to increases in density and public transit infrastructure. Due in part to a growing GDP, the state\u00d5s economy has easily accommodated the population influx. Utah\u00d5s economy expanded by 3.7% in 2016, nearly the fastest GDP growth among states and more than double U.S. economic growth the same year. As of 2016, just 3.4% of Utah's workforce were unemployed, and only 10.2% of residents lived in poverty, far less than the 4.9% national unemployment and 14.0% poverty rates.

Iowa 2016 Unemployment: 3.7% (10th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 85.1% (13th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 11.8% (18th lowest) Iowa has one of the healthiest job markets in the country. Just 3.7% of the Iowa workforce were unemployed in 2016, the 10th lowest unemployment rate of any state. For the small share of residents looking for a job, Iowa has one of the most generous unemployment insurance systems of any state. Some 40% of unemployed residents in the state receive unemployment benefits, far more than the 27% national rate. Also, the average weekly UI benefit is $398, or 45% of Iowa\u00d5s average weekly wage -- the fifth highest replacement rate of any state. Iowa is also one of the most fiscally responsible states in the country. While across all states, average state government debt amounts to 52.2% of total state tax revenue, Iowa\u00d5s debt load amounts to just 26.1% -- one of the smallest shares in the country. Additionally, Iowa\u00d5s rainy day funds could cover about 10% of the state\u00d5s 2018 fiscal year budget, slightly better than the average across all states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 4. Oregon 2016 Unemployment: 4.9% (20th highest) Pension funded ratio: 91.9% (6th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 13.3% (24th highest) Oregon lawmakers have long exemplified fiscal responsibility. The state\u00d5s pension system is 91.9% funded, the sixth largest share in the country. Oregon\u00d5s rainy day reserves could fund 10.6% of the state\u00d5s expenditure for the 2018 fiscal year, one of the larger shares nationwide. Additionally, the state\u00d5s debt amounts to just 37.2% of total tax revenue, far less than the 52.2% average debt across all states. Oregon dedicates just 1.5% of its expenditure to interest payments on its small debt load, freeing the state to allocate more money to other public services. For example, Oregon spends 37.6% of its budget on public welfare, the fourth largest share of any state. Oregon also leads much of the nation in gender equality in political leadership. As of 2015, some 31% of Oregon legislators were female, far more than the 24% national average. Female lawmakers in the state have helped pass legislation expanding access to birth control in recent years. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 5. Washington 2016 Unemployment: 5.4% (9th highest) Pension funded ratio: 87.1% (10th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 11.3% (14th lowest) Ensuring state residents have adequate access to health care appears to be a priority for Washington. The state allocates 6.1% of its budget to health care spending, more than all but two other states and nearly double the U.S. average, and Washington is one of the 32 states to expand its Medicaid program. Partially as a result, only 6.0% of Washingtonians are without health insurance, well below the U.S. uninsured rate of 8.6%. Social safety nets do not stop at health care in Washington. The average weekly payout for unemployment insurance beneficiaries is $425, well above the $354 average across all states. In addition to providing health care and generous UI benefits, Washington has one of the best funded state pension systems in the country. Some 87.1% of the pension system is funded, far more than the 71.6% average across all states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 6. Nebraska 2016 Unemployment: 3.2% (5th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 91.3% (8th highest) Credit rating and outlook: N/A/Stable Poverty: 11.4% (15th lowest) Nebraska, now the sixth best run state in the country, has ranked among the top five in each of the previous six years. Nebraska is in a far better position financially than most states. The state has set aside a rainy day fund equal to 16.1% of its 2018 budget, partially to reduce the likelihood of future tax hikes. Nebraska\u00d5s rainy day fund as a share of its annual expenditures is nearly double the comparable average across all states and higher than that of all but six other states. Additionally, Nebraska\u00d5s debt accounts for only 15.9% of its total revenue, the second lowest debt-to-revenue ratio of any state. Not only is Nebraska in a better fiscal position than most states, but its job market is one of the healthiest in the country. Only 3.2% of the state\u00d5s labor force were out of a job in 2016, well below the 4.9% 2016 U.S. unemployment rate. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 7. North Dakota 2016 Unemployment: 3.2% (5th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 70.4% (22nd lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Negative Poverty: 10.7% (10th lowest) Breaking a five-year streak of ranking as the best run state in the country, North Dakota dropped this year to seventh overall. For much of the past decade, an oil boom led to economic growth and an explosion of jobs in the state. However, falling oil prices have contributed to state population and GDP declines over the past several years, and the effects of these declines were finally enough to push the state out of the No. 1 position. Still, North Dakota outranks most states in a number of key measures of government efficacy. Just 3.2% of the North Dakota workforce was unemployed in 2016, far less than the 4.9% national annual unemployment rate and the fifth smallest rate of any state. Moody\u00d5s rates North Dakota\u00d5s bonds a near-perfect Aa1 rating, citing the state\u00d5s \u00d2history of sound budget management\u00d3 and \u00d2strong reserves.\u00d3 However, Moody\u00d5s gave the state\u00d5s credit rating a negative outlook, suggesting a prolonged economic downturn could lead to a downgrade. If that happens, North Dakota might fall even further down the list in next year\u00d5s ranking. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 8. Idaho 2016 Unemployment: 3.8% (11th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 91.8% (7th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 14.4% (19th highest) Underfunded state pension systems are a major problem in the United States and could potentially affect millions of Americans who will be depending on state retirement benefits. Idaho is in far better shape than most states, however, as nearly 92% of its pension obligations are funded. In comparison, only about 72% of state pension systems are funded on average nationwide. While crime rates are subject to a range of factors outside of a state\u00d5s control, a low violent crime rate can be indicative of effective policing. There were only 230 violent crimes in Idaho for every 100,000 residents in 2016, one of the lowest violent crime rates among states and well below the violent crime rate nationwide of 386 per 100,000 Americans.

Colorado 2016 Unemployment: 3.3% (7th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 60.4% (8th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 11.0% (12th lowest) In the 12 months ending in July 2016, Colorado\u00d5s population grew by 1.1% due to net migration, nearly four times the national growth rate and among the most of any state. The rising population has led to increased housing demand and construction activity. Over the past year, the value of a typical home in Colorado rose 10.7%, from $283,800 to $314,200, the largest percentage increase of any state. Largely due to the increased residential construction, Denver is currently home to the third most cranes of any major city. Cranes are also being used in the construction of a number of mixed-use commercial developments. New residents are likely attracted by the large number of advanced, high-paying jobs the state has to offer. Some 14.0% of workers in Colorado are employed in professional, scientific, and management positions, the third largest share of any state. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 10. Hawaii 2016 Unemployment: 3.0% (3rd lowest) Pension funded ratio: 62.4% (11th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 9.3% (2nd lowest) The typical household in Hawaii earns $74,511 a year, nearly $17,000 more than the typical American household. With a strong tax base, the Hawaiian government brings in the equivalent of $4,540 a year in tax revenue per resident -- more than all but two other states. The high median income is partially attributable to the relative availability of jobs in the state. Only 3.0% of Hawaii\u00d5s labor force were out of work in 2016, nearly the lowest unemployment rate in the country. For those Hawaiians who are unemployed, the state has one of the most generous safety nets in the country. The average weekly payout for unemployment insurance recipients is $490, and 39% of unemployed state residents receive insurance benefits -- each among the highest such figures of any state. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 11. Texas 2016 Unemployment: 4.6% (23rd lowest) Pension funded ratio: 75.6% (22nd highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 15.6% (12th highest) Home to over a third of all U.S. crude oil reserves, Texas is a resource-rich state that leads the nation in oil production. Though oil prices have yet to recover from their precipitous fall in 2014, resource extraction remains a significant revenue source for the state government. In a better fiscal position than most states, Texas has the equivalent of more than a fifth of its annual budget saved in a rainy day fund, nearly triple the average among all states. Partially as a result, Texas is one of only 14 states with a perfect credit rating from Moody\u00d5s and a stable outlook. While a well-run government is not reason enough for Americans to choose to live in a given state, people are flocking to Texas. Due largely to inbound migration, the Lone Star State\u00d5s population expanded by over 430,000 between July 2015 and July 2016, more than any other state. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 12. Massachusetts 2016 Unemployment: 3.7% (10th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 62.0% (10th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 10.4% (9th lowest) Massachusetts is the best run state in New England, and the 12th best run state nationwide. Many states ranking on the better half of this list benefit from higher than typical tax revenue, and Massachusetts is no exception. The state collects the equivalent of $3,960 per resident annually in taxes, more than all but seven other states and well above the average across all states of $2,821. Despite the relatively high tax revenues, the state borrows heavily. Massachusetts\u00d5 debt amounted to $11,056 per person as of 2015, the most debt per capita of any state. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 13. South Dakota 2016 Unemployment: 2.8% (2nd lowest) Pension funded ratio: 104.1% (the highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 13.3% (24th highest) Tax codes and laws can have a considerable impact on a state\u00d5s economy and job market, and in South Dakota, only 2.8% of the labor force were out work in 2016, nearly the lowest unemployment rate of any state and less than half the 4.9% U.S. annual unemployment rate. Low unemployment can help generate more tax revenue for state coffers and one of a minority of states with a perfect credit rating and stable outlook from Moody\u00d5s, South Dakota is in a sound fiscal position. South Dakota also has one of the most stable housing markets of any state. As of 2015, just one of every 1,172 homes in the state were in some part of the foreclosure process, this is the second lowest foreclosure rate of any state and far below the national foreclosure rate of one in every 142 homes. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 14. California 2016 Unemployment: 5.4% (9th highest) Pension funded ratio: 74.0% (25th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa3/Stable Poverty: 14.3% (20th highest) The most populous state in the country, California might intuitively seem like the most difficult state to manage. Despite its size, California ranks better than most. Like most of the best run states, California has a solid tax base to draw from. The typical household in the state earns $67,739, about $10,000 more than the median income nationwide. Each year, the state brings in about $3,850 per resident in tax revenue, more than all but eight other states and about $1,000 more than is typical nationwide. California allocates a relatively large share of its budget to helping its neediest residents. Some 40.4% of state spending goes towards public welfare programs, the largest public welfare allocation in any state. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 15. Delaware 2016 Unemployment: 4.4% (21st lowest) Pension funded ratio: 89.3% (9th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 11.7% (16th lowest) Most of the best run states are in the West. Delaware, though, is the second highest ranking state on the eastern seaboard. One of only 14 states with a perfect credit rating and stable outlook from Moody\u00d5s, Delaware is a fiscally responsible state. The state\u00d5s rainy day coffers are worth about 11.1% of its annual budget, a larger share than the 8.2% average across all states. As is the case in many of the best run states, Delaware residents are relatively wealthy. The typical household in the state earns $61,757 a year compared to the $57,617 the typical American household earns nationwide. High incomes are driven in part by strong employment in sectors that tend to pay well. Some 8.9% of workers in the state are employed in the generally high-salaried finance and insurance sector, the largest share of any state. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 16. Michigan 2016 Unemployment: 4.9% (20th highest) Pension funded ratio: 63.7% (14th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 15.0% (15th highest) The best run states often have diverse economies and a relatively well-educated labor force. In Michigan, only about 28.3% of adults have a bachelor\u00d5s degree or higher, a smaller share than the 31.3% of American adults. Manufacturing jobs are less likely than others to require a college education, and Michigan\u00d5s manufacturing sector employs some 18.4% of the state\u00d5s labor force. Nationwide, manufacturing accounts for only 10.1% of total employment. Overdependence on a single industry can undermine economic resilience during downturns. Despite Michigan\u00d5s reliance on manufacturing, its 2016 unemployment rate of 4.9% was in line with the annual U.S. unemployment rate. The state\u00d5s housing market has also improved substantially in recent years after being hit particularly hard during the housing crisis. The median home value in the state rose by 27% between 2012 and 2016, one of the largest increases in the country. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 17. New Hampshire 2016 Unemployment: 2.8% (2nd lowest) Pension funded ratio: 65.5% (17th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 7.3% (the lowest) New Hampshire is one of only five states with no sales tax. Partially as a result, the state government has relatively limited financial resources. The state collects the equivalent of only $1,864 in tax revenue per resident a year, the second least of any state. New Hampshire is also saddled with considerable debt, owing $6,151 per resident, far more than the average state debt per capita of $3,559. With little tax revenue and heavy borrowing, New Hampshire is struggling to meet its financial obligations by several measures. For example, only 65.5% of state pensions are funded, below the 71.6% average funding across all states. Additionally, New Hampshire only has about 6.5% of its annual expenditure saved in a rainy day fund, compared to the 8.2% average rainy day savings across all states. A relative absence of serious financial hardship can be indicative of effective policies aimed at reducing poverty. New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate in the country, at only 7.3%. The state allocates 36.2% of its annual expenditures to public welfare, more than the average of 33.1% across all states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 18. Montana 2016 Unemployment: 4.1% (17th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 74.5% (25th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 13.3% (24th highest) Montana brings in some $2,727 in tax revenue per capita annually, roughly in line with the average across all states. Despite similar tax revenue, Montana may be underprepared to fund operations in the event of disrupted or diminished revenue streams. Montana has only 6.9% of its annual budget saved in a rainy day fund, a smaller share than the 8.2% average across all states. The small rainy day fund partially reflects the priorities of the government, as other spending categories may be taking precedence. For example, Montana allocates about double the average spending across states -- relative to their budgets -- to highways, natural resources, and government administration.The state\u00d5s pension system is also better funded than most. Montana has funding to back nearly three-quarters of its pension obligations, more than the average pension funding of 71.6% across all states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 19. Vermont 2016 Unemployment: 3.3% (7th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 67.8% (20th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 11.9% (19th lowest) Vermont ranked as the best run state in New England last year and the 14th best run in the country. This year, it ranks third in New England and 19th overall. Vermont\u00d5s drop in ranking this year may be due to its recent population decline, even as other states in the region have added residents. A fiscally responsible state, Vermont has earned the top credit rating from Moody\u00d5s with a stable outlook. While obtaining health insurance is often ultimately the responsibility of the individual, Vermont has taken steps to ensure its citizens have access to medical care. The state is one of 32 to have expanded Medicaid, and Vermont allocates 5.3% of its budget to health care spending, considerably more than the 3.4% average across all states. While the availability of jobs can be affected by forces outside the government\u00d5s control, the government can enact policies that attract companies and create jobs. A low unemployment rate can be indicative of sound policies. In Vermont, only 3.3% of the labor force was out of work in 2016, well below the comparable U.S. unemployment rate of 4.9%.

Wisconsin 2016 Unemployment: 4.1% (17th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 98.3% (2nd highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Positive Poverty: 11.8% (18th lowest) An underfunded pension system is a considerable problem in many states that could potentially affect millions of Americans. But Wisconsin is not one of them. Over 98% of Wisconsin\u00d5s pension system is funded, far more than the 72% average across all states. However, Wisconsin\u00d5s well-funded pension system is partially attributable to diminished collective bargaining rights for teachers in the state following the passage of Act 10 in 2011. Better ranked states often benefit from higher than typical tax revenue. Wisconsin brings in the equivalent of $2,945 a year per resident, roughly in line with average per capita tax revenue across all states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 21. Wyoming 2016 Unemployment: 5.3% (13th highest) Pension funded ratio: 73.1% (24th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: N/A Poverty: 11.3% (14th lowest) A resource-rich state, Wyoming\u00d5s economy is heavily dependent on energy production. Roughly 1 in every 10 workers in the state are employed in the agriculture and mining sector, the largest share of any state. While a heavy dependence on natural resources can make an economy overly vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations, taxes on resource extraction can be a boon for government balance sheets. Wyoming brings in the equivalent of about $4,000 a year per resident in tax revenue, more than all but five other states. A large portion of Wyoming\u00d5s tax revenue has been used to pad state coffers. A safeguard against increasing tax rates, Wyoming\u00d5s rainy day fund is one of only two nationwide worth more than the state\u00d5s entire annual budget. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 22. Florida 2016 Unemployment: 4.9% (20th highest) Pension funded ratio: 86.5% (11th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 14.7% (16th highest) One of only a handful of states with no individual income tax, Florida's tax revenue amounts to only $1,806 per person in annually, the least of any state. Despite its relatively limited financial resources, Florida\u00d5s standing on this list has improved considerably in recent years. Ranking among the 10 worst run states as recently as 2010, Florida now ranks in the top half of all states. While low taxes may make it more challenging to meet budget obligations, Florida\u00d5s tax climate also likely makes it a more attractive place to live for many Americans. The Sunshine State gained nearly 326,000 new residents in the 12 months between July 2015 and July 2016 due to migration alone, the largest such population increase among states.

North Carolina 2016 Unemployment: 5.1% (16th highest) Pension funded ratio: 95.5% (4th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 15.4% (13th highest) Overpromising and under delivering is a consistent theme across many state pension systems, but not in North Carolina. Nearly 96% of the state\u00d5s pension obligations have financial backing compared to only 71.6% of state pensions nationwide. Currently, North Carolina is one of few states with a perfect credit rating and stable outlook from Moody\u00d5s. North Carolina is one of several states not to take advantage of federal funds to expand its Medicaid program. Partially as a result, about 1 in every 10 state residents are uninsured, a larger share than in most states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 24. Tennessee 2016 Unemployment: 4.8% (25th highest) Pension funded ratio: 95.4% (5th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 15.8% (11th highest) With a perfect rating and stable outlook from Moody\u00d5s, Tennessee is a fiscally responsible state. It has the lowest debt per capita of any state and a nearly fully funded state pension system at a time when on average only 71.6% of state pensions are funded. The state also benefited from a near nation-leading economic growth in 2016 of 2.9%. Still, Tennessee is ill-prepared to meet its budgetary obligations in the event of falling tax revenue. The state only has the equivalent of 5.5% of its annual budget in a rainy day fund, well below the 8.2% average across all states. Tennessee is also not especially safe. There were 633 violent crimes in the state for every 100,000 people in 2016, the fourth highest violent crime rate in the country after only Alaska, Nevada, and New Mexico.

Georgia 2016 Unemployment: 5.4% (9th highest) Pension funded ratio: 80.9% (17th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 16.0% (10th highest) Georgia is one of the minority of states that did not take advantage of federal money and expand their Medicaid program. Medicaid is intended to help the poorest Americans obtain health care coverage, and Georgia has a larger population struggling financially than most states. Some 16.0% of people in Georgia live below the poverty line compared to 14.0% of Americans nationwide. Due in large part to its decision not to expand Medicaid, some 12.9% of state residents are uninsured, nearly the largest share of any state after only Alaska, Oklahoma, and Texas. While many in Georgia struggle financially, the state itself is fiscally sound. Georgia is one of only 14 states the highest rating from Moody\u00d5s and a stable outlook.

Maryland 2016 Unemployment: 4.3% (19th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 68.2% (21st lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 9.7% (3rd lowest) Maryland residents are wealthiest in the country, with a median household income of $78,945 a year, about $21,300 more than what the typical American household earns a year. With a strong tax base, the per capita tax revenue in Maryland tops $3,300 a year -- considerably more than the average tax revenue per capita across all states of $2,821. The high per capita tax revenue likely makes it easier for state officials to meet budgetary obligations, and Maryland is one of only 14 states to have a perfect credit rating and a stable outlook from Moody\u00d5s. However, even with such a healthy revenue stream, the state has not set aside much in the way of emergency resources. The state\u00d5s current rainy day fund is equivalent to just 5.6% of its annual expenditure. Nationwide, states have an average of 8.2% of annual expenditures set aside to close budget gaps.

Nevada 2016 Unemployment: 5.7% (8th highest) Pension funded ratio: 75.1% (23rd highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa2/Stable Poverty: 13.8% (23rd highest) Nevada is one of only a handful of states with no personal income tax. Partially as a result, the state has to operate with lower tax revenue than is typical. Nevada brings in about $2,562 per resident annually, a few hundred dollars less than the average revenue per capita across all states. Limited financial resources may make it more difficult for Nevada to meet its budgetary obligations. Currently, the state has a slightly smaller share of its annual expenditures saved in a rainy day fund. While crime rates are subject to a range of factors, effective policing can help reduce crime. Nevada allocates a slightly smaller share of its budget on police protection and correctional facilities than is typical. Greater budgetary emphasis on crime prevention may go a long way to reduce the state\u00d5s near-nation leading violent crime rate of 678 incidents per 100,000 people. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 28. Virginia 2016 Unemployment: 4.0% (15th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 74.6% (24th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 11.0% (12th lowest) Virginia\u00d5s annual tax revenue of only about $2,441 per resident is nearly $400 less than the average per capita revenue across all states. Additionally, Virginia has only 1.5% of its annual budget saved in a rainy day fund, one of the smallest such shares of any state. Despite relatively limited emergency funds and limited tax revenues, Virginia is one of only 14 states with a perfect credit rating and a stable outlook from Moody\u00d5s. As is the case in most states on the bottom half of this list, economic growth has been sluggish in Virginia. The state\u00d5s economy expanded by only 0.5% in 2016, one-third of economic growth nationwide the same year. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 29. Indiana 2016 Unemployment: 4.4% (21st lowest) Pension funded ratio: 64.6% (15th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 14.1% (21st highest) Like its neighbors Michigan and Ohio, Indiana is overly dependent on its once strong manufacturing sector. American manufacturing has been in decline for decades, and currently, some 18.8% of workers in Indiana are employed in manufacturing jobs, the largest share of any state. Over reliance on a single industry can make an economy more susceptible to economic downturns. Despite its dependence on manufacturing, Indiana\u00d5s economy appears to be stronger than most. Only 4.4% of the state\u00d5s labor force was out of a job in 2016, below the 4.9% U.S. annual unemployment rate. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 30. Maine 2016 Unemployment: 3.9% (13th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 82.5% (14th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa2/Stable Poverty: 12.5% (21st lowest) In keeping with the national trend, Maine\u00d5s unemployment rate is falling. In October 2016, 3.9% of the state\u00d5s workers were out of a job compared to only 3.5% as of October 2017. However, declining joblessness may not be solely the product of improving economic conditions as the size of the state\u00d5s labor force shrank by 1.2% over the last half decade. Like many states ranking low on this list, Maine is ill-prepared to meet budgetary obligations in the event of a dip in tax revenue. The state has the equivalent of only 5.8% of its annual budget saved in a rainy day fund, less than the majority of states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 31. Ohio 2016 Unemployment: 4.9% (20th highest) Pension funded ratio: 76.4% (21st highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 14.6% (18th highest) As evidenced by the high unemployment in the state and a shrinking labor force, Ohio\u00d5s economy is struggling. As of October, 5.1% of the state\u00d5s workforce was out of a job, slightly worse than the state\u00d5s October 2016 unemployment rate of 5.0% and a break from the national trend of an improving job market. Like many other states in the Midwest with flagging economies, Ohio is overly dependent on its once strong manufacturing sector. The industry, which has long been in decline in the United States, employs some 15.5% of Ohio\u00d5s workforce. In comparison, the manufacturing sector employs only 10.1% of workers nationwide. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 32. New York 2016 Unemployment: 4.8% (25th highest) Pension funded ratio: 98.1% (3rd highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 14.7% (16th highest) Lower-ranked states often have relatively little to work with in the way of tax revenue, but not New York. The state brings in the equivalent of $3,961 per resident a year, more than all but six other states. With strong revenue, New York is one of only a handful of states with a near fully-funded pension system. Despite the high tax revenues, New York borrows more than most states. New York\u00d5s debt is equal to nearly $7,000 per resident, the seventh highest debt per capita among states. New York also struggles more than most states with a weak job market. The state\u00d5s October 2017 unemployment rate of 4.8% is effectively unchanged from its October 2016 rate of 4.9%, even as the unemployment nationwide has decline to 4.1% from 4.8% over the same period.

Arizona 2016 Unemployment: 5.3% (13th highest) Pension funded ratio: 63.2% (12th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa2/Stable Poverty: 16.4% (8th highest) Arizona\u00d5s job market is hurting, and the state is doing relatively little to help those trying to find work. Some 5.3% of workers in the state were unemployed in 2016 compared to only 4.9% of the U.S. workforce. Of those in Arizona who are out of work, only 16.0% receive unemployment insurance compared to the UI recipiency rate nationwide of 27.0%. Most of those receiving UI benefits are likely still struggling financially. The average UI payout in Arizona covers less than one-quarter of the average working wage, the least generous proportional insurance payout of any state. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 34. South Carolina 2016 Unemployment: 4.8% (25th highest) Pension funded ratio: 57.8% (7th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 15.3% (14th highest) Some 15.3% of South Carolinians live below the poverty line compared to 14.0% of Americans. Medicaid is intended to help those facing serious financial hardship afford medical care, and despite standing to gain more than many states, South Carolina did not accept federal money to expand its Medicaid program. Partially as a result, 1 in 10 state residents do not have health insurance coverage, a larger share than in most states. Overall, the state\u00d5s neediest residents do not appear to be high up among the state's lawmakers\u00d5 priorities. South Carolina allocates 29.1% of its annual spending towards welfare programs compared to the average allocation across all states of 33.1%. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 35. Kansas 2016 Unemployment: 4.2% (18th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 64.9% (16th lowest) Poverty: 12.1% (20th lowest) Since Gov. Sam Brownback slashed income taxes in Kansas in 2012 and 2013, the state has struggled to balance its budget. State employee pensions have bared the brunt of much of the tax cuts. Only 64.9% the state's pension system is funded, compared to the 71.6% average funding across all state pension systems. Not only have the tax cuts made it difficult for Kansas to meet its budgetary obligations, but they have also failed to generate the growth Brownback expected. Economic output contracted by 0.9% in Kansas in 2016, even as GDP nationwide expanded by 1.5% over the same period. Despite the state\u00d5s fiscal troubles in recent years, Kansas\u00d5 job market is relatively strong. Only 4.2% of the state\u00d5s labor force was out of work in 2016 compared to 4.9% of U.S. workers. Charlie Riedel, AP \n\n None \n 36. Arkansas 2016 Unemployment: 4.0% (15th lowest) Pension funded ratio: 82.4% (15th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 17.2% (6th highest) Most states maintain a rainy day fund as a safeguard for meeting budgetary obligations in the event of falling tax revenue, but not Arkansas. The state is one of only two without any savings. The state also struggles more than most with serious crimes. There were 551 violent crimes in Arkansas for every 100,000 residents in 2016, more than in the vast majority of states and well above the U.S. violent crime rate of 386 per 100,000. While the prevalence of crime can be the result of a range of factors, it can also be indicative of ineffective policing and correctional facilities. Danny Johnston, AP \n\n None \n 37. Alaska 2016 Unemployment: 6.6% (2nd highest) Pension funded ratio: 67.5% (19th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa3/Negative Poverty: 9.9% (6th lowest) Crime rates are subject to a wide range of factors -- many of which are outside of the government\u00d5s control. Still, rampant crime can be indicative of ineffective policing and rehabilitation programs. Despite allocating larger than typical shares of its budget to law enforcement and correctional facilities, Alaska is the most dangerous state in the country. There were 804 violent crimes for every 100,000 state residents in 2016, more than double the 386 per 100,000 U.S. violent crime rate. An oil-rich state, Alaska has historically relied on tax revenue from resource extraction. Following the steep drop in oil prices in 2014, the state has struggled to balance its budget. Since the price plunge, lawmakers in Alaska have debated a range of options to meet budgetary obligations including drawing from the state\u00d5s Permanent Fund, cutting spending, and enacting an income tax. Currently, the state\u00d5s credit rating from Moody\u00d5s is less than perfect with a negative outlook. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 38. Connecticut 2016 Unemployment: 5.1% (16th highest) Pension funded ratio: 49.4% (4th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa3/Negative Poverty: 9.8% (4th lowest) Connecticut has fallen considerably on this list. Ranking 20th best as recently as 2010, Connecticut is now on the brink of making the 10 worst run states. Like many of the worst run states, Connecticut is losing residents. In the 12 months between July 2015 and July 2016, nearly 13,000 more people left Connecticut than moved in. Fewer residents means fewer taxpayers, and Connecticut is already borrowing heavily. The New England state\u00d5s debt is equal to nearly $10,000 per resident, more than nearly all states with the exception of Massachusetts, its neighbor to the north. The state\u00d5s budget problems do not stop with debt. Connecticut is one of only four states with just half of its pensions funded. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 39. Missouri 2016 Unemployment: 4.5% (22nd lowest) Pension funded ratio: 81.4% (16th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aaa/Stable Poverty: 14.0% (22nd highest) Government policies can have a considerable effect on the economy and can often either encourage or stifle growth. Missouri lawmakers may need to revisit the state\u00d5s economic policy as the state\u00d5s GDP expanded by only 0.3% in 2016, one-fifth of the nationwide economic growth of 1.5%. Despite the limited growth, joblessness is less of a problem in Missouri than it is in most states. The state\u00d5s unemployment rate fell from 4.6% in October 2016 to only 3.5% in October 2017. Missouri does not appear to prioritize access to health care for its neediest residents. The state is one of a minority of states to not accept federal funds to expand Medicaid. Partially as a result, some 8.9% of state residents are uninsured, a larger share than in most states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 40. Kentucky 2016 Unemployment: 5.0% (18th highest) Pension funded ratio: 37.8% (2nd lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa3/Stable Poverty: 18.5% (4th highest) While the availability of jobs is subject to a range of factors, including some outside of a government's control, a low unemployment rate can be indicative of sound economic policy. Kentucky\u00d5s October 2017 unemployment rate of 5.0% is well above the comparable 4.1% U.S. monthly unemployment rate. The state's unemployment is higher than average even as the labor force has shrunk. In the last half decade, the number of workers in Kentucky fell by 3.1%, nearly the largest decline of any state. Like many of the worst run states, Kentucky is failing to meet its pension obligations. Only 37.8% of the state\u00d5s pension system is funded, the second worst pension funded ratio among states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 41. West Virginia 2016 Unemployment: 6.0% (4th highest) Pension funded ratio: 76.9% (20th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa2/Stable Poverty: 17.9% (5th highest) West Virginia lost nearly 10,000 residents in the 12 months between July 2015 and July 2016, the steepest total population decline of any state other than Illinois. With a smaller tax base, the state\u00d5s budget will likely soon be feeling the squeeze. Just as the state struggles financially, many of its residents struggle as well. Some 17.9% of people in West Virginia live in poverty compared to 14.0% of Americans nationwide. West Virginia is the second largest coal-producing state in the country after Wyoming. Like many other resource-rich states, West Virginia\u00d5s economy is overly dependent on resource extraction and is vulnerable to industry downturns. Some 3.7% of West Virginia\u00d5s labor force is employed in the resource extraction sector, more than double the industry\u00d5s share of total employment nationwide. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 42. Oklahoma 2016 Unemployment: 4.9% (20th highest) Pension funded ratio: 79.2% (19th highest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa2/Negative Poverty: 16.3% (9th highest) Like many resource-rich states, Oklahoma\u00d5s revenue from resource extraction took a hit following the global plunge in oil prices in 2014. Falling oil prices compounded the state\u00d5s revenue problem that began when Gov. Mary Fallin slashed taxes in an attempt to make the state more business friendly. The state\u00d5s school and health care systems have bared the brunt of the diminished tax revenues. Oklahoma is also one of a minority of states to not take advantage of federal funds to expand Medicaid. Medicaid is intended to help those struggling financially access health care, and many Oklahoma residents are poor. Some 16.3% of state residents live on poverty level income compared to only 14.0% of Americans. Medicaid expansion would likely go a long way to reduce the state\u00d5s near nation-leading 13.8% uninsured rate. Brett Deering, for USA TODAY \n\n None \n 43. Illinois 2016 Unemployment: 5.9% (6th highest) Pension funded ratio: 40.2% (3rd lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Baa3/Negative Poverty: 13.0% (24th lowest) No state has a lower credit rating than Illinois, and for good reason. Decades of budgetary mismanagement left the state unable to pay for many services and pension obligations. After years of stalemate, the state has just passed a $36 billion budget, its first since 2015. Still, the state has some $64.2 billion in outstanding debt and $250 billion in pension obligations as state workers retire, only 40% of which are funded. Due to the state\u00d5s ongoing budget woes, Moody\u00d5s is threatening to further downgrade Illinois rating. Such a move would make Illinois the first and only state with a junk credit rating.

Rhode Island 2016 Unemployment: 5.3% (13th highest) Pension funded ratio: 57.1% (6th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa2/Stable Poverty: 12.8% (22nd lowest) Like most states in New England, Rhode Island has relatively high per capita tax revenue, but it still borrows heavily. The state collects the equivalent of $3,026 in taxes per resident annually, slightly more than typical. Still, the state is $9.0 billion in debt -- or about $8,500 per resident -- more than nearly all states' debt per capita with the exception of its neighbors Connecticut and Massachusetts. Currently, Rhode Island is facing the prospect of a $29.3 million budget shortfall in in 2017, almost entirely due to high social services spending. Many states have large rainy day funds to cover such budget shortfalls without raising taxes, but not Rhode Island. The state only has 5.2% of its annual spending saved in a rainy day fund, a smaller share than in the vast majority of states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 45. New Jersey 2016 Unemployment: 5.0% (18th highest) Pension funded ratio: 37.5% (the lowest) Credit rating and outlook: A3/Negative Poverty: 10.4% (9th lowest) Up until January, New Jersey will still led by one of the least popular politicians in the country. Earlier this year, Gov. Chris Christie had a 15% approval rating, the lowest of any governor in state history. Since Christie took office in 2010, New Jersey fell steadily in the ranks on this list from 21st best to 6th worst. The state\u00d5s credit rating has also been downgraded several times during Christie\u00d5s administration and currently has a negative outlook from Moody\u00d5s. As is the case in many of the worst run states, people are leaving New Jersey. Between July 2015 and July 2016, 16,704 more people moved out of the Garden State then came in, one of the largest population declines attributable to migration in the country. The dwindling tax base will do little to help the state\u00d5s budgetary woes. Currently, only 37.5% of the state\u00d5s pension obligations are funded, the largest funding gap of any state. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 46. Pennsylvania 2016 Unemployment: 5.4% (9th highest) Pension funded ratio: 55.8% (5th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa3/Stable Poverty: 12.9% (23rd lowest) Pennsylvania is one of only three states with no money saved to close budget gaps in the event of declining tax revenue. And this will likely be a problem in the coming years as the state\u00d5s tax base is eroding. Nearly 11,000 more people left Pennsylvania in 2016 than moved in. A dwindling population does little to spur economic growth. Pennsylvania\u00d5s GDP expanded by only 0.6% in 2016, even as the U.S. economy grew by 1.5%. The Keystone State\u00d5s need for improved economic conditions is more dire than most states' as evidenced by the relative the share of workers out of a job. Pennsylvania\u00d5s 5.4% unemployment rate is higher than the 4.9% U.S. rate and among the 10 worst of all states. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 47. Alabama 2016 Unemployment: 6.0% (4th highest) Pension funded ratio: 67.0% (18th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Stable Poverty: 17.1% (7th highest) Like many of the states ranking on the bottom half of this list, Alabama has a relatively limited budget to work with. The state collects an average of only about $2,000 per person per year in tax revenue, $800 less than is typical among states. Still, the state has a good credit rating. A relatively poor state, Alabama\u00d5s 17.1% poverty rate is higher than the rate in the vast majority of states. Alabama is one of a minority of states that did not take advantage of federal funds to expand Medicaid. Partially as a result, 9.1% of the state\u00d5s population is uninsured, more than the 8.6% U.S. uninsured rate. Many Alabama residents without health insurance are likely among the 17.1% living below the poverty line. The state also struggles with a weak job market. Alabama\u00d5s 2016 unemployment rate of 5.8% is much higher than the national annual rate of 4.9%, and is one of the highest of any state. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 48. Mississippi 2016 Unemployment: 5.8% (7th highest) Pension funded ratio: 61.8% (9th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa2/Negative Poverty: 20.8% (the highest) More than 1 in 5 Mississippi residents live in poverty, the largest share of any state. Despite apparent need, the state chose not to accept federal funds to expand its Medicaid program, a move that would have helped thousands of state residents access health care. Without the Medicaid expansion, 11.8% of state residents are uninsured -- more than in all but five other states. Per capita tax revenue in Mississippi is lower than in most states, and its tax base is eroding. Some 7,500 more people moved out of Mississippi than moved in between July 2015 and July 2016, even as the total U.S. population expanded by over 2.2 million people over the same period. A shrinking population also means a shrinking workforce. Over the last half decade, Mississippi\u00d5s labor force declined by 4.6%, the steepest drop among states. Even with fewer workers, many in the state\u00d5s labor force are struggling to find a job. Some 5.8% of the state\u00d5s workforce was unemployed in 2016, well above the comparable 4.9% U.S. unemployment rate. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 49. New Mexico 2016 Unemployment: 6.7% (the highest) Pension funded ratio: 70.6% (23rd lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa1/Negative Poverty: 19.8% (3rd highest) New Mexico is one of many struggling states with a dwindling tax base. Some 7,100 more people moved out of New Mexico than moved in between July 2015 and July 2016. In addition to a shrinking population, New Mexico\u00d5s labor force is also decreasing. The state\u00d5s labor force size fell by 0.3% in the last half decade. While a smaller workforce can often mean a lower unemployment rate, some 6.7% of workers in the state were out of a job in 2016, the highest annual unemployment rate among states. Economic growth would likely go a long way to reducing unemployment, yet New Mexico\u00d5s economy is stagnant. The state\u00d5s GDP grew by only 0.2% in 2016, even as the U.S. economy expanded by 1.5%. Thinkstock \n\n None \n 50. Louisiana 2016 Unemployment: 6.1% (3rd highest) Pension funded ratio: 63.3% (13th lowest) Credit rating and outlook: Aa3/Negative Poverty: 20.2% (2nd highest) Many of the worst managed states have relatively little revenue to work with. Louisiana is no exception. The state collects the equivalent of only $2,071 per person in tax revenue a year compared to the $2,821 per capita amount states collect on average. With low revenue, Louisiana struggles to save for unexpected budget shortfalls and fund its pension system. Louisiana\u00d5s rainy day fund is only worth about 3.0% of it annual budget and only 63.3% of the state\u00d5s pension system is funded, each among the smaller such shares among states. Joblessness is also a major problem in Louisiana, and the state offers little assistance to its out-of-work residents. Some 6.1% of Louisiana\u00d5s labor force was unemployed in 2016, the third highest unemployment rate in the country after only Alaska and New Mexico. Additionally, the average unemployment insurance payout covers less than a quarter of the typical weekly wage. Nationwide, unemployment insurance payouts cover over a third of the average weekly wage.

Photograph: Metropolitan police/PA\n\nThe police are investigating a new complaint of sexual assault against John Worboys, the black-cab rapist, it has been confirmed, as prison authorities moved him to a London jail ahead of his scheduled release.\nThe impact on Worboys\u2019 potential release is unknown but the move will give fresh hope to his victims that his release may be halted if he is arrested or charged in connection with a further offence.\nThe Metropolitan police said they were investigating an allegation made this month of a sexual assault 20 years ago. \u201cEnquiries by officers from the child abuse and sexual offences command are ongoing,\u201d the Met said in a statement.\nDetectives have already consulted lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service, the organisation responsible for authorising criminal charges in England and Wales, though this does not necessarily mean charges will follow. It is understood the CPS has provided \u201cearly investigative advice\u201d to the new police investigation into Worboys.\nOne of Worboys\u2019 victims, who has campaigned against his release and said she wants him excluded from Greater London if he is freed, said: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that another person has come forward. I\u2019m sure Worboys has many, many more victims. I hope now the Met will treat this extremely seriously and that more people might yet come forward. I\u2019d urge other victims to do so.\u201d\nRichard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer from Slater and Gordon, which represented 11 of Worboys\u2019 victims, added: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment while there is an ongoing investigation, but we would urge anyone with any information that may aid the criminal investigation to contact the police.\u201d\nIt emerged on Monday that Worboys had been moved from HMP Wakefield to HMP Belmarsh in south-east London. There had been calls to keep him out of the capital, where he carried out most of his attacks.\nThe justice secretary, David Gauke, promised MPs that the \u201cmost stringent licensing conditions\u201d would be placed on Worboys when he was released from prison and \u201cthe concerns of victims will be put at the heart of the process\u201d.\nIt is understood that Worboys\u2019 release from Wakefield would have been more conspicuous as it is a high-security prison, from which few inmates are directly released. Belmarsh is a mix of high security and a local prison with many daily releases.\nAt justice questions in the House of Commons, the Tory MP Zac Goldsmith pressed Gauke to \u201cassure us that he will do absolutely everything in his power to ensure that Worboys is released with strict licensing conditions that keep him out of Greater London\u201d.\nThe justice secretary said the precise conditions of his release would be decided at an operational level. \u201cBut let me reassure [Goldsmith] that nearly a fortnight ago I wrote to the relevant authorities stressing the needs to ensure that the concerns of victims are put at the heart of this process, and ensuring that the most stringent measures are taken in place in terms of conditions,\u201d he said.\nThe Parole Board is able to assess the continued risk posed by prisoners based on psychiatrist and prison guard reports at Parole Board hearings that take place around once a year for each offender. Some of the hearings are oral, some of them written.\nIn November, a three-person panel of the Parole Board directed the release of Worboys, following an oral hearing. He will be released back into society under strict monitoring on a licence period of at least 10 years.\nParole Board hearings are held in private and reasons for release are not made public, although a consultation is to be launched on how the body shares its decision-making with the public.\nThe Parole Board is an independent body and its recommendation for Worboys\u2019 release cannot be overturned by the Ministry of Justice.\nThere are examples of Parole Board decisions being challenged by judicial review in the courts, but only when the prisoner has been denied release.\nVictims of Worboys are pursuing a crowdfunded judicial review to challenge his release.

Information, provided by other media sources, could not be confirmed.\nStars dying without wills? It's a notion that's difficult to grasp, particularly when musicians' estates often continue to generate significant revenue after their deaths.\nYet in some cases, famous faces were just like a lot of us, and despite their millions, put shoring up their finances on the back burner. We don't know yet if Prince's reported $300 million estate will end up in probate court (his sister, Tyka Nelson, says he died without a will in place), but here's a look at celebrities who died without wills in place \u2013 and the fallout that ensued.\nMichael Jackson\nAge at the time of death: 50 \nFinancial status: Jackson's family initially thought he didn\u2019t have a will, and headed to court. Eventually, courtesy of his lawyers, a will surfaced, signed seven years before the pop star's death. Upon its discovery, mom Katherine Jackson withdrew her petition asking to be put in charge of her son's estate.\nJackson's will named the pop star's longtime attorney John Branca and music executive John McClain as administrators of the estate. Katherine Jackson was named as a permanent guardian to her son's three children, Prince Michael I, Paris and Prince Michael II. She was also named a beneficiary of a trust set up by her son. Singer Diana Ross was named a successor guardian for the children and their estates.\nBut it's not over. The Hollywood Reporter says that thanks to posthumous projects such as the 2009 documentary This Is It (which grossed $261 million), a Cirque du Soleil tribute plus albums, video games and other lucrative memorials, a possible billion-dollar IRS estate tax battle looms. As THR puts it, \"Now the IRS wants its share, claiming the value of Jackson's name and image upon death amounted to more than $434 million. The estate's own valuation? Just $2,105.\"\n\nAmy Winehouse\nAge at the time of death: 27\nFinancial status: The soulful Brit, who died in 2011 from alcohol poisoning, was thought to have a will, but ultimately did not. Winehouse's parents ended up inheriting her fortune, with the singer's father, Mitch Winehouse, acting as the administrator of her estate. It's notable that in Amy, the Oscar-winning documentary about the singer, Winehouse was shown to have a contentious relationship with her father. (Mitch Winehouse called the documentary \"misleading.\") Winehouse's estate totaled $4.66 million after debts and taxes, according to the Associated Press. Her ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, did not receive anything.\n\nBob Marley \nAge at the time of death: 36\nFinancial status: Here's a cautionary tale about estate planning: 30+ years after Marley's death, his heirs were still battling the singer's estate in court. Marley, who died of cancer in 1981, famously left no written will, and under Jamaican law his estate was to be divided among his wife and 11 children. That meant Marley's wife, Rita, received only 10 percent of his assets. After years of court battles, Rita and Marley's family was rewarded with a decision that they were entitled to Marley's name and likeness.\nMarley's estate has since aggressively defended commercial use of Marley's likeness, songs and intellectual property through the years. Five years ago the estate sued Richard Booker, Marley's half-brother, for giving Jamaican tours and coordinating music festivals in his brother's name. (The case was settled out of court.)\n\nJimi Hendrix \nAge at the time of death: 27\nFinancial status: Hendrix died in 1970 without a will. The fight over his estate went on for more than 30 years. The famed guitarist's siblings had been feuding since 2002, when their father, Al Hendrix, died and left Jimi's sister Janie in control of the musician's $80-million estate. The Washington State Supreme Court upheld the will but the siblings continued battling over the use of the singer's image. According to Rolling Stone, a settlement was finally reached before a scheduled July 2015 jury trial to determine how much Hendrix Licensing, a company run by brother Leon's business partner, owed to the Jimi Hendrix estate in terms of damages for sales of unauthorized merchandise.\n\nSonny Bono\nAge at the time of death:  62\nFinancial status: Bono's death came as a shock: the entertainer-turned-congressman died in a skiing accident in 1998. His wife, Mary Bono, had to go through probate court to become the executor of her husband's estate. A love child also appeared (but later withdrew his claim). Ultimately, Bono\u2019s estate was divided between Mary Bono (who became his political successor for 14 years), and his two children, Chaz Bono and Christy Bono Fasce.\n\nKurt Cobain\nAge at the time of death: 27\nFinancial status: When Cobain died, he left behind a fortune that was estimated in the millions. In recent years, the estimated value has been in excess of $450 million. After the singer's death in 1994, wife Courtney Love was the primary beneficiary of the publishing rights to his estate, which included almost all of Nirvana's music, reports CNBC. In 2010, the couple's then-18-year-old daughter, Frances Bean, took control of her trust fund which was more than a third of the estate. That same year, Love gave up rights to Cobain's name and likeness for a loan, according to CNBC.\nCONNECTTWEET 67 LINKEDINEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Sz2E8M"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article discusses celebrity estates, wills, legal and financial fallout after death.

He got hit with a shot and then he'd start to retreat. When Lamont held his ground and start inching forward, I said, 'let's hunt him down. Controlled aggression.' And then when he got to him, definitely the 11th and 12th round I told him we need both of them and we need them big, and he delivered.\"\nStill, it wasn't enough. Two judges gave Peterson four of the last five rounds, and one gave Peterson all five, but Garcia held on to his perfect record, defeating Peterson by majority decision before a raucous crowd of 12,300 in NBC's second nationally televised fight card. It couldn't have been much closer. Two judges scored it 115-113 for Garcia, while the third had it 114-114.\n\"It was a tough, competitive fight, just like any other fight at this level,\" Garcia said. \"He moved, he came at me at the end, but I found a way to win, just like I always do.\"\nIt was the second Prime Boxing Champions series card on NBC, and like the first one, gave the fans their money's worth.\nAsked if it was his toughest fight to date, Garcia said, \"I've been in some tough fights where I've faced some adversity before, and he came on strong at the end. But you know, every fight's a learning experience for me. So it's just another tough fight in my career.\"\nGarcia became frustrated early on as he tried to press the action, but Peterson avoided many of the shots, moving and dancing around the ring, exhibiting outstanding footwork and quickness. At one point Garcia looked at Peterson and gestured with his gloves as if to say, \"Come on, let's fight.\"\nEventually, Peterson did just that and appeared to control the action in the later rounds, going to Garcia's body often.\nThe fight was fought at a catch weight of 143 pounds, and Garcia's junior welterweight titles were not on the line.\nThe Philadelphia fighter nicknamed \"Swift\" improved to 30-0 with 17 KOs, while Peterson, from Washington, D.C., lost for the third time. His record stands at 33-3-1, also with 17 KOs.\n\"That was a war. That's what the fans want to see,\" Garcia said. \"He stuck to his game plan and moved a lot. I was really prepared. I thought it was close, I'm not going to lie, but I think I had the edge.\"\nHunter didn't think so. He said of Garcia, \"There was love before and there will be love after. He did what he had to do. I just think the judges need to be better judges.\"\nGarcia, who has won two of his last three fights by majority decision, said he believed he had to move up to welterweight because \"it's affecting my performance.\"\nGarcia threw 589 punches and landed 173, while Peterson threw nearly a hundred fewer but connected on 170, or 34%. Garcia had a decisive edge in power punches landed, 147 to 105.\nAsked if he wanted Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao next, Garcia said he needed to get in a couple fights at 147 pounds before he could think about either one.\nGarcia earned $1.5 million for his night's work, while Peterson took home $1.2 million.\n\"I did my part. I'm not calling it a robbery but it was a good fight,\" said a disappointed Peterson. \"I don't expect an easy journey for me to get where I'm going. I feel great. That's probably the least contact I've ever had in a fight.\"\nGarcia did not rule out a rematch.\nIn the co-main event, WBO middleweight champion Andy Lee and challenger Peter Quillin fought to a draw.\nQuillin started off strongly, knocking Lee down twice in the first three rounds. But then he faded some in the late rounds.\nLee's title was not on the line after Quillin missed weight on Friday and the Brooklyn resident, who walked to the fight from his home a few blocks from Barclays Center, had to forfeit $125,000 of his $500,000 purse to Lee. But even if there had been a belt to fight for, Lee would have kept it because the champion keeps his belt in the event of a draw.\n\"The weight's not coming off as easy as it used to,\" Quillin said afterward, though he says he worked as hard as ever coming into the fight. \"I'm 32 this year, and I've been fighting middleweight since I was 21. My body's going through changes.\"\nQuillin said he will take a little time and talk to his team, but there's a good chance he could move up to 168 pounds. \"I'm just taking it one day at a time,\" he said.\nLee, from Ireland, almost didn't make it out of the first round. He was knocked down after a hard right by Quillin, then nearly hit the canvas again as the bell rang, as his legs wobbled precariously.\nLee went down again in the third round, but seemed to gain strength as the fight wore on. Quillin, meanwhile, after a strong start, began to lose steam in the later rounds, giving Lee time to regain his legs and win rounds.\n\"It was a tough fight,\" Lee said. \"He dropped me early because I was being lazy. I got my momentum late in the fight and I boxed consistently. I understand why with two knockdowns people felt he won the decision. I could have done better tonight.\" \nQuillin went down in the seventh round for the following a left and a right by Lee, who outworked \"Kid Chocolate\" in the late rounds to gain the draw.\n\"There's a reason why judges are judges.

Credit Tyler Hicks/The New York Times\n\nSUNDAY\u2019S PUZZLE \u2014 I\u2019ve written a few times about the Extremely Spunky Border Terrier who lives with me as the brains behind the Wordplay organization, and it\u2019s rare to find someone who loves dogs even more than I do. I think I\u2019ve finally met my match in Elayne Boosler.\nMs. Boosler is known to us as a very funny comedian, yet she is so much more. In the 1980s, she successfully financed her own special at a time when women were not able to secure comedy specials on cable television, blowing the doors open for female comedians on cable TV. She has performed for people as varied as former president Bill Clinton and Queen Elizabeth II of England, and she has moderated a Democratic presidential candidates debate on C-SPAN for the National Organization for Women. Nearest to her heart, I believe, is her passion for promoting animal adoption, which primarily manifests itself in her activity with Tails of Joy, a nonprofit organization that raises funds for rescuers all over the country and beyond. Ms. Boosler is appearing as a regular on John Fugelsang\u2019s Current TV show, \u201cViewpoint.\u201d\nElayne Boosler\u2019s Notes\nI see \u201cSoft T\u2019s\u201d and my head takes off: \u201cWhat\u2019s the formula? TH\u2019s? Missing T\u2019s? Soft tease \u2014 Gypsy Rose Lee? Softees \u2014 Snuggle Bear, Pillsbury Dough Boy, tissues, Mr. Softee, your grandma?\u201d If it wasn\u2019t The New York Times, it might be actresses who haven\u2019t had implants. I always try to figure out the formula before looking at any clues. It\u2019s hard enough to write good jokes, but to construct a crossword containing twisted punch lines that surprise and delight, well, mad props. Any time I don\u2019t see the end of a joke coming, I doff my cap. Doff is such a crossword word, isn\u2019t it? \nYou can also usually count on STEN, E.L.O., ENO (the most famous musician in crossword history after ONO), either SSE or NNW (I\u2019m never good with directions), some state south or east of some other state, NONA Hendryx instead of Jimi, and either ETA or ETD. If they sold little crossword survival kits, those words would be included, along with coffee, a pen, and noise-canceling headphones. I can\u2019t work a crossword with any media on in the background. I can\u2019t come up with words while hearing words.\nWhat I enjoyed about solving this puzzle was of course the wordplay of the\u201dth\u201ds for \u201ct\u201ds, as I\u2019m a huge mangled language fan. Blame the Marx Brothers. I loved how beautifully the puns lent themselves to the clues. Once I \u201cgot\u201d the formula, I had a lot of fun guessing the answers before checking the clues that led to them. I left four blank squares in this puzzle, as I don\u2019t know who Athena turned into a spider (ARACHNE) crossing a central Swiss canton (URI), though I feel I should. I\u2019m thinking by next Wednesday I will come back and just be able to write them in.\nI\u2019ve been in about 45 newspaper crossword puzzles, mostly The New York Times. \u201cFunny Boosler.\u201d I don\u2019t flatter myself that it\u2019s anything more than the puzzle creators trying to dupe the public with my \u201cY,\u201d as opposed to Ela-I-ne. I\u2019ll take it, although on the last International Women\u2019s Day I was crossed by Golda Meir. Friends will excitedly say, \u201cWow!! You\u2019re 18 down!!\u201d But I know in my heart of hearts, real fame will only come when one day, the puzzle says, \u201c62 Across. See 18 Down.\u201d \nYears ago, I was negotiating to be in a Broadway show. We were far apart on money, when the big New York producer said to me, \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t really even know who you are.\u201d That Sunday, I was in the New York Times crossword puzzle. I got the salary I asked for. I may owe you guys a commission. \nTwo years ago, I was having eye surgery. I was terrified. That morning I was in the New York Times crossword puzzle. I brought it into surgery and wrote across the top, \u2018Dear Dr. Devgan, please take very good care of 22 Across.\u201d He was delighted. I can see!\nI absolutely love crosswords, Scrabble, word puzzles. My husband\u2019s \u201cone night off from the marriage\u201d list is Claudia Schiffer. Mine is Will Shortz. And Sandy Koufax, but I digress.\nI\u2019m dyslexic. As a child riding in the car, I spelled my first word like this: \u201cBar. R-A-B. Bar.\u201d I can sing backwards any song you can name, which once came in very handy while speaking to an assembly of fifth graders who wanted none of me until I had them shout out songs, after which they wouldn\u2019t let me go. I see everything backwards first, I can write upside down and backwards. I speak French, which means that my travel days are filled with French words backwards and forwards, followed by their English counterparts in every direction, after which they become the jumble, which I also do in my head without pen nor paper. Every day in Europe is exhausting for me. Rodney Dangerfield used to say to me, \u201cYou have a very busy head.\u201d\nFor me, every crossword starts the same way. I look at 1 Across and then I do 1 \u2013 4 or 5 Down in my head and so on, all through the puzzle. I use a pen and don\u2019t write anything down until I am sure of at least one solid letter. I love that when you\u2019ve done all you possibly can, and finally walk away, your brain keeps quietly working on it, so that when you come back hours later you can just fill it all right in. I love that our brains quietly go about solving our problems while we consciously tend to other things. I\u2019ve also learned to accept imperfection, as in, there is usually one square in the puzzle that will remain blank. Whether it\u2019s the second letter down of the blood of the Greek gods, or the second letter across of arsenic (rat\u2019s bane), I never look words up. I accept that life is never neatly finished, that nothing is perfect, that things don\u2019t always fit, that you can always be better, that there is something to come back for. Of course I\u2019d rather solve it. \nWhat a great philosophy. Thanks for stopping by, Ms. Boosler. Let\u2019s let Ms. Boosler take us to the Monday puzzle with her fabulous routine about her beloved dogs:\nYour thoughts?"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article is a human-interest piece about comedian Elayne Boosler, crossword puzzles, and animal adoption; it does not report on scientific studies, research methods, or findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_29"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "3694.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["James Dolan looking to sell New York Liberty after 21 years"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The New York Liberty are for sale.\nOne of the WNBA's original franchises, the Liberty have been owned by James Dolan and Madison Square Garden since the league was founded in 1996 and started play the next year.\n\"We have been a strong and vocal advocate for the Liberty and the WNBA since the beginning,\" Dolan, executive chairman and CEO of the Garden, said in a statement Tuesday. \"As the last original owner, I am proud of how far the league has come, and the role we have played in its growth.\nThis is the second WNBA franchise to put up for sale in the past few months. San Antonio was bought by MGM Resorts International and the team was moved to Las Vegas.\nThat franchise will begin play next season and is coached by Bill Laimbeer, who left the Liberty last month. New York promoted assistant coach Katie Smith to the head job.\nWhile all of the eight original WNBA franchises were owned and affiliated with NBA teams, only three of the 12 teams now have NBA partners \u2014 Indiana, Phoenix and Minnesota.\n\"The Liberty is a WNBA original with a history of great players and fans,\" WNBA President Lisa Borders said. \"We thank MSG for its 21 seasons supporting the growth of women's basketball and appreciate its dedication to find a new ownership group to build on the team's successes for many seasons to come.\"\nNew York has reached the playoffs in 15 of its 21 seasons but has never won the title. It has had the best record in the Eastern Conference the past three seasons.

Thomas is a former Knicks president and coach and his move to the WNBA came against a contentious backdrop of his time with the NBA club.\nTen years ago, while the Knicks coach, a jury ruled Thomas sexually harassed a former team executive, and the Garden improperly fired her. A court ordered the Knicks and Dolan to pay $11.6 million, with the settlement at $11.5 million. In 2015, the WNBA and Liberty suspended Thomas' bid for partial ownership of the Liberty.\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The slide came amid multiple investigations of the company's drug pricing and marketing practices, as well as allegations about Valeant's since-cancelled distribution deal with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services.\nValeant shares (VRX) surged after CEO Joseph Papa issued a statement announcing \"a new strategic direction\" that \"at its heart has a mission to improve patients' lives and will involve reorganizing our company and reporting segments.\"\n\"Although it will take time to implement and execute our turnaround plan, I am confident that we will show progress in the coming quarters,\" said Papa, who succeeded former CEO J. Michael Pearson in May.\n\nValeant reaffirmed its full-year guidance after a series of earlier cuts. The company projected 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $6.60 to $7, and total revenue of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion. If met, the projections would keep the company from violating its debt covenants.\nThe company also said that it had reached a deal to sell its North American sales rights to a drug called Ruconest to Pharming Group for up to $125 million.\nThat deal is part of recent steps to offload certain intellectual property totaling upfront payments of $181 million and up to $329 million in potential additional capital based on certain benchmarks.\nAt the same time, Valeant signaled plans to cut more than $5 billion from the company's $30.7 billion in long-term debt over the next year and a half.\nIn a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Papa said Valeant had stabilized turnover in its sales force and is moving forward with the second phase of a branded prescription distribution agreement with pharmacy giant Walgreens.\nValeant is also examining a potential reformulation of its top-selling drub Xifaxan, a medication that treats irritable bowel syndrome, \"to improve the customer experience,\" Papa said.

But there are differences lingering beneath the smiles and handshakes, including over Washington's alliance with Qatar, which is being boycotted by the UAE and three other Arab nations.\nRyan said the nuclear deal should remain in place, but that more economic sanctions should be imposed to counter the \"Iranian threat.\" He pointed to Iran's ballistic missiles and its \"land bridge\" to Syria, where it has provided crucial military and economic support to President Bashar Assad.\n\"This is an existential threat to you, it is an existential threat to Saudi Arabia,\" the Wisconsin Republican told an audience at the Emirates Diplomatic Academy in Abu Dhabi, the day after his delegation visited Saudi Arabia and met with its king.\n\"I want you to know that we see this issue the same way that you do,\" he said. \"Let me be clear: Congress will not repeat the mistakes of the past.

The UAE also has purchased billions in American armaments, including the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD.\nThe UAE is also a key member of the Saudi-led coalition at war with Yemen's Houthi rebels. The U.S., which is providing some support to the coalition, and its Arab allies accuse Iran of providing increasingly sophisticated weapons to the Shiite rebels, including a ballistic missile fired at the Saudi capital on Nov. 4. Iran denies arming the Houthis.\nThe war has been locked in a stalemate for most of the last three years, with more than 10,000 civilians killed, many in Saudi-led airstrikes using American armaments. Ryan did not mention the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which the U.N. has described as the worst in the world.\nThe U.S. is still waging a longstanding campaign of drone strikes targeting suspected members of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. A January 2017 raid ordered by Trump killed a U.S. Navy SEAL and 30 other people, including women, children and an estimated 14 militants.\n\"You fight this battle every single day against al-Qaida in Yemen,\" Ryan said. \"You understand firsthand why we must take these threats very seriously.\"\nNo one mentioned Qatar at Thursday's event.\nThe U.S. ally has faced a boycott since last June by the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia over allegations it supports extremists and maintains too-close ties to Iran.\nQatar, which has supported Islamists who the UAE views a threat to its system of hereditary rule, denies backing extremists. It also shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Iran and has increasingly relied on Iranian airspace for flights of its state carrier Qatar Airways.\nQatar hosts some 10,000 American soldiers at the al-Udeid Air Base, which hosts the forward operating base of the U.S. military's Central Command.\nAl-Otaiba, who had his personal emails hacked and released publicly during the Qatar crisis, has been a vocal critic of Doha. He's also suggested U.S. forces relocate from al-Udeid to somewhere else, perhaps the UAE, but did not offer that suggestion publicly Thursday.\n___\nFollow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

And it argued that the disparities could only be explained, at least in part, by unlawful bias and stereotypes against African Americans.\n The disparities were rooted in the city's reliance on the police department and courts for local budget revenue: Federal officials found that city officials worked together at every level of enforcement \u2014 from city management to the local prosecutor to the police department \u2014 to make as much money from fines and court fees as possible, ranging from schemes to raise total fines for municipal code violations to asking cops to write as many citations as possible.\n The report noted that, although black people made up about 67 percent of Ferguson's population, 88 percent of documented uses of force by Ferguson police from 2010 to August 2014 were against African Americans. In the 14 police canine bite cases for which racial data was available, the people bitten were black.\n There were similar racial disparities in traffic stops. From 2012 to 2014, 85 percent of people stopped, 90 percent of people who received a citation, and 93 percent of people arrested were black. Black drivers were more than twice as likely as their white counterparts to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26 percent less likely to have contraband.\n Some people's interactions with police turned downright abusive, as the report described:\nWe spoke with one African-American man who, in August 2014, had an argument in his apartment to which FPD officers responded, and was immediately pulled out of the apartment by force. After telling the officer, \"you don't have a reason to lock me up,\" he claims the officer responded: \"N*****, I can find something to lock you up on.\" When the man responded, \"good luck with that,\" the officer slammed his face into the wall, and after the man fell to the floor, the officer said, \"don't pass out motherf****r because I'm not carrying you to my car.\"\nThe Justice Department also exposed at least seven racist jokes police and court officials exchanged over email, all of which were sent by employees and were apparently sent during work hours. One of the emails, from November 2008, said President Barack Obama won't be president for long because \"what black man holds a steady job for four years.\"\n The Justice Department found no evidence that any of the police and court officials who engaged in these emails were ever disciplined, although the officials involved lost their jobs after the investigation's findings were released. The investigation also found no indication that any official asked the sender to stop sending such emails, or any proof that the emails were reported. \"Instead, the emails were usually forwarded along to others,\" the report stated.\n The emails show, as the Justice Department suggested, that at least some of the racial disparities in local law enforcement can be explained by outright racism.\nCard 7 of 10\n Who is Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Michael Brown?\nCard 8 of 10\n When can police officers use force?\nCard 9 of 10\n What happened in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting and grand jury decision?\nCard 10 of 10\n Why did police have military-grade equipment in the first place?"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article summarizes a Department of Justice investigative report and news coverage of policing, racial bias, and the Ferguson protests.

John McCain, Pope Francis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, China, Japan, The New York Times, fellow billionaire Mark Cuban and, as of Sunday morning, Saturday Night Live.\nConspicuously absent from the list: Russia and its remorselessly autocratic and self-aggrandizing leader, Vladimir Putin. For reasons that are mystifying to national security experts, fellow politicians and U.S. allies, Trump continues to defend both.\nAt the presidential debate on Oct. 9, just two days after national intelligence director James Clapper formally accused Russia of hacking into computers at the Democratic National Committee, Trump asserted there was no evidence that Russia was involved. He even questioned whether any hacking had taken place.\nAlso in the debate, and on many other occasions, Trump defended Russia\u2019s actions in Syria even as it unleashes a torrent of carnage and supports the bloodthirsty regime of President Bashar Assad. Trump defends this position by saying that Russia is killing Islamic State terrorists. The main problem with this argument is that Russian forces are killing other opponents and innocent civilians at a much faster clip.\n\nSince receiving the Republican nomination, Trump has received two national security briefings. Almost certainly, these included assessments of Putin\u2019s sinister actions and intentions. Yet Trump continues to be an apologist for Putin. What gives?\nNo one besides Trump seems to know for sure, but among the plausible explanations:\nHe might have undisclosed financial interests that depend of the backing of the Russian government. Trump's tax returns could shed light on whether this is the case, but he refuses to release them.\nHis foreign policy is based on a calculus of pure vanity \u2014 namely, that he supports people who compliment him, as Putin has, and attacks those who criticize him.\nHe genuinely admires Putin's authoritarian-thug approach to leadership and sees him as a model for his own governance, should he be elected.\nTo just about everyone except Trump, Putin presents a clear threat to the security of America and its allies. His goal is to destabilize Western Europe while reassembling much of the old Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact alliances to their former glory. He has systematically quashed dissent at home, and hackers associated with his regime appear to be engaged in an unprecedented effort to tamper with U.S. elections.\nTrump's latest reckless ramblings about the elections being \"rigged\" by the news media and at the polls play right into the Kremlin's effort to undermine faith in the legitimacy of American democracy. If Trump can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, see the problem that Russia poses for the United States, he has no business being the nation's commander in chief.\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Officials said that Russell called her husband when she saw his photograph on television \u2014 following the FBI\u2019s release of the pictures of the suspects \u2014 but did not notify authorities.\nOne of the key questions for investigators is whether the radical Islamist materials on Russell\u2019s computer belonged to her or were downloaded by her husband or someone else.\nRussell\u2019s attorney, Amato DeLuca, did not return phone calls seeking comment. \nDeLuca had previously said his client played no role in the plot and was shocked to learn of the involvement of her husband and brother-in-law.\nTamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed during a confrontation with police four days after the bombing, died from gunshot wounds and blunt trauma to his head and torso, according to Peter Stefan, the funeral home owner who is preparing his body for burial. Stefan read details from the death certificate, which lists Tsarnaev\u2019s time of death as 1:35 a.m. on April 19, the Associated Press reported. During the gunfight, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, driving a stolen sport-utility vehicle, ran over his brother and dragged his body under the vehicle.\nIn another development, federal agents, state troopers and local law enforcement officers scoured a wooded area near Dartmouth, Mass., where Dzho\u00adkhar Tsarnaev attended college. Investigators are looking for evidence that might indicate the brothers tested explosives there, according to a law enforcement official. People who live nearby reported hearing loud noises coming from the woods on March 30.\nJason J. Pack, an FBI spokesman, said the Dartmouth search, in which explosives-sniffing dogs were used, was part of the continuing investigation into the bombings.\nOn Monday, FBI special agents spent about 90 minutes inside the North Kingstown, R.I., home of Russell\u2019s parents, where she has been staying. \nLaw enforcement officials said several \u201cpersons of interest\u201d in the United States and Russia are being investigated in connection with the brothers. One of the primary focuses remains the seven months that Tamerlan Tsarnaev spent in strife-torn regions of southern Russia last year.\nDuring 16 hours of questioning in the hospital by the FBI, the younger Tsarnaev told agents that he and his brother initially considered carrying out suicide bombings and executing their plot on the Fourth of July at Boston\u2019s large celebration along the Charles River, two law enforcement officials said.\nBut Tsarnaev said that he and his brother decided to launch their attack earlier because they were able to assemble the bombs in three or four days, more quickly than they had expected, according to two law enforcement officials.\nOfficials have expressed skepticism about Tsarnaev\u2019s account, saying that the complexity of the bombs makes it unlikely that the brothers could have completed them as fast as he claimed.\nAccording to a government document obtained by NBC News, a detailed analysis of the bombs used at the Boston Marathon and pipe bombs allegedly thrown at police from a car by the Tsarnaevs during a gunfight four days later show striking similarities to instructions from Inspire magazine.\nThe report from the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center said that the design of the pressure-cooker bombs and the pipe bombs resembled instructions provided in an article in the first issue of Inspire headlined \u201cMake a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\u201d\nThe pressure-cooker bombs had different triggers and power sources than the Inspire designs, but they matched the magazine instructions in the use of several components, including gunpowder from fireworks, according to the TEDAC analysis.\n\u00a9 The Washington Post Company"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article reports on a criminal investigation into the Boston Marathon bombing and focus on the suspect's widow, citing law enforcement details and forensic leads; it does not discuss scientific research, studies, or academic findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_40"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "3492.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["5 reasons the Cavaliers won't make the NBA Finals this year"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["shares \n share \n tweet \n pin \n sms \n send \n email \nYes, it\u2019s only January 24.

Here are a few reasons why:\n1. There\u2019s too much locker room drama\n\n(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\nPoor Kevin Love. Even though he said everyone was a target in the now-infamous meeting, the reports said the forward was questioned about how legitimate his recent illness was. That\u2019s unsettling to say the least \u2014 finger-pointing is never a good thing, particularly for a team that\u2019s in a funk and needs to dig itself out.\n2. The defense can\u2019t stop anybody\nTheir 109.6 points allowed per game is the second-worst in the East, just 0.7 ppg fewer than what the Magic allows. Earlier this week, USA TODAY Sports took a deep dive into the numbers and found this:\nThe Cavs:\nHave given up 893 transition points, which ranks 27th. They were 26th last season and 12th in 2015-16.\nAre the worst team in the league when it comes to defending the roll man in pick-and-roll defense, allowing 1.22 points per possession.\nRank a middle-of-the-road 17th in isolation defense.\nRank 23rd in three-point defense and 25th in points allowed in the paint.\nThat\u2019s awful, and part of the problem is the Cavaliers\u2019 advanced age. It\u2019s also a roster filled with players not known for prowess on the defensive end, save for Jae Crowder. Which brings us to \u2026\n3. There isn\u2019t an easy fix to solve their woes\nThere\u2019s serious talk about the Cavs\u2019 acquiring guard George Hill from the Kings. It\u2019s a good idea \u2014 he\u2019s a solid backcourt defender. But is he really the name that will turn this team around enough to plow through fellow East contenders? Probably not. Acquiring DeAndre Jordan from the Los Angeles Clippers is similarly intriguing, but again, is that really a cure-all? It\u2019s not. Plus, do the Cavs have enough trade chips to make a deal for him? Or for both defenders?\n4. LeBron possibly leaving looms\n\nDavid Richard-USA TODAY Sports\nThat\u2019s where things get complicated. It\u2019s not like James leaving is on the minds of his teammates when they\u2019re on the court. But it hampers the way the franchise could save this situation. They could take that uber-valuable Brooklyn Nets pick they own and trade it for a big star to pair with James, but what\u2019s the point in doing that if the MVP candidate packs up and leaves this summer? At the same time, the Cavs have to leave open the possibility that James might stay, so they might have to appease him by finding some help on the trade market. It\u2019s NBA purgatory!\n5.

He was the one telling the supporters to do what they needed to to get them out of here,\" Havers said. \"We want an apology from Donald Trump himself. We want him to sit down with us and explain why he did what he did and why's he's going around the country spewing hatred and racism.\"\nSouthall said he intends to press charges against those who assaulted him at the event, and said the police officers who escorted him out of the event at no point asked him if he wished to do so. He also said they did not offer medical attention.\n\"They were too busy trying to get me the f--- out of there. They weren't trying to be nothing but just getting me the f--- out of there. That was their whole concern,\" Southall said of the police officers who escorted him out of the event several minutes into the altercation between Southall and the half-dozen attendees.\nBirmingham Police Lt. Sean Edwards, the department's public information officer, told CNN on Saturday that Southall did not require medical attention and did not ask to press charges.\n\n 'Black lives matter' protests \n\nEdwards said the department tried to contact him later Saturday at several numbers but could not reach him.\nEdwards said his officers \"didn't see\" the violent confrontation take place, but said Southall is welcome to file a police report and press charges.\n\"I would be a little cautious with Mercutio Southall,\" Edwards added. \"He has been an agitator from day one. Mercutio is always the agitator.\"\nSpeaking on the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly touted his strong relationship with minorities, from Hispanics to African-Americans -- noting that he is assured victory in the general election if he can win the African-American vote.\nBut Trump's controversial comments about racial and religious minorities -- from Hispanics to, more recently, Muslims -- have strained his relationship with people of color.\nTrump kicked off his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally \"criminals\" and \"rapists\" and lately has said he would either shut down or launch surveillance operations targeting mosques, and has appeared open to establishing a database for all Muslims in the U.S.\nSouthall, a father to three sons, said he was disheartened by the experience and said he hoped publicity around the incident could help serve as a wake-up call in a country that he said has ignored racial divides for far too long.\n\"This is the ugly truth of America. It was there like literally and figuratively in black and white. We saw it. We see it daily,\" Southall said. \"It shows what kind of America we live in now and what kind of America it will be with Trump at the helm.\""]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.98", "GPT Reasoning: The article is political news covering Donald Trump's comments about an incident at a campaign rally and a Black Lives Matter protester.

And of course, Ms. Huffington herself was at the center of the whole episode.\nWhen Ms. Huffington, the 57-year-old author and former conservative pundit, announced her plans for The Huffington Post three years ago, many critics dismissed the idea as a digital dinner party for her new liberal friends. But it has grown in ways that few, except perhaps Ms. Huffington herself, expected.\nIn February, The Huffington Post drew 3.7 million unique visitors, according to Nielsen Online, for the first time beating out The Drudge Report, the conservative tip sheet with which The Post is often compared. On Technorati, a blog search tool, The Huffington Post is the second-most-linked-to blog, behind only the technology site TechCrunch. As Roy Sekoff, the site\u2019s editor, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to be part of the national conversation.\u201d\nWhen Barack Obama made his first public remarks about his controversial pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., he did so in a post on the site. \u201cIt was immediately picked up everywhere,\u201d Ms. Huffington recalled. \u201cIt helps to be bookmarked by the mainstream media.\u201d\nAnd The Huff Post, as it\u2019s known, has come to symbolize a certain combination of entrepreneur and online commentator, creating a brand and a business around Ms. Huffington. But she and her co-founder, Kenneth Lerer, have broader aspirations. In the last 12 months, they have introduced new content areas devoted to subjects like entertainment and business, and they have three more \u2014 international news, sports and books \u2014 coming soon.\nMs. Huffington herself now spends less time on blog posts condemning the Bush administration (although there\u2019s still plenty of that) and more time reimagining The Huffington Post as what she calls an \u201cInternet newspaper.\u201d In October, the site hired a new chief executive, Betsy Morgan, from CBS Interactive, and this summer the site will take an ambitious step by introducing its version of a metropolitan section: local versions for major cities.\nWhether readers will follow the site into new areas, however, is an open \u2014 and expensive \u2014 question. The plan will put The Huffington Post into competition with existing newspapers and, arguably, with companies like Yahoo, AOL and CNN.com.\n\nArianna Huffington in her company\u2019s New York offices. Credit Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times\n\n\u201cSuccess on the Web is defined by spotting niches and serving them well,\u201d said Micah L. Sifry, the editor of the blog TechPresident.com. \u201cWill people go to The Huffington Post for great sports blogging? They\u2019re certainly not going to go see what Arianna says about opening day,\u201d he added.\nThe sheer audacity of the plan should not surprise anyone who has followed Ms. Huffington\u2019s career. A native of Greece, she has been the president of the Cambridge University debating society; an author of books about feminism, Picasso and government waste; a panelist on radio and television shows; and a candidate in the 2003 California gubernatorial election.\n\u201cShe\u2019s had at least nine lives,\u201d said Michael Kinsley, a co-founder of Slate and a columnist for The Washington Post. \u201cSomeone will turn it into an opera. Probably her.\u201d\nShe usually works in Los Angeles by the fireplace of her mansion in the affluent Brentwood neighborhood (the site\u2019s West Coast staff of six also works out of her home). Last week, she was in New York, meeting with staff members, sitting for an interview with the ABC newsmagazine \u201c20/20\u201d and speaking about online politics at New York University.\nWhen she introduced The Huffington Post in May 2005, she combined her posts with those of celebrities. Ms. Huffington prefers to say it has \u201cas many interesting voices as possible.\u201d\nBut blogs often fade away as their creators tire of them, and many of the boldface names Ms. Huffington signed up and publicized in 2005 did not follow through. The retired anchorman Walter Cronkite and the former Bush speechwriter David Frum have each written three posts since the site started. The actress Diane Keaton and the lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr. have each written only two. Others, like former Senator Gary Hart, the screenwriter and producer Nora Ephron and the television host Bill Maher, continue to contribute regularly.\nThose who do contribute are met with varying degrees of fame online; many of the posts receive less than 10,000 views. But, especially when the posts are linked on the front page, the site provides a megaphone and gives authors some prominence. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very successful in selling people\u2019s books,\u201d Ms. Huffington remarked.\nMs. Huffington, whose title is editor in chief, said she did not have a particular traffic goal in mind but sought to \u201cnot just speak to the choir\u201d of progressive political addicts.\nWhen Ms. Morgan, the site\u2019s chief executive, arrived last fall, she immediately drew attention to metrics by requesting daily traffic statistics, weekly revenue estimates and monthly goals for both figures.\n\nMatt Drudge, the man seen as her conservative counterpart. Credit Evan Agostini/Getty Images\n\nThe topical focuses seem to be helping. The site had 1.8 million unique visitors in December, 2.9 million in January and 3.7 million in February, according to Nielsen Online. (The Post\u2019s internal numbers are much larger; many online publishers contend the Nielsen figures are underestimates.)\nStaff members also credit much of the growth to moves that have made the site\u2019s commentary more prominent on search engines like Google and Yahoo. More than half of traffic now comes from nonpolitical pages.\n\u201cAt first, we were very narrow,\u201d said Mr. Lerer, the co-founder. Comparing the expansion to the widening of a highway, he said the political front page was first complemented by media coverage, then by sections for living and entertainment. Mr. Lerer said he looked at the sections of a printed newspaper as a model. This year the site quietly changed its slogan to \u201cthe Internet newspaper.\u201d\nThe venture was profitable in some of its early months, executives say, but most of the revenue has been reinvested to hire editors, reporters and advertising representatives. Mr. Lerer estimated that it would raise $6 million to $10 million this year, twice the amount of last year. Advertisers have included Starbucks, the Discovery Channel and Volkswagen, Mr. Lerer said.\nThe expansion of content areas and the hiring of a chief executive have prompted speculation that Ms. Huffington could sell the Web site after the election. In an interview, she shied away from the possibility, saying \u201cit\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve discussed.\u201d\nAccording to one person who was briefed on discussions but was not permitted to speak for attribution, the company has at least looked at the value of the site if it were put up for sale, and a figure around $200 million was used. That would put the price at more than $50 for each visitor, a high valuation. Using the site\u2019s internal figures, 14 million unique visitors for the most recent month, the price would be closer to $15 for each user.\nIn the meantime, The Post is suffering some growing pains. A number of people have ungracefully departed in the past year, a situation Mr. Lerer attributed to the difficulty in transforming \u201cold media\u201d employees.\nThe site has other challenges. Despite its number of visitors, it still has a high \u201cbounce rate,\u201d referring to users who visit one page and then leave the site. Drudge still records seven times the monthly page views of The Huffington Post, meaning that readers are frequently refreshing for the latest headlines.\nMs. Huffington and her colleagues reject the comparisons, saying The Post seeks to be a community, not merely a collection of links. As new topical subsites come online, especially the one for local news, the site will increasingly try to act as an Internet curator with a distinct attitude, mixing blog posts, original news and links to other sources.\n\u201cLook at Yahoo or Google or CNN. Take away the branding and just look at the headlines, and they\u2019re very similar,\u201d said Mr. Sekoff. \u201cBut if you take away the branding of The Huffington Post and the signage, you\u2019d probably still recognize us.\u201d\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Citizen Huff."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.98", "GPT Reasoning: The article profiles Arianna Huffington and The Huffington Post, focusing on media, publishing, and politics.

This week saw both trends in effect, with Trump very much driving the bus on the fate of former beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and broad conservative hostility to government social assistance programs driving the bus on the fate of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\nThe two narrative threads meet in Arizona, where both the Trumpier and establishmentier wings of the party are fielding very strong candidates in an upcoming Senate primary, with the winner set to face a strong Democratic challenger on whose shoulders the party\u2019s hopes for retaking the Senate largely rest.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know. \nTrump scuttled a DACA deal\nAfter a televised meeting with members of Congress in which the president seemed confused on policy specifics but ready to agree to anything Congress agreed to regarding the fate of the DREAMers, a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement on a proposal, only to have the White House scuttle it based on the objections of Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR).\n\nPresident Trump presides over a meeting about immigration with Republican and Democrat members of Congress in the Cabinet Room of the White House on January 9.\n\nWhy it matters: Without a deal, we may be looking at a government shutdown and are almost certainly looking at serious negative consequences for nearly 700,000 immigrants who\u2019ll lose their work permits and protection from deportation.\nWhat\u2019s going on? There\u2019s a strong contrast between what Trump keeps saying (that he sympathizes with the DREAMers\u2019 plight and wants to help them but also wants to do something on border security) and what he keeps doing (deferring to the most hardline anti-immigration members of his party, who insist on sweeping revisions to immigration policy). His stated position is very conducive to dealmaking, but his actions make a deal impossible.\nWhat\u2019s next? Nobody has officially broken off negotiations, so it\u2019s still possible in principle that a deal will be reached. Certainly it doesn\u2019t seem too hard to imagine a deal that could get 60 votes in the Senate. But if the White House doesn\u2019t want a deal \u2014 and it seems like that\u2019s the case \u2014 there won\u2019t be one.\nCHIP got cheaper but still didn\u2019t pass\nCongressional Republicans have been refusing to do a five-year extension of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program over demands that it, unlike the $1.5 trillion tax cut the GOP passed late last year, be paid for through offsetting spending cuts. But new analyses from the Congressional Budget Office have drastically reduced the price tag \u2014 to less than $0 over the long run.\n\nNancy Pelosi (D-CA) confers with an aide during a press conference on the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program on December 20, 2017. During the press conference, Democrats urged Republican members of Congress to \"drop their partisan CHIP reauthorization and adopt reasonable offsets to ensure 9 million children keep their health care.\"\n\nThe CBO\u2019s new math: New estimates from the CBO say that a five-year extension would cost $800 million, and a 10-year extension would save $6 billion.\nWhy it works: The core issue is that by repealing the individual mandate in last year\u2019s tax bill, Republicans pushed up premiums on Affordable Care Act marketplaces. But low-income families are still eligible for ACA subsidies \u2014 subsidies that rise in line with premiums \u2014 so under the new system, it will be cheaper to give kids CHIP insurance than to have them buy it on the marketplaces.\nThere\u2019s still no deal: Since the argument was originally about how to offset the cost of extending CHIP funding but there now is no cost of extending CHIP funding, you\u2019d think that would get Congress to an easy agreement, but Republican leadership still has no plans to bring a CHIP bill to the floor. The program\u2019s funding expired more than 100 days ago, and kids are losing insurance.\nTrump said some things\nThe Washington Post reported Thursday evening that during a meeting with lawmakers, President Trump questioned why people from \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa (plus Haiti) are allowed to come to the United States, while advocating that we find a way to bring in more immigrants from countries like Norway. \n\nHaiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse attends a ceremony in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on January 12. Moise's government issued a strongly worded statement denouncing what it called a racist view of Haitian immigrants and people from African countries.\n\nFacts on African immigration: According to the Migration Policy Institute, 39 percent of adult immigrants to the United States from sub-Saharan Africa have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, compared to 31 percent of the US-born population, so despite the White House\u2019s professed desire to make the immigration system more \u201cmerit-based,\u201d it\u2019s not clear what the problem specifically is with immigrants from Africa.\nTrump said some more stuff: Separately, the same evening, Trump did an interview with the Wall Street Journal that was full of bizarre remarks, ranging from, \u201cI know more about wedges than any human being that\u2019s ever lived,\u201d to, \u201cI probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.\u201d\nWhy it matters: This week was a reminder, if one was needed, that Trump has a few strongly held convictions about policy issues but detailed knowledge about none of them and little inclination to learn.\nArizona\u2019s Senate race heated up\nOutside of the Beltway \u2014 but very much with ramifications in the Capitol \u2014 the race to succeed Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in the United States Senate heated up, with two candidates officially announcing their intention to enter the race.\n\nUS Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ) speaks at a campaign rally on January 12.\n\nArpaio versus McSally: One is Martha McSally, a Republican House member from the southern portion of the state who also happens to be the first woman combat pilot in American history and a favorite of the GOP establishment. The other is Joe Arpaio, the Maricopa County sheriff turned felon turned pardon recipient who is a favorite of Donald Trump.\nAlso Ward and Sinema: Already in the race are Kelli Ward, a longtime local Tea Party favorite, former state legislator, and slightly kooky right-wing gadfly; and the Democrats\u2019 one candidate, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema of Phoenix, a well-regarded moderate.\nWhy it matters: All Senate seats matter. But Arizona is the centerpiece of Democrats\u2019 hopes of picking up the Senate in 2018. They need to pick up two seats; Nevada gives them their best shot, and Arizona is No. 2. They\u2019d also need all their incumbents to get reelected, a tall order on its own terms, but opposition party incumbents almost always win, so Arizona is at the center of the action.\nWas this article helpful?\n yes no \nAwesome, share it:"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article covers political news and policy developments (Trump, DACA, CHIP, Senate primary) and does not report on scientific studies, research findings, or academic work."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_48"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "2754.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Zsa Zsa Gabor, one of the first celebutantes, is dead at 99"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Corrections and clarifications:An earlier version of this story misidentified Ginger Rogers\u2019 co-star in the movie We\u2019re Not Married!\nZsa Zsa Gabor, the 99-year-old former beauty queen and actress, died Sunday in Los Angeles.\nHer friend and former publicist, Edward Lozzi, told USA TODAY that she died around 1 p.m. PT Sunday. The news was first reported by TMZ.\nShe was ahead of her time. In the Hollywood Golden Age, Gabor, or simply Zsa Zsa to most, was perhaps the first celebutante.\nIf there had been no Zsa Zsa, there probably would be no Kim Kardashian.\n\"She did not suffer fools well,\" said a statement from Lozzi, who had represented her \"on and off\" since 1989. \"Zsa Zsa Gabor was one tough cookie. Her beautiful lips and mouth would also be her worst enemy when and if she turned on the verbal machine gun. Most of her problems originated from that beautiful mouth.\n\"Zsa Zsa Gabor will always be an American icon and the klieg in the Gabor-Hilton dynasty.\"\n\nGabor had been in ill health since being hospitalized after a fall in July 2010. She had hip replacement surgery afterward but returned to the hospital several times for treatment of swelling and clots. Most of her right leg had been amputated because of gangrene.\nAlthough after her television career Gabor had become a punchline or a caricature, known for her run-in with a Beverly Hills cop or for her many marriages, it wasn\u2019t always that way. Gabor was of a time when \u201csocialite\u201d was not yet a term of derision.\nDespite a spotty film career, she became a staple on TV. She often appeared as herself and spoofed her active social life with a quip and a \u201cdahlink\u201d that became her signature term of endearment.\n\n Glamorous actress Zsa Zsa Gabor died Sunday at age 99. Here, she appears in director John Huston's 1952 production of 'Moulin Rouge.' AP\nLast SlideNext Slide\nShe was born Sari Gabor in Budapest, Hungary in 1917, the middle of three sisters. Magda and Eva also were actresses and socialites; Eva starred on TV\u2019s Green Acres. Eva Gabor died in 1995 and Magda in 1997.\nZsa Zsa competed in the 1936 Miss Hungary pageant but, her mother\u2019s biography she said, was disqualified for being underage.\nShe made her film debut in the musical Lovely to Look At (1952) opposite Red Skelton, Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel. Fittingly for someone who became famous just for being herself, Gabor\u2019s character\u2019s name was Zsa Zsa.\nThat same year, she also had a part in We\u2019re Not Married! with Ginger Rogers and Fred Allen and starred in Moulin Rouge with Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. Gabor later appeared opposite onetime husband George Sanders in Death of a Scoundrel (1956) and had a small role in Orson Welles\u2019 Touch of Evil (1958). Memorably, she played Talleah in the B-movie Queen of Outer Space (1958).\n\nBeginning in the 1950s through the 1980s, Gabor was a frequent guest on television, in series as diverse as Playhouse 90 and the Colgate Comedy Hour to F Troop and Batman, as well as countless appearances on variety and talk shows.\nShe was glamorous, quick-witted and not afraid to make fun of herself or her nine marriages (including to Conrad Hilton, Paris Hilton\u2019s great-grandfather), seven divorces and one annulment. Sample joke: \u201cA man in love is incomplete until he has married \u2014 then he\u2019s finished.\u201d Or, touting her housekeeping abilities, she noted that despite her divorces, she manages to keep the house.\nGabor made headlines and jump-started her career in 1989 after an altercation with a police officer. She slapped the officer after being stopped for a driving violation and was arrested on charges of assault.\n\nShe was fined and sentenced to three days in jail after failing to complete the terms of her probation. A civil suit was settled out of court in 1991. The incident resulted in an unauthorized documentary, The People Vs. Zsa Zsa Gabor (1991). That same year, she memorably spoofed the incident in The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear.\nIn later years, Gabor appeared as herself in such movies as The Beverly Hillbillies (1993) and A Very Brady Sequel (1996).\nBut legal troubles kept her name in the headlines. In June 2005, she and her husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, sued Gabor\u2019s only child, Francesca Hilton, accusing her of larceny and fraud.\nDespite a tepid movie career, a tumultuous personal life and sometimes public legal wrangling, Gabor remained a celebrity for decades, a singular personality known by one name.

The death sentence against Mr. Hussein is still under review by an appeals court, but hundreds of people have already started lobbying the prime minister\u2019s office for the position.\nThey have sent messages through cabinet officials and their assistants, and by way of government guards and clerical workers. One candidate, an Iraqi Shiite living in London whose brother was killed by Mr. Hussein, telephoned an aide to the prime minister to say he was prepared to drop everything and fly to Baghdad to execute the former ruler.\n\u201cOne of the hardest tasks will be to determine who gets to be the hangman because so many people want revenge for the loss of their loved ones,\u201d said Basam Ridha, an adviser to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.\nMr. Hussein and two of his top associates, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti and Awad al-Bandar, were sentenced to \u201cdeath by hanging\u201d on Nov. 5 for their involvement in the arrest and killings of 148 men and boys after an assassination attempt against him in the town of Dujail in 1982. The nine-judge appeals bench has no time limit to issue its ruling, but if it upholds the death sentence, Mr. Hussein\u2019s execution must be carried out within 30 days.\nIraqi judicial officials said they expected that the appeals process would be completed in a matter of weeks and, if the sentence is upheld, that Mr. Hussein\u2019s hanging would take place between mid-January and mid-March.\nThe Shiite-led government has argued for a swift execution, saying that as long as Mr. Hussein is alive, he remains a powerful source of motivation for elements of the Sunni Arab insurgency fighting to restore him to power.\nThere are other critical issues the government will need to decide should the appeals court uphold the death sentence against Mr. Hussein, including where he will be executed.\nOfficials have considered staging a public hanging in Baghdad\u2019s largest sports arena, Shaab Stadium, and filling the place with tens of thousands of spectators, according to a high-ranking government official involved in the executions process, who agreed to discuss the subject on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about it on the record.\nBut while such a spectacle might satisfy a communal need for closure, the authorities have rejected the idea for security reasons. A target that big, they say, would be highly vulnerable to attack by Sunni insurgents who might try to lob a few mortar shells into the crowd or ambush spectators on their way to and from the event.\nGovernment hangings are now conducted in a prison complex in eastern Baghdad. Mr. Hussein, who is being held at Camp Cropper, an American military prison near Baghdad International Airport, could be transported to those gallows by helicopter. But officials worry that the trip would present an unnecessary opportunity for a rescue attempt by his sympathizers.\nMost likely, officials say, Mr. Hussein will be hanged at gallows specially built for him at Camp Cropper.\nThe death penalty in Iraq, which applies to a range of crimes including terrorism and certain categories of murder, was suspended in 2003 by the American occupation authorities but reinstated in August 2004. Since then, 51 people \u2014 men and several women \u2014 have been hanged and about 170 are currently on death row awaiting execution or the outcome of their appeal, according to Hashim al-Shibli, Iraq\u2019s justice minister.\nThose are the official numbers. The high-ranking government official involved in the executions process said the actual number of hangings was far higher, though fewer than 100, because of three sets of hangings that took place between December 2005 and March 2006 and were never publicized.\nHuman rights groups have questioned the transparency of the criminal justice system in Iraq and the ability of defendants to get a fair trial. And the United Nations has requested that the Iraqi government commute the sentences of all the prisoners on Iraq\u2019s death row. But Iraqi leaders have rebuffed calls for the abolishment of the death penalty, arguing that it serves as a deterrent to crimes.\n\nSaddam Hussein yelled in court on Nov. 5 after he was found guilty in his first trial for war crimes. He was sentenced to death by hanging. Credit Pool photo by David Furst\n\n\u201cMaliki wants to show decisiveness that people should be punished,\u201d said Mr. Ridha, Mr. Maliki\u2019s adviser. \u201cHe is very anxious that these executions take place in a timely manner.\u201d He added, \u201cThe number of executions that have taken place is not a great number compared to the number of insurgents in the country.\u201d\nThe gallows are in a concrete building within a heavily guarded prison complex in eastern Baghdad, near the headquarters of the Interior Ministry. Two scaffolds made of steel sit side by side in an otherwise unadorned room, according to the high-ranking government official, who has attended hangings there. (The Justice Ministry and the Maliki administration denied requests to visit the prison and, citing security concerns, refused to give the precise location of the site.)\nThe government prefers to conduct several hangings in a day for the sake of efficiency. Men condemned to death are held on Iraq\u2019s death row \u2014 a wing of rudimentary cells, separated from other inmates in the prison compound. Condemned women are held at a women\u2019s prison in Khadamiya, a neighborhood in northern Baghdad.\nThe prisoners are told they will be hanged on the morning of their executions, officials said. They are led out of their cells in single file, dressed in orange jumpsuits, their ankles and wrists manacled, and taken to a room off the gallows chambers, where they are allowed to sit on floor cushions. There, they are permitted to pray. They can eat a last meal if they request it, or smoke a cigarette. They are given an opportunity to compose a last will and testament. Then, two by two and hooded, they are taken to the gallows.\nThe victims are led up a set of steel stairs to a platform, about 15 feet above the ground, and nooses fashioned from one-and-a-quarter-inch-thick hemp ropes are slipped over their necks. The executioners are different each time, drawn from among employees of the Justice Ministry who volunteer for the job. Many have lost relatives or friends in insurgent attacks, officials said.\nWith a tug of two large levers, the steel trapdoors drop open and the victims fall through. The doors make a loud clanging sound as they slam against the apparatus, according to people who have witnessed hangings. The jarring noise echoes off the cold, unadorned concrete walls.\nDeath is supposed to come instantly \u2014 a doctor is on hand to certify it \u2014 and the bodies are removed to a cooler where they are held before being handed over to the victims\u2019 families. The entire process is recorded by a photographer and a video cameraman and the images are stored in a government archive.\nBut the hangings have not always gone smoothly.\nUntil the new gallows were built, the Iraqi government used an apparatus and an old rope left over from Mr. Hussein\u2019s government, said the high-ranking government official. The rope had become so elastic that it would sometimes take as much as eight minutes to kill the convicted person.\nOn Sept. 6, the Iraqi authorities planned to hang 27 people. On the 13th hanging, according to an official who was there, the rope snapped and the convicted man plummeted 15 feet through the trap door onto the concrete floor. \u201cGod saved me!\u201d the man cried. \u201cGod is great! I did not deserve this!\u201d For an hour, he lay on the ground praying and shouting while prison guards and the executioner debated whether this constituted divine intervention and, if so, whether the man\u2019s life should be spared. Once a new rope was rigged, however, the man was forced up the stairs once again and successfully hanged. The incident was first reported in Time magazine of Nov. 20.\nThe executions are conducted in secrecy to avert insurgent attacks. On March 9, a government convoy carrying a representative from the administration of Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari was ambushed on its way to the gallows. It was an unsuccessful effort to stop the representative from observing the day\u2019s hangings, including the execution of Shukair Farid, a murderous former police officer whom the government had nicknamed \u201cthe butcher of Mosul.\u201d\nOn another execution day, word leaked out and insurgents pelted the prison facility with mortar shells. The Iraqi subcontractors who built the new gallows, under the auspices of an American contractor, were forced to interrupt work several times because of threats by insurgents, officials said.\nThe current hanging procedures are an improvement over the methods used by Mr. Hussein, who conducted mass executions in a hangarlike building at Abu Ghraib prison. According to human rights groups, hundreds of prisoners were executed in a span of a few weeks in the 1990s to address prison overcrowding.\nMr. Hussein himself asked the court to execute him by firing squad, the method used for soldiers sentenced to death. He said it was his right because he was commander in chief of Iraq\u2019s armed forces at the time of the events in Dujail. His request was denied.\nThe protocols for his hanging have not yet been determined, including who will get to attend, Maliki administration officials said. In a standard Iraqi hanging, the attendance is limited to representatives from the Justice Ministry, the Interior Ministry and the prime minister\u2019s office, and a doctor. Mr. Shibli, the justice minister, said the convict\u2019s lawyer was allowed to attend, as well as a member of the clergy of the victim\u2019s choice, though in practice they rarely do.\nThe usual videographer and photographer will probably be on hand, as well, to record the hanging, officials said, and excerpts of the event may be shown later on national television. Mr. Ridha says the Iraqi people will want to see it.\nAbdul Razzaq al-Saeidi contributed reporting.\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Iraqis Line Up To Put Hussein In the Noose."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.98", "GPT Reasoning: The article discusses the legal process, potential execution of Saddam Hussein, political and social reactions \u2014 it is news/political reporting, not about scientific research or studies."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_50"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "3434.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Making caviar in Ohio"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["None \n Renee Koerner casts a net as her husband Keith Koerner guides the boat at a lake in southeastern Hamilton County Tuesday February 21, 2017.

Regardless of your views on marijuana, deploying limited federal resources to prosecute pot cases amid a raging opioid epidemic is like telling firefighters to inspect smoke detector batteries in one home while the house next door is engulfed in flames.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Postal Service could be doing more to intercept packages of illicit fentanyl coming from abroad. The Postal Service has moved at a lethargic pace to get much needed advance data from foreign countries that could cut exports of fentanyl, which is often mixed with or sold in place of heroin, to lethal effect. \nFor reasons that are unclear, the State Department, Justice Department and the president have had only limited success in getting China, the main source for fentanyl entering the United States, to assist in choking off the supply. \nSessions applauded the Chinese last week for restricting two chemical ingredients for fentanyl, an important move. But the Chinese government has failed to arrest two Chinese nationals, indicted by the U.S. last October as large distributors of fentanyl to Americans. Indictments aren\u2019t worth much if the criminals remain at large.\nMuch of the fentanyl, which can be ordered on the Internet, comes into this country from China and Mexico often in small packages via private shippers and the U.S. mail. Customs and Border Protection officers, looking to intercept illegal shipments, now have to go through bags and bins of parcels manually, a daunting task. \nThe Postal Service could more easily spot fentanyl if it had some basic data \u2014 who and where the package is coming from and the recipient\u2019s name and address \u2014 in advance. That would \u201caid in targeting shipments,\u201d a top Customs official told a Senate hearing last May.\nAlthough a federal law has required private shippers to provide advance electronic data since 2002, the Postal Service\u2019s participation was left up to the postmaster general and leaders of another Cabinet department. More than 15 years later, the Postal Service still doesn\u2019t demand this advance data from all countries.\nSince 2016, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and a bipartisan coalition that has grown to 29 senators and 252 House members have pushed a commonsense measure to require that all countries provide this electronic data. \nThe president\u2019s commission on opioids supports it, too.\nThe Postal Service's response? In testimony prepared for the Senate hearing, a top official said that it \u201cagrees with the goal\u201d of the measure, but that requiring all nations to provide this data immediately is \u201cimpractical\u201d and could cost as much as $4.8 billion over 10 years.\nWhy not start with maximum tracking of mail from China and any other countries that appear to be significant sources of synthetic opioids?\nNor has the U.S. given foreign countries a hard deadline to provide this potentially life-saving information. The best the Postal Service could offer was that it's \"seeing substantial data\" from China. It would not answer our questions about what percentage of Chinese mail comes with advance data.\n\u201cHow many more Americans have to die before our government gets its act together \u2026 to keep this poison out of our communities?\" Portman asked officials at the hearing.\nGood question.\nDeaths from drug overdoses have now far outstripped the toll from car crashes or guns, once the leading causes of accidental deaths.\nIn fact, for two years in a row, skyrocketing deaths from drug overdoses have dragged down how long Americans are expected to live.\nAccording to several national polls over the past two years, 49% of Americans, an astounding number, said they know someone who has been addicted to prescription painkillers. Yet according to the same polls, more than half said it is a major problem but not an emergency.\nPerhaps that\u2019s because the deaths don\u2019t occur as mass tragedies but in an unending stream of individual casualties in cities, towns and rural communities across the country.\nGalvanizing the public would be helpful. More important is galvanizing the federal government into emergency mode to deal with an elusive mass killer, fentanyl, that is claiming the lives of more than two people every hour. \nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

The diagnosis did not come as a shock since doctors had determined her fianc\u00e9 was dying of AIDS several weeks earlier.\nIn the two decades since, Haught, 48, has turned to expensive prescription drugs to keep the deadly infection in check. In 2005, she began receiving help purchasing her medications through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), a federally funded network of programs in each state that assist low-income HIV and AIDS patients. Since the Affordable Care Act was implemented, ADAP instead has helped her buy an insurance policy to cover a wide assortment of her health care needs.\nNationally, more than 139,000 clients were served by ADAPs in June 2015, according to the latest report from the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD), a coalition of state officials responsible for administering HIV and hepatitis programs. About half of those clients were getting help purchasing insurance through the federal health law\u2019s marketplaces or elsewhere, a switch from the program\u2019s historical role of paying primarily for expensive prescriptions.\nAdvocates fear Republican plans to overhaul the health law could cause such upheaval in the individual insurance market that the program could not afford to continue the premium assistance and would be forced to turn primarily back to subsidizing medication.\n\u201cWe are at a pivotal point in HIV where people are talking about the end of the epidemic,\u201d said Ann Lefert, senior director of the prevention and care program and policy at NASTAD. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that if the health care coverage changes dramatically, it would be hard to get there in the same speed.\u201d\nAccording to the AIDS directors\u2019 report, in June 2015, about 72,000 got help paying for their insurance, including nearly 4,000 who also received assistance to purchase medication. That\u2019s more than twice as many as got insurance help in 2010, when the health law was passed.\nTo qualify for ADAP assistance, prospective clients must meet standards determined by the state. Individuals must prove their residency and recertify every six months. NASTAD reported more than 70 percent of clients served by ADAP in June 2015 reached viral load suppression, or undetectable levels of HIV in the blood. By comparison, only 3 out of 10 people living with HIV in the U.S. reached suppression in 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.\nADAP is required to choose the most cost-effective way to assist clients. Currently, that option often is financial assistance for purchasing an insurance plan that covers broad health expenses. But before the ACA, when insurance companies could legally exclude customers with preexisting conditions or charge them very high premiums, buying insurance was difficult for HIV patients.\nConsequently, the program focused primarily on helping patients buy the pricey drugs they needed. It struggled to meet that demand, however, often using waiting lists to determine which low-income clients could be helped. At its peak, 9,278 individuals waited to access ADAP services, according to NASTAD. The program eventually eliminated the waiting list in 2013.\nFor many of those low-income patients, it was the only help available, given they weren\u2019t eligible in many states for Medicaid, which generally limited eligibility to children, very-low income families and people with debilitating conditions.\n\u201cMost people had to be disabled in order to get access to Medicaid services, even though the treatments that became available in the 1990s prevented you from being disabled,\u201d said Jeffrey Levi, a health management and policy professor at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.\nBut the ACA\u2019s provisions \u2014 principally, the Medicaid expansion undertaken by 31 states and the District of Columbia; subsidies for low-income people buying plans on the insurance marketplace; and consumer insurance protections \u2014enabled ADAP to spend less on purchasing drugs and use its funds more efficiently to help clients buy coverage. They could use the assistance to pay the portion of premiums not covered by federal tax subsidies and expenses not picked up by their plans, such as deductibles and copayments.\nThe NASTAD report also found that ADAP paid an average of $1,678 per client for medications in June 2015. In contrast, the program contributed an average $444 to health plans for clients. Some insured clients, however, also received help paying for medication.\nWhile Lefert said she doesn\u2019t anticipate waiting lists returning to ADAP if the health law is partially repealed, other experts worry about how far existing funds can be stretched.\n\u201cNow you\u2019re going to have a bunch of people rushing back to the [ADAP] pool with not enough dollars to cover them all,\u201d said Matthew Rose, policy and advocacy manager for the National Minority AIDS Council.\nChanges to the health law could interrupt treatment and lead to gaps in care, said Erin Loubier, senior director for health and legal integration and payment innovation at the Whitman-Walker Health clinic in Washington, D.C. And without protections from discrimination based on preexisting conditions, she said, people could shirk screening for fear of losing their jobs or health insurance.\nHaught, of Nashua, Iowa, now works as a training coordinator for the SERO Project, an advocacy group fighting against HIV criminalization laws around the nation. Haught said she\u2019s surprised that she\u2019s lived 23 years past her diagnosis, which allowed her to see her son graduate and spend time with her grandson, Chase. Taking her medication is critical.\n\u201cI will die if I don\u2019t have access to my medication and treatment, and it\u2019s not pretty,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s not an easy death.\u201d\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nCONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINEMAILMORE\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2nwXh1V"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article focuses on health coverage, the ADAP program, patient experiences and policy implications of changes to the Affordable Care Act, not on scientific studies, research findings, or clinical trial results."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_53"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "2784.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["NFL Teams - NFL Football"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Already a print edition subscriber, but don't have a login?\nActivate your digital access."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The title and content relate to NFL/sports and a subscription/login notice, with no mention of studies, research, or scientific findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_54"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "91.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Fallece Emanuel, el menor cubano que ten\u00eda un enorme tumor en el rostro"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - El menor cubano Emanuel Zayas, quien fue operado de un tumor en su cara del tama\u00f1o de una pelota de baloncesto, falleci\u00f3, seg\u00fan confirm\u00f3 uno de los m\u00e9dicos que intervino en su operaci\u00f3n. \nRobert E.

Nu\u00f1o / Sep.01.2017 / 2:12 PM ET\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Chicago aerial view, Chicago, Illinois.University of Chicago\nAnother school year begins and Latinos across the country are entering college in record numbers. Your first days in college will certainly produce anxiety, excitement and lots of questions. Below are some thoughts and practical advice for college students from Latino professors who have \"been there, done that\" when it comes to education.\nStudy what you love\nCollege is a critical time for self-exploration and personal development. You may be looking at a long list of requirements and be asked early on to figure out what your major will be.\nAs you\u2019re dealing with this pressure, remember to also think about you. What do you love to do best? What are you most passionate about? What makes you want to get out of bed every morning (or most every morning!)? What makes you happy?\nBelieve it or not, your classes can help you figure that out; choose classes carefully so that you approach not only core requirements but classes that can help you choose a major with these questions in mind. Talk to your advisors. Do a little research; look at course syllabi and check out what students are reading. And talk to your peers about the kinds of courses and professors that had the biggest impact on them and why.\n\n\nAngelica Maria Bernal, University of Massachusetts\n\nThen, as you are more immersed in a major that is a good fit, think about how to take that major to the next level: what extra-curriculars, internships, community service and study abroad opportunities can help you to better develop your passions?\nThink beyond your classes: maybe you can approach a professor to help them with their research, attend a talk on campus (or other nearby campuses) that sounds interesting, or reach out to fellow students to organize something new.\nStudents of color face a great deal of pressure, including financial pressure. Advice like this might seem like a luxury, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Oftentimes, the most successful individuals are the ones who turned their passions into careers. It takes a lot of work and personal initiative, but it\u2019s not out of reach. Use your academic experience to the fullest to help you better develop yourself!\nAng\u00e9lica Maria Bernal is an Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the Department of Political Science, and Director of the Academic Fellows Program.\nMaintain home, cultural connections\nCulture shock is what many first-generation students experience as they acclimate to a university system that is set up for white and affluent students to succeed. You can overcome this by maintaining connections to home and community. The greatest asset you possess is your own cultural knowledge and finding a tribe on campus that values its imperative.\nMany first-generation students often find themselves feeling guilt over the financial and social obligations to the family versus their individual schooling. Women have the added pressure of confronting gendered expectations with parents, such as when making decisions about moving away from home.\n\n\n\nGlenda Flores, Steve Zylius / UCI Steve Zylius / UCI\n\nRemember, you are a student first and the best way to give back to your family for their sacrifices in the long run is by obtaining your degree and career.\nOn the classroom front, here's a good tip. While taking pictures of the lecture slides may seem like a time-saving strategy, nothing helps you retain information more and perform better academically than putting pen to paper. Take notes. Studies confirm this!\nThen, rewrite or read your notes right after class. A general rule of thumb is twelve hours of work for every four-unit course per week. This includes reading the material, making outlines of the readings, study groups, and writing out your lecture notes, to name a few.\nGlenda M. Flores is Associate Professor of Chicano/Latino Studies & Director of Undergraduate Studies at UC Irvine.\n\nTake care of your body and your mind \nTo grab your dreams you have to dig deep and be honest with yourself. Know your strengths and more importantly, understand your weaknesses. To be successful, you have to face these fears and weaknesses head on.\nPlan ahead, organize yourself, and establish short and long-term goals using a career development plan.\n\n\n\nEdward D. Vargas, Arizona State University\n\nCollege won\u2019t be easy, but we are here to help along the way. So reach out and make sure you develop relationships with mentors and folks who truly care about your well being.\nYou must also invest in yourself. So, keep yourself healthy by taking care of your body and your mental health.\nRemember, this is your life. So don\u2019t only reach for your dreams, grab them!\nEdward D. Vargas is an Assistant Professor in the School of Transborder Studies at Arizona State University.\nYou're special, but not that special\nIf you are among the first in your family to attend a college or university, one of the few people from your high school to pursue higher education, or on a campus that\u2019s not particularly diverse, you may feel like you\u2019ve been admitted to college against the odds.\nFor some, this is accompanied by a feeling that you don\u2019t belong at your institution and a crushing pressure to succeed for your family, friends, and comunidad.\n\n\n\nAmada Armenta, University of Pennsylvania\n\nSince Latinos are generally underrepresented in American colleges and universities, your achievements are remarkable and noteworthy. On the other hand, Latinos and other minority students have been going to college and succeeding for generations.\nWhile you may be blazing a trail for your family, you are absolutely not alone. Being the exceptional \u201cchosen one\u201d is really stressful!\nSo here's some good advice. Give yourself permission to be yourself.\nAmada Armenta is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article is an advice/opinion piece for incoming college students from Latino professors about choosing majors and campus life.

I think by the way he's doing great.\"\nRead More\nTrump wanders into a meeting between his chief of staff and a bunch of reporters. First question: You guys like this guy? So, so Trump-y.\n2. \"Fake news yesterday, or two days ago. I rarely put out a tweet, praising somebody, but only when they get a false story.\"\nTrump is referring to a Vanity Fair piece published Monday that alleged Kelly and the President were on the outs. Also, Trump \"rarely\" puts out a tweet \"praising somebody.\" Same, honestly.\n3. \"I don't even know if he saw that stuff, but I put it out.\"\nIf a tweet falls in the forest...\n4. \"Nice to see you all. The economy is doing very well.\"\nNon sequitur, Donald Trump. President Trump, non sequitur.\n5. \"I'm going to Davos to get them to bring back a lot of money.\"\nWait. They give away money at Davos? So that's why people love it so much!\n6. \"Thank you for some of the nice things you've said over the recent past.\"\nI'm not sure which reporter Trump is referring to but it doesn't matter. The point here is a) he is hyper-aware of media coverage of him and b) his feelings about reporters are entirely tied to whether or not they have written nice things about him of late.\n7. \"We're going to get the wall, we're going to get great border security.\"\nWell, I'm convinced!\n8. \"Over a period of 10-12 years, somebody does a great job, they've worked hard, it gives incentive to do a great job.\"\nBIG news here. Trump is saying that Dreamers will have a path to citizenship after \"10-12 years.\" People like Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, seized on this comment as a sign Trump is committed to finding a workable solution on the immigration issue. But, if past is prologue, Trump could well say something totally different within a day or two.\n9. \"If they do a great job, I think it's a nice thing to have the incentive of, after a period of years, being able to become a citizen.\"\nWhile floating a path to citizenship is obviously a big deal, notice the fuzziness built into Trump's answer. How is the judgment of \"do a great job\" made? And by whom?\n10. \"Yeah, I might do that. I might do that.\"\nThis is Trump responding to a question on whether he might extend the DACA deadline if Congress can't reach a deal on the program by March. Classic cliffhanger for the reality TV star. Stay tuned for next week's episode!\n11. \"But chain, where we get the lottery system is a broken system, they put people in a lottery.\"\nI mean, your guess is as good as mine.\n12. \"They're not putting their finest in that system, you would not be in that system.\"\n\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you.\" -- Donald Trump, June 16, 2015.\n13. \"Well it has to go in a very strong form, absolutely, and I think even the Democrats know that the lottery system is not good, it's a bad, it's a bad system.\"\nLottery system: Not good. Bad. Got it?\n14. \"We want to have a good strong family and we're going to treat people very well.\"\nThis seems sensible.\n15. \"When you have a mountain, you don't build a wall, OK?\"\nI think Socrates first said that.\n16. \"When you have a river that is un-crossable, that you cannot cross, you don't build a wall, OK?\"\n\"We'd go down to the river/And into the river we'd dive/Oh down to the river we'd ride\" -- The Boss\n17. \"So I think we're gonna be very successful, but no, Schumer -- well, I can tell you this: if you don't have a wall, you don't have DACA.\"\nSo, here we are. Earlier this week Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, took wall funding off the table as part of a DACA deal. And now Trump says that without wall funding, there is no DACA. This is fine.\n18. \"I like him! I like him! I grew up with Schumer.\"\n\"Cryin' Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA. We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!\" -- Donald Trump, Tuesday night\n19. \"Tell them not to be concerned, OK? Tell them not to worry about it, we're gonna solve the problem.\"\nRelax, Dreamers. Just chill. The Donald's got this.\n20. \"But we're saving hundreds of millions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, by building that wall.\"\nUm, is it millions or billions? Because, well, there's a big difference.\n21. \"In the initial, we're putting chain, a negotiated chain, we're putting a replacement for lottery or an end to lottery, and it could be a replacement, we bring people in from various countries, that come in based on merit and various other reasons, and we are going to build a wall.\"\nThis is one sentence. It is 51 words long.\n22. \"There has been no collusion whatsoever. There's no obstruction whatsoever.\"\nNo collusion! No obstruction! No surrender!\n23. \"I would love to do it. You know, again, I have to say, subject to my lawyers and all of that, but I would love to do it.\"\nThis is Trump on talking to special counsel Robert Mueller. My guess is his lawyers were, um, not happy that Trump said this without checking with them.\n24. \"I think you have an idea. Do you not have an idea? Do you REALLY not have an idea? I'll give you an idea: she didn't do it under oath. But I would do it under oath.\"\nTrump is referring here to Hillary Clinton's 2016 interview with the FBI during the organization's investigation into her use of a private email server. Clinton was not put under oath and there was no transcript of her interview created, according to then-FBI Director James Comey.\n25. \"If you didn't know about Hillary, then you're not much of a reporter.\"\nBoom. Roasted.\n26. \"I mean, I am very disturbed, as is the general, as is everybody else that is intelligent.\"\nTrump's response to whether or not he trusts the FBI is stunning. He is the President! This is the FBI!\n27. \"When you look at five months, this is the late great Rose Mary Woods, right? A step. This is a large scale version.\"\nTo be clear what Trump is doing here: He is equating the fact that the FBI is missing texts for a 5-month period from December 2016 to May 2017 with the allegedly accidental erasing of more than 18 minutes of White House recordings -- just days after the Watergate break-in -- by Nixon secretary Rose Mary Woods. Also, we learned Wednesday that it's not just texts from two FBI officials who expressed anti-Trump sentiments that were lost. It was the text messages from one in every 10 FBI phones. So...\n28. \"Well McCabe got more than $500,000 from essentially Hillary Clinton, and is he investigating Hillary Clinton?\"\nNope! McCabe's wife, when she was a candidate for state Senate in 2015, got a $467,000 contribution from a super PAC associated with then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Yes, McAuliffe is a longtime friend of the Clintons. But he is not, in fact, Hillary Clinton.\n29. \"Now Terry is Hillary.\"\nWho wants to tell him?\n30. \"I don't think so. No. I don't think so.\"\nTrump is responding here to a report in The Washington Post that he asked then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe who he voted for during a meeting shortly after Trump fired Comey. You don't have to be a word sleuth to realize that Trump isn't exactly denying it.\n31. \"I don't know what's the big deal with that, because I would ask you who you voted for, who did you vote for?\"\n\"How about this weather, huh?\"\n\"Yes, it's beautiful.\"\n\"How are the kids?\"\n\"Crazy, like always.\"\n\"So, did you vote for me in the election, or no?\"\n32. \"I only repeat, I only repeat for the purposes of making sure you understand.\"\nSame.\n33. \"No collusion. There's no collusion.\"\nNone. Zero. Zippy. Nada. Zilch.\n34. \"There's no collusion.\"\nThis is not the same quote. He just said it again. Like 10 words after he said it the last time.\n35. \"I was one of the greatest candidates.\"\nThis feels like a good place to end."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article is a political/news/opinion piece listing notable lines from a Trump presser; it does not report on studies, research findings, or scientific analysis."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_57"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "40.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Business - BBC News"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Does the world economy look too good?\nThere are two types of people at this year's Davos.

But viewers still face tough moral and aesthetic decisions.\n By \n \n \n \nNot only was Kevin Spacey fired from House of Cards; he also was snipped from the new film All the Money in the World.\n\nThe men of film, television, and radio who have been charged with sexual harassment and abuse are rapidly disappearing from the entertainment landscape.\nMinnesota Public Radio has decided to stick reruns of A Prairie Home Companion in the vault following allegations against Garrison Keillor. You will never again hear those meandering tales about Lake Wobegon that either captivated or irritated you \u2014 at least not on the public airwaves (and his musical guests are collateral damage). Louis C.K.\u2019s shows for HBO have vanished, and his movie I Love You, Daddy was shelved before it opened. \nKevin Spacey, already fired from House of Cards, was literally snipped out of the new film about the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty\u2019s grandson in 1973, All the Money in the World, and replaced by Christopher Plummer in hastily reshot scenes. \nAnd fans of the animated series Gravity Falls might notice that one character sounds a little different: Louis C.K.\u2019s voice was removed and redubbed with that of series creator Alex Hirsch \u2014 a powerfully metaphorical act at a time when there\u2019s so much talk of the relative weight of harassers\u2019 and victims\u2019 voices. \nFor those who want to go further and take it on themselves to avoid the art of alleged harassers, there\u2019s Rotten Apples, a site that flags films tied to people facing allegations of sexual harassment. Type Good Will Hunting into the site\u2019s search engine and up pops a list including Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, and Harvey Weinstein \u2014 with hyperlinks to stories about the allegations against them. Type in any Woody Allen movie and \u2014 well, you get the point. (All of Alfred Hitchcock now comes with an asterisk, because he was allegedly abusive toward Tippi Hedren.) \nThe drive to erase alleged sex predators from the entertainment landscape is understandable. These men built careers exploiting the women and men over whom they had power, but they also involved the rest of us in their predation, turning us into unwitting accomplices who consumed their art and lined their pockets. Part of removing them from streaming services or public radio networks is about ending that complicity; it\u2019s the industry\u2019s response to the audience\u2019s revulsion.\nBut the decisions by the entertainment industry to pull shows represent a flattened version of an important debate. The industry clearly bears responsibility for making sure the perpetrators are removed from positions of power. But distributors of preexisting works are surely mainly driven by the profit motive: They\u2019re worried that audiences will be offended by any company associated with sex predators and walk away.\nDespite the erasures, audiences still have to navigate their relationship to the art that remains available. We all have to evaluate how we relate to it both externally and internally (as I\u2019ve come to think of it). By \u201cexternally,\u201d I mean: What is the significance of consuming \u2014 and therefore supporting, financially or in terms of prestige \u2014 the art of a sexual predator? By \u201cinternally,\u201d I mean: How does it change the experiences of consuming that art? \nThese questions aren\u2019t new. Nor have they gotten any easier.\nThese aesthetic questions did not emerge for the first time with the Weinstein revelations. Indeed, the question of whether to boycott Allen\u2019s films has generated so much controversy over the years that the New York Times handed it over in 2014 to their ethicist columnist, in this case Chuck Klosterman.\nHis equivocal answer reveals how difficult of a question it is to untangle. On the one hand, Klosterman argued, you don\u2019t need a logical reason to avoid watching any film; it\u2019s not like jury duty. But if you do revisit Annie Hall or Manhattan, he said, \u201cThe obligation of the audience is to watch with a fair mind: to neither deny what you know about its real-world creation nor fabricate a fictional subtext that suits what you want to believe.\u201d\nWhich is murky advice for a murky quandary: What defines fair-mindedness in parsing subtext of a Woody Allen film, given the obsessive attention given to young women in his work (a theme, moreover, far more evident in Manhattan than Annie Hall)? \nIt\u2019s one thing to say you don\u2019t want to rent a Woody Allen movie because he\u2019ll profit. But how does it affect us internally to watch a film knowing the (alleged) bad acts of the auteur who created it? Or take the similar case of watching The Cosby Show, long beloved for its depiction of a middle-class black family at a time when such depictions were almost entirely absent from the cultural landscape. When scores of women came forward to detail their experiences of sexual harassment and assault by its star, TV Land pulled reruns of the show (though it\u2019s still watchable on Amazon).\n\u201cI think an argument can be made, in some cases, for separating an entertainer\u2019s personal life, however messy it is, from how one feels about their art,\u201d wrote Zeba Blay, culture writer for the Huffington Post. \u201cBut the fact that Cosby used his Cliff Huxtable persona as leverage for allegedly perpetrating and hiding his assaults makes that impossible for me to do.\u201d\nHow does an audience member not view a Louis C.K. set differently when he jokes about the danger men represent to women? Having now admitted to being one of those dangerous men, his comedy takes on a darker, predatory tone, as a cover for bad acts rather than a genuine attempt at observational jokes. Humor that was once cringe-inducing becomes stomach-churning. \nMake the works available, so viewers can decide\nAs a historian, I strongly believe that it\u2019s important that we keep these men\u2019s work accessible. Woody Allen films are a genuinely important part of American film history. The Cosby Show is key to understanding representation in media and tangled issues of race, class, and acceptance. But I also can\u2019t imagine watching old episodes simply for entertainment.\nAllen\u2019s and Cosby\u2019s work holds little personal weight for me. But I do continue to watch one of my most beloved shows, Parks and Recreation, even though Louis C.K. plays a recurring role in the second season. But now when he appears on-screen, the warmth of watching a beloved character is gone, and instead I find myself thinking not of the character Dave Sanderson but of the abuser Louis C.K., and my sense of escapism is shattered. Now I skip those episodes. \nThis isn\u2019t simply a matter of personal revulsion. There is a genuine moral problem at the heart of continuing to consume shows starring these men for pure entertainment purposes. Consuming fiction requires people to wall off certain information they have: that these are actors, that there\u2019s a script, that there is no fourth wall on that familiar living room set. That\u2019s not information I can set aside any more, not only because I simply can\u2019t forget, but also because to set it aside is to conclude that my need to be entertained by a particular work is more important than my need to remain aware of, and appalled by, the abuses these men have committed. \nSuch a calculation necessarily requires diminishing the importance of the abuse to something less than, at most, a few hours of entertainment. That\u2019s a gross devaluation of the victims and their experiences. \nBut many cases remain complicated, including the movie Frida. The film was distributed by Harvey Weinstein at Miramax. And thanks to a recent essay by the film\u2019s star and producer, Salma Hayek, we know that Weinstein used the film to sexually harass and exploit her. (Among other things, he forced her to do a gratuitous nude love scene, Hayek says.) So pull it, right? Scrub it from the universe. At the least, don\u2019t watch it. \nExcept we also know that the film was intensely personal to Hayek, the result of tireless effort to bring the story of Frida Kahlo to the big screen. Avoiding the film because it is a Weinstein production punishes the woman who endured his harassment in order to bring her vision to life. No artistic product belongs entirely to one person, especially in the world of film and broadcasting \u2014 auteur theory aside. \nTo take the discussion out of the realm of modern cinema for a moment, consider the case of Paul Gauguin. The pathbreaking French artist not only abused his wife but regularly had sex with \u2014 abused \u2014 the Tahitian girls he painted, some as young as 13. Many of the girls and women in his famed portraits are not just his subjects \u2014 they are his victims. Sexual violence abounds in his work. So what do we do with this information? Gaugin remains a crowd favorite. Should institutions cease exhibiting his paintings? Should they warn visitors? \nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer, though we can probably build consensus on a few absolutes: Banishing a person\u2019s work from exhibitions goes too far; letting living abusers go unpunished doesn\u2019t go far enough. \nBeyond that, each case demands nuanced judgment that somehow avoids excuse-making, something our culture is particularly ill-suited for at this moment. And, yes, it does seem unfair to give such patient, careful regard to men who had no such care for the women and men they abused. \nBut as with most contentious questions, the answer seems to boil down to \u201cmore, not less\u201d: more awareness of what these men have done and how it has affected their art and their colleagues, more debate over the best place for their art in our society, more opportunities for their victims and their art. In that light, we might view the Rotten Apples site not as an invitation to never watch a Hitchcock film again, but rather to think harder when we do.\nWe don\u2019t need to erase these men and their art, but we can no longer see it as unalloyed entertainment or drama, hermetically sealed off from the \u201creal world.\u201d The moral compromise required to view it in that way is too great. And as the last few months have constantly reminded us, we\u2019ve already made enough moral compromises.\nNicole Hemmer, a Vox columnist, is the author of Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics.

Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThough none of the North Korean athletes competing at next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea are expected to win a medal, they will at least be assured of a thunderous reception.\nWhen North Korea recently agreed to send a large delegation to the Games, which open in Pyeongchang on 9 February, there was speculation over which athletes might take advantage of the 11th-hour wildcard entries offered by the International Olympic Committee.\nBut far more excitement greeted Wednesday\u2019s news that the athletes will be accompanied by 230 members of the \u201carmy of beauties\u201d, North Korea\u2019s all-female cheerleading troupe who \u2013 international politics permitting \u2013 will be dispatched to portray a gentler image of one of the world\u2019s most brutal dictatorships.\nThe women, all in their late teens or early 20s, are handpicked from elite universities and undergo strict background checks to ensure they are not related to defectors or Japanese sympathisers, according to Chinese media.\n\u201cThey must be over 163cm (5ft 4ins) tall and come from good families,\u201d said An Chan-il, a defector who runs the World Institute for North Korea Studies. \u201cThose who play an instrument are from a band and others are mostly students at the prestigious Kim Il-sung University,\u201d he told AFP.\nAs the daughters of well-connected families in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, they are highly unlikely to defect, according to Jiro Ishimaru, a Japanese documentary-maker who runs a network of secret citizen journalists in the North.\nCheerleading aside, their role is to challenge the common perception of North Korea as an economically backward state whose people are malnourished. \u201cAs well as being young, tall and beautiful, they train extremely hard so that they don\u2019t put a foot wrong,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThey\u2019re out to impress people, particularly South Koreans.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRi-Sol-ju, a former cheerleader, with her husband, the North Korean dictator Kim-Jong-un.

Some reports said they would be accommodated on a cruise ship moored in Sokcho, about an hour\u2019s drive from Pyeongchang.\nWhile the Games\u2019 organisers anticipate a late surge in ticket sales, sports fans from other countries expecting to swap stories and mementoes with the North Korean cheerleaders will be disappointed.\nNone of the women will want to risk the fate that awaited 21 of their predecessors who were reportedly sent to a labour camp for talking about what they had seen during their 2005 visit to South Korea.\nIshimaru said the group would be practically impregnable for as long as they were in \u201cenemy territory\u201d. \n\u201cThey won\u2019t be given the freedom to do things we take for granted, like go out for a stroll,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will leave their accommodation together and return together at the end of each day.

Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay\n\n\u2018Something from the cupboard\u201d was a regular meal when I was growing up. Our family home was in the countryside and a good distance from the shops, so going out in January to buy something fresh meant de-icing our old Nissan Bluebird that was so full of holes, eye-stinging wind would whip around our necks and freeze our fingers blue. The thought of something from the cupboard, then, was a source of great comfort, and a foil to our laziness, because it meant we didn\u2019t need to leave the house.\nNaturally, we spent a lot of time with our noses in the kitchen drawers, wondering how best to use tins of this and pots of spices, alongside stalwarts of the vegetable basket, and turn them into meals. Most of the time, this resulted in the same old things: spinach and sweetcorn saag (makai palak), plum tomato and chickpea noodle curry (sev tamatar) and dal dhokli (chickpea pasta poached in dal).\nBut now that there is easy access to a more varied and global pantry, I tend to push the boat out and cook my way around south-east Asia on a regular basis: pad thai, laksa, penang curry and massaman curry share many ingredients in common \u2013 coconut milk, nuts, tamarind and galangal paste \u2013 as well as spices that keep for months, if not years. All are also forgiving enough to absorb most of our seasonal produce, while many of the base pastes can be made in a blender without a significant dent to flavour.\nToday\u2019s recipe is just such a dish. According to Thai food guru David Thompson, massaman curry has \u201call the hallmarks of southern Muslim food \u2013 rich with coconut cream and redolent of spices\u201d. There are many variations, but it\u2019s usually sweet, sour with tamarind and made using spices, peanuts and coconut; it also often features a starchy vegetable such as potato or sweet potato. Ordinarily complex to make, I\u2019ve taken liberties by using as many store-cupboard ingredients as possible.\nSweet potato and aubergine massaman curry\nFeel free to play around with the vegetable element: potatoes, broccoli, carrots and radishes would all be at home here. Serves four.\nFor the paste\n5 red bird\u2019s-eye chillies\n4 shallots, peeled and roughly chopped\n2 lemongrass stalks, tough outer leaves removed, then roughly chopped\n50g bunch coriander, leaves picked and set aside, stalks roughly chopped\n100g (4\u00bd tbsp) smooth peanut butter \n1\u00bd tsp ground cumin\n\u00be tsp ground cinnamon\n\u00bd tsp ground cloves\n1\u00bd tbsp galangal paste\n1\u00bd tbsp tamarind paste\n2\u00bd tsp sugar \n1\u00bd tsp salt\nFor the curry \n2 x 400ml tins coconut milk\n400g aubergine, cut into 2cm x 2cm chunks\n800g sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 3cm x 3cm chunks\n1 handful dried coconut slices, to garnish \nPut all the ingredients for the paste in a blender, add 100ml water and blitz to a paste.\nPut a large pan for which you have a lid on a medium heat and, once hot, fry the paste, stirring constantly, for five minutes, until dark and glossy; take care it doesn\u2019t catch and burn. Add the coconut milk little by little, stirring it into the paste as you go, then throw in the aubergine and bring the lot up to a bubble. Add the sweet potato, cover the pot, turn down the heat to a whisper and leave to cook for 20 minutes, until the aubergine has collapsed and the sweet potato is very tender.\nWhile the curry is cooking, toast the coconut slices. Put a small frying pan on a medium flame and, once hot, toast the coconut for a couple of minutes, until golden brown on both sides, then tip out on to a plate.\nTo serve, transfer the curry to a serving bowl, scatter the coriander leaves and coconut slices on top, and serve with plain rice.\n Topics"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.99", "GPT Reasoning: The article is a culinary piece featuring a vegan recipe and personal cooking narrative, with no discussion of scientific studies, research methods, or findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_64"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "434.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["F\u00fatbol | CNN"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["\u00bfSe le debe prohibir a los jugadores de f\u00fatbol el uso del celular? \nAlgunos directores t\u00e9cnicos de f\u00fatbol han optado por prohibir el uso de celulares a sus jugadores mientras se encuentran en una concentraci\u00f3n pues creen que los aparatos impiden la convivencia de equipo.

I worked for seven years on The X-Files, and loved that job immensely and learned pretty much everything that I needed to know when it came to running my own show. We did 202 episodes total in nine years of that show. I\u2019m not a great mathematician by nature, but I\u2019m guessing we did what? Like 170, 180 episodes just in the time I was there?\nI guess I\u2019m just plain amazed that in only 62 episodes of Breaking Bad, and now I think we\u2019ve aired 30 episodes of \u201dBetter Call Saul,\u201d for a total of 92, that the number is that few for something that has caught people\u2019s attention like it has. Coming from network TV, I\u2019m used to a much bigger number of episodes, much more bulk involved in the storytelling, so to speak. As a show creator, I love this new era of television that we\u2019re in, where these companies that we work for have figured out a way to monetize fewer episodes and make that work for their business models. Because in terms of being a writer, fewer is better. You have a chance to have a higher level of quality than when you\u2019re slinging 24, 26 episodes a year.\u201d\nGilligan dreamed up the idea for a dying chemistry teacher\u2019s meth-cooking venture while discussing the woes of being an unemployed writer with his best friend and eventual \u201dBreaking Bad\u201d writer and co-executive producer, Thomas Schnauz. Then he wrote and directed the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d pilot. In honor of the 10th anniversary of its Jan. 20, 2008 premiere, Gilligan took a trip down memory lane to share his favorite memories of Bad\u2019s beginnings, along with stars Bryan Cranston (Walter White), Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman), Betsy Brandt (Marie Schrader), RJ Mitte (Walter White, Jr.), Max Arciniega (Krazy-8), and costume designer Kathleen Detoro.\n\nGuests at Walt\u2019s 50th birthday party watch his brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) discuss a meth lab bust on TV.\n\nIN THE BEGINNING\u2026\nGilligan and Schnauz, friends since they met at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, joked that one way they could deal with the uncertainty of employment as writers would be to drive around the country in an RV that was also a mobile meth lab. Did that inspire the character of DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), whose drug bust in the pilot sparks the interest of his brother-in-law, Walter White, in making meth?\nVince Gilligan: You know, I remember when I was writing the pilot, I worried that it was a little too pat that Walt\u2019s brother-in-law happened to be a DEA agent. I thought to myself, \u201cThere\u2019s a way to go here [with] the story I\u2019ve got going: There\u2019s Skyler [Walter\u2019s wife, played by Anna Gunn], and there\u2019s Walt Jr., and there\u2019s a baby on the way, but there doesn\u2019t have to be a brother-in-law who\u2019s a DEA agent. It could just be that Walt happens to be watching TV one day, and he sees a bust on the news.\u201d You could do it all without that character of Hank Schrader.\nI remember going back and forth on that when I was plotting out that first episode. I guess I thought to myself, \u201cIf there\u2019s this extra element, if there was a real man\u2019s man in this story, a character right from the first act who is everything that Walt appears not to be, then that might make for some interesting storytelling.\u201d I think that\u2019s really where the idea for Hank came from, that Walt is cerebral and a bit soft, or at least that\u2019s what we think of him. We find out over the course of [the series] that he\u2019s never a physically imposing guy, but his will is downright scary. He, in fact, becomes the scariest guy in that universe by the end of it all. I liked the idea from the beginning to array him against someone who was comfortable in his own skin, a \u201cHail, fellow, well met,\u201d and boisterous, and gun-toting \u2014 just a real badass. It certainly helped, too, that it would help Walt realize just how much money could be made in this criminal enterprise of his.\nOne other thing I realized from the earliest days: I thought to myself, \u201cYou know, Walt\u2019s gotta be doing this, even if it\u2019s on an unconscious level, to stick it to his brother-in law. There\u2019s gotta be some antipathy there somewhere.\u201d He loves the guy, but on the other hand, as we see in that first episode at the birthday party, Hank essentially does the verbal equivalent of wrapping his arm around Walt\u2019s head and giving him a noogie. \nBryan Cranston (Walter White): When we first started this, it was very risky, because what Vince Gilligan was attempting to do had never been done on television: actually change a character over the course of the series. To this point, it had always been about things that could be depended on, whether that\u2019s Thomas Magnum or Archie Bunker, or Ross and Rachel. We would watch because we liked those characters. \u201cOh, here\u2019s a new situation, but we know how Ross and Rachel are going to feel about this.\u201d\nAnd it was all them navigating their way through their lives, but they never really changed. Even Tony Soprano was who he was from beginning to end. Vic Mackie from The Shield \u2014 all these characters that came before Walter White were tried and true, and greatly drawn characters.And then this came, and I read it, and when Vince told me what he wanted to do, I thought, \u201cThis has never been done.\u201d He goes, \u201cI know, I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re going to let us do it, but I\u2019d like to try.\u201d \u201cWell, OK.\u201d And so, when we started 11 years ago shooting the show, we didn\u2019t know anything was going to work. We knew we had a good script. All the actors, the whole crew, knew that this story was really, really special. But that doesn\u2019t always equate to success. In fact, many times it does not.\nSo we just had to have faith, keep our heads down, do the work, and hope that it could find some kind of audience. But no one could ever have guessed the avalanche of attention that \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d eventually received, and then became this incredible story and revered television show. I\u2019m very proud of that, obviously, but it just makes us dink our heads when we think about where we started. We had no idea that it could ever become what it became.\nCREATING WALTER WHITE AND COMPANY\nBoth Matthew Broderick and John Cusack, AMC network executives\u2019 first choices to play Walter White, passed on the part, which suited Gilligan just fine. He had Bryan Cranston in mind all along, having worked with the actor best known for comedies like Malcolm in the Middle and Seinfeld at that point, in a 1998 episode of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d called \u201cDrive.\u201d Cranston played a dying racist, but managed to make the character sympathetic, something Gilligan never forgot. Cranston was equally impressed with the ambitious story Gilligan planned to unfold with Walter White.\nCranston: Everything became more clear to me about the subtext after I had my first meeting with Vince, and he told me what he wanted to do. In the pilot, we see the setup of what happened to Walter: He finds out about his cancer, he\u2019s desperate to do something bold for his family before he dies. And so he makes that bold decision, and that creates the slippery slope. But beyond that, I didn\u2019t know where he had intended on going until the meeting, and he told me he wanted to change a good person into a bad person and have him become this drug kingpin. I was mouth agape and listening to what he was saying, and I was thinking, \u201cOh, my God!\u201d And I started thinking about it, like, \u201cIs this possible? Would this work in television?\u201d\nAnd it just so happened that the timing of this was perfect, because I think our society was getting more sophisticated with its viewing. Cable was exploding, and there were far more options for viewers. And so we realized you can\u2019t play it safe. You have to do something bold. [People] talk a lot about thinking outside the box and all those kind of things, but it was one of those rare occasions when it actually was just that. So I was just excited about being on board this new frontier.\nGilligan: I think people love an underdog because they identify with the underdog. It\u2019s funny, even the winners of the world \u2014 the billionaires, the top athletes, the movie stars. I\u2019m no psychologist, but there\u2019s some basic human thing that we all have within us, [where] we all wanna think of ourselves as an underdog. Not as a loser, but as an underdog. An underdog is a winner who at the moment is losing, but who is not, in fact, a loser. I don\u2019t think you can find that definition in Webster\u2019s, but that\u2019s the way I always thought of it.\nWalt actually treads a fine line. When I look back on the pilot, he is somewhere between an underdog and a loser. You feel for him because you think to yourself, \u201cThis guy is doing everything right.\u201d The first half of the pilot, this guy has done, as far as we can tell, everything right in life, and yet he keeps getting crapped on, right and left, by the vagaries of fate and by the people around him. He\u2019s got a family who loves him very much, but his fear is, \u201cHow am I gonna support these folks, even on a good day?\u201d Then, when he gets that cancer diagnosis, something just snaps in him. We identify with that underdog nature that he has in spades in that first hour.\nThen, there\u2019s Bryan Cranston\u2026 I did everything in my power as a writer to stack the deck for that particular character, so that the viewer would sympathize with Walter White. There are sympathize-able actors. There are actors who can be scary. There are actors who can be funny. Bryan really is the hat trick. He can do it all. I think a large part of the equation is Bryan himself and the humanity and the empathize-ability that he brought. He exuded it from every pore of his body. He brought that to the character and added so much likability to the character that the writing itself could never have attained on its own.\nBecause the show planned to take high school chemistry teacher Walt from \u201cMr. Chips to Scarface,\u201d as Gilligan explained early on, was there any concern that Walt would be too likable, too sympathetic, as he was introduced as a major underdog, so that it would be impossible for viewers to eventually turn on him?\nCranston: The thing the pilot does, and that was the master plan, is that despite your better judgment, you\u2019re saying, \u201cOh, but the poor bastard, he got a raw deal. \u2026 OK, just this once.\u201d If he does this one thing, then you can look the other way and forgive him for this, because you might have done the same thing if it was you, and you were on your way out and you wanted to do something.\nHere\u2019s a man who missed opportunities in his life, and he needs to leave something for his family, because it\u2019s going to be devastating and they\u2019ll be left penniless. So you justify your approval of what Walter White is doing. And by doing so, what Vince Gilligan was actually doing to the audience was baiting the hook. And in the pilot, the audience swallowed that bait. They felt compassion, concern for Walt, and rooted for him. Throughout all the danger and his decision making and his indecision and his doubt and his insecurities, we rooted for him, and that was by design.\nBecause once that bait was taken, and in the second and third episodes, and fourth episode and fifth episode, the bait is now dissolved, what\u2019s left in the audience? Just the hook, and at a certain point, the audience witnessing the evil deeds that Walter White was now doing. And it was beyond need now. He\u2019d already made his money, as he said, and he didn\u2019t really need to do more. Then it\u2019s, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I like him anymore, and he and Jesse are now arguing, and I\u2019m more on Jesse\u2019s side.\u201d And the audience will try to spit the hook out, and what happens is that it gets caught. So Vince, in all of his wisdom, would allow the audience to take the line out. I\u2019ll continue with the fishing analogy. Episode after episode, he\u2019s letting the audience run with the line. Out it goes, out it goes, out it goes. At a certain point \u2014 and it was different for everyone \u2014 where did your allegiance for Walt turn?\nSome say it was early on. Some say it was when he let Jane die. Some say it was when he killed so-and-so or killed Mike. It differs. But whenever that was for any particular audience member and they wanted to spit the hook, it got caught, as we knew it would. And that\u2019s when he clicked that reel and started pulling you in. And you know you didn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, God. Oh, I can\u2019t. What an a**hole he\u2019s become, and what\u2019s going on, and why is he\u2026?\u201d And we\u2019re reeling you in. And it was just a brilliant manipulation that you didn\u2019t see coming, because you didn\u2019t see the hook when you ate the bait. It just wasn\u2019t present. We thought we were feeling compassion and sorrow for a man, and what we were actually doing is buying a ticket for his trip to hell.\nAnd then there\u2019s Jesse, Walt\u2019s former student, who is introduced when Walt witnesses him climbing out the bedroom window of a naked woman, falling off the roof, and then quickly driving away from the scene of a DEA drug bust. Jesse doesn\u2019t say a word, but the look he and Walt exchange says they know each other, they\u2019re surprised to see other, and it\u2019s not a happy surprise.\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman): You can tell, there\u2019s obviously such history there. To be honest, before shooting the pilot, we didn\u2019t have any lengthy conversations about where this kid was from. I think it was pretty much on the page, and then my own interpretation, and, long story short, I think that\u2019s why I ended up landing the role because [of] my take on this kid. All I knew was within those 60 pages of that script, and the backstory I could kind of come up with.\nThis guy obviously wasn\u2019t very focused in school, he kind of got mixed up with the wrong crowd, and he is now cooking and selling crystal meth for a living. But, I didn\u2019t want to just make him the quintessential kind of druggie, burnt-out, bad guy. I wanted to give him some layers. And that\u2019s what really helped me out, because after we shot the pilot and got picked up, the whole journey for Jesse was changing, unbeknownst to me. The original plan was to kind of use Jesse Pinkman as a tool to bring Walter White into this world, and then he was gonna meet his demise toward the end of the first season, and then Walt would go out and have some sort of revenge. But, I had no idea that was the original plan. So these characters and these stories just kept evolving. Each time I received a new script, more layers of the onion were revealed to me.\nGilligan: Jesse Pinkman\u2019s character \u2026 that was something that tickled me, that I was looking forward to writing when I came up with the idea that this guy\u2019s a former student who failed Walt\u2019s chemistry class, but would wind up being his partner, and that these two guys basically hate each other. One thing that Bryan early on said to me was, \u201cThe way these buddy stories always go, these mismatched buddies, like Riggs and Murtaugh from \u201cLethal Weapon,\u201d they hate each other at the beginning. They wind up at the end, they love each other. The one guy invites the other over for Christmas dinner after the end of the two-hour thing.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna do that. I think Walt should never like or respect Jesse. I think he should hate this guy just as much at the end as he does at the start, and vice versa.\u201d We took that and ran with it as long as we could, although it felt, at a certain point, these guys gotta have some kind of a grudging respect for one another. But I respected what Bryan was saying. He was basically saying, \u201cLet\u2019s not soften these characters.\u201d Because that is a natural tendency that happens in a lot of these kind of stories. \u201cLet\u2019s try to go a different way.\u201d That was good advice.\nPaul: To be completely transparent, I was just so happy to be getting these scripts week to week, and there was really nothing I could say to make this show any better. So I was just happy that my character didn\u2019t die in a first-season episode. But it\u2019s true, everything was just so much more complicated and just honest with this show. And so it\u2019s good that Walt and Jesse didn\u2019t have that sort of best friend, \u201cAha!\u2019 moment. The waters were definitely a little muddy between those two throughout the series, which was, I think, very smart.\n\nMeet Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt, left), sister of Skyler White (Anna Gunn, center).\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Marie, Skyler White\u2019s sister, a quirky X-ray technician played by Betsy Brandt. Brandt also auditioned for the role of Skyler (and a woman named Linda, who was cut from the storyline) before she landed the role of Marie Schrader. Brandt was motivated by one word Gilligan said to her for creating her character.\nBetsy Brandt: One of the things that I love and respect about Vince so much as a writer is that he\u2019s so clear in his vision and so specific, and yet he\u2019s so open to where it goes. I just wanted to know everything that he thought about Marie. I remember he kept using the word \u201cneedle\u201d with her. He kept saying, \u201cShe needles Skyler. She needles her sister.\u201d He would always say, \u201cShe\u2019s not a bitch. It\u2019s just, she\u2019s not easy.\u201d To me, she\u2019s complicated, and that\u2019s what was so interesting about her. And I thought it would be just a fun ride to take.\nOne of my favorite things about the show is when you look at the pilot and the episodes in Season 1, you can then look at who these characters were in the last season of the show, and you see that\u2019s who they are in the beginning. We\u2019ve gotten to know them so much more, and the stakes are higher, and everything becomes more complicated, but I feel like you see who Marie is with her husband, her sister, her brother-in-law, her nephew. The roots of these people and the relationships to one another are, I just think, evident right out of the gate. And I always loved that about the show.\n\nWalter White, Jr. (RJ Mitte) at breakfast.\n\nTHE PILOT HIGHLIGHTS\n1. The White family breakfast on Walt\u2019s 50th birthday, including fake bacon (which Walt Jr. insists smells like a Band-Aid); playful banter about a janky hot water heater and how Walt is now old; and a sweet chemistry that made breakfast on Breaking Bad, especially Walt Jr.\u2019s love of the morning meal, a meme.\nRJ Mitte (Walter \u201cFlynn\u201d White, Jr.): You know what I remember most about pretty much most of the scenes, but that one in particular, was everyone\u2019s camaraderie. I miss the show, not just because of the show\u2019s content and what we did, but I miss working with the people that I had the privilege to work with, and the camaraderie that we had on the set. It really made the characters what they are. As I\u2019ve gotten older and filmed more and worked more, I really appreciate the professionalism that they brought to that. That was so crucial to the show.\nI think people gravitated towards [breakfast as a meme] because it was the only time in the series where there was no chaos. They were a normal family that sits down and eats with each other and talks, and those were big moments of happiness. I really think that\u2019s why people gravitated to those moments of innocence. And you\u2019re rooting for Walt. That evolution of doing what was right and doing what we want is something that we all struggle with. It\u2019s these transitions of: What do I need and what do I want, and what weighs more, my needs or my wants? For the most part, you were still [hoping] that Walt would come back to his family, that he would make all this money and find a cure for himself. In actuality, that didn\u2019t happen, but we were all hoping that it was going to be OK.\nBut they did eat a lot of fake bacon while filming the pilot, right?\nMitte: I did not. If you notice, my character doesn\u2019t really eat bacon in that shot, because he had smelled it. So that day, I didn\u2019t have bacon, but we did eat plenty at breakfast.\n2. The scene in the clothing store, when Walt stands up to some bullies who are making cruel remarks about Walt Jr. and his cerebral palsy. It\u2019s one of Walt\u2019s most heroic moments, and goes a long way toward establishing the audience\u2019s allegiance to him in the pilot.\nCranston: I think that was an awakening scene when we were trying jeans on in a store and some bullies were picking on my son. And before the cancer diagnosis, Walt would have handled it completely different. He would have backed down and just gotten his wife to leave the store, or try to tell the security guard to have these boys stop picking on us, or something of that nature. And the new Walt felt empowered by his decision-making that no one else knew about except him. And that struck me as very honest, that it infuses you with a new energy whenever you make bold choices. And it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re good choices; it means that it becomes very bold, but not always beneficial. And that\u2019s basically a taste of the direction that Walter White was going to take in his new life.\nMitte: To me that scene was very impactful because, one, it was one of my very first days being on set. It wasn\u2019t my first day, but it was one of those big days where it was like everyone\u2019s there. I had real [lines of] dialogue, [was] working and improving. \u2026 That really altered my perception of the industry. I also think that was that moment when you first saw [the] Heisenberg [persona], and that was so impactful in the story.\nIt definitely helped toward the bond [between Bryan and me]. [Walt] was standing up for Walt Jr., and that was one of those really special moments where you can connect with an individual you are working with, and you can have that moment with them, and it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s cool to be able to create that real family, because we really are a family. I can go and call anyone [in the cast] and have a chat. We don\u2019t do that all the time, but we have the ability to do that with each other, and that is something that is hard to find. There\u2019s not many people that I\u2019ve had that with.\n\nJesse (Aaron Paul) pays Krazy-8 (Max Arciniega) and his attack dog a visit.\n\n3. Jesse visits his drug-dealing cohort Krazy-8, who\u2019s training a scary-looking attack dog (who turned out to be quite a pussycat).\nMax Arciniega (Krazy-8): The funny part about it was that we did our first take, and the dog started biting on the dummy. As soon as we cut, the dog was literally exhausted. And so the dog trainer came over and grabbed this supposedly vicious Rottweiler, and took him over to get some water. He was panting like he was out of shape. So he\u2019s there, panting and panting, and Vince was like, \u201cOh, OK. So, is the dog ready?\u201d And the trainer was like, \u201cNo. He\u2019s going to need a break.\u201d And Vince was like, \u201cWhat are we thinking, like how long?\u201d The trainer was like, \u201cProbably about 25 minutes.\u201d Vince was like, \u201cTwenty-five minutes? Oh, OK.\u201d So this vicious Rottweiler was literally just this out-of-shape teddy bear. That was one of the cool memories about that experience there. You could go up and pet him. He was such a sweet dog. He was a good actor, right?\nPaul: I remember loving that dog. The dog was great. I think he just was very happy to bark for some treats.\n\nCranston in Walt\u2019s tighty-whities.\n\nTHE UNDERPANTS\nAs would continue throughout the series, the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d pilot was full of memorably funny dialogue, situations, and physical moments, from Jesse describing \u201ccow houses\u201d to Skyler\u2019s bemusement at Marie\u2019s offer to critique her writing, to, in one of the enduringly iconic images of the series, Walt in the desert in his tighty-whities. Many viewers were used to seeing Cranston in the white briefs from his time on \u201cMalcolm in the Middle,\u201d which is exactly why Walt almost wore sweatpants instead.\nGilligan: I love \u201cMalcolm in the Middle,\u201d but I have to admit that I certainly didn\u2019t see every episode, and I had, in fact, forgotten that Bryan\u2019s character of Hal had spent so much time, not just in his underpants, but in his tighty-whities. I had written the tighty-whities stuff right from the get-go, before I even had an actor in mind. I had an image of a guy in tighty-whities, in the desert, with the gas mask and all that stuff.\nCranston: I brought it to his attention because it was in the script. And he didn\u2019t know that that was sort of a signature piece of Hal. So if he had, then I would have thought, \u201cOh, maybe just subliminally he put that in there.\u201d But because he didn\u2019t know, I went, \u201cOh, OK. Well\u2026\u201d Then that\u2019s when I was objective; when I was looking at the choice of wardrobe and things, and I\u2019m saying, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to repeat that. That wouldn\u2019t be smart.\u201d\nGilligan: I kinda wimped out on the morning of filming, and I said, \u201cAre you OK with the tighty-whities?\u201d He said, \u201cVersus what?\u201d I said, \u201cWell\u2026 I guess [Walt] could\u2019ve brought a pair of sweatpants or something he could be wearing. He doesn\u2019t have to be in his underpants.\u201d\nCranston: And so I\u2019m looking at all different kinds of boxers and things like that, and something was kind of gnawing at me. The choice was, \u201cYeah, I guess we could go with boxers.\u201d And I kept going, \u201cWhy did he write that? Why was that image in his head when he wrote that? Because he didn\u2019t have an association with \u2018Malcolm in the Middle,\u2019 so what was it?\u201d And I asked him, and he didn\u2019t know. He just thought the image was funny. And it is. Tighty-whities on a grown man is funny, and that\u2019s primarily why I wasn\u2019t going to do that again, because I had done that for seven years.\nAnd so I was convinced that I was not going to do that. And then as I\u2019m working on the character, I always try to find the emotional core, and that\u2019s where the seed is, to be able to then nurture that character and have it grow out of that. And with Walt, it was depression.\nA lot of what Walt was doing was out of depression, not out of emotion, because his emotional core was calloused over by years of indifference and disappointment. And I thought, this is kind of indicative of a halting maturity. Walt gave up at some point 20 years ago, when he became a teacher. He gave up maybe his own destiny, maybe something, but he didn\u2019t care anymore. And so, that then informed a lot of decisions. That created the mustache that was so transparent that it looked silly. It wasn\u2019t full, it didn\u2019t really make any statement, the hair was muted brown. We took any color highlights out of my hair and deadened the color. We chose clothes that were the colors of walls: taupe, sand, beige, eggshell white. He blended [in], he became invisible to society and to himself.\nAnd then I went back to the underwear situation and I went, \u201cWell, you know what? I think this kind of tells our story, that he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d His growth as an adult, as a human being, stunted at a certain point. When I looked at Hal, it was funny in that context that he was just the biggest boy of the family. Whereas in this context, it was even more depressing. And so I thought, wouldn\u2019t that be interesting, to take the same exact underwear in a comedy to make [the character] funny and in a drama to make it depressing or sad?\nKathleen Detoro (costume designer): They came from JCPenney, because they did not have a logo on them. I don\u2019t really like having any logos on stuff. I don\u2019t want to be advertising anything in particular. If there is a logo, I would take it off. But, with men\u2019s underwear, it is usually stitched into the waistband. And I had to figure out a way for him to be able to stick a gun in his underwear. It would usually go in the back of the waistband of their pants. So we figured out a way to do that so the gun would be OK.\nAnd he came out, and he took a bow in his underwear in front of everyone. We would just acknowledge the underwear scene, and he could focus on it. And that scene is so amazing. The whole thing is brilliant. And it was a billboard. I think it was on Sunset Boulevard. When I saw it, I just laughed so much, because I think it was of him in his underwear in the green shirt on the road in the desert. And I was like, \u201cOh, wow. Who would have thought, back when I had that meeting about the [underwear], that this would be above the Chateau Marmont?\nPaul: Bryan really knows how to wear his tighty-whities, you know? I haven\u2019t worn tighty-whities since I was a young little boy. But, Bryan \u2026 that\u2019s his underwear of choice. I don\u2019t know if he told you that, but he loves those things. Actually, that could be a lie. I have no idea.\nGilligan: The guy was so absolutely fearless.\nBecause the underpants are associated with two of his signature characters, has Cranston ever been approached about being a spokesman for the briefs?\nCranston: No. [Laughs] That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been asked about that. With Hal, unless they did it tongue in cheek. \u2026 Hal did not make tighty-whities sexy. And Walter White just kind of gave it a nastiness that I don\u2019t think wholesome underwear companies would want to be a part of.\n\nBrandt in Marie\u2019s signature shade of purple.\n\nTHE COLOR PURPLE\nColor played a huge role in \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d from the colors of the Albuquerque sky and desert to the characters\u2019 clothing and cars to, of course, Walt and Jesse\u2019s famous blue crystal meth. Blogs were devoted to dissecting the color schemes of the characters\u2019 wardrobes, and what the evolution of those colors meant. One character who made a statement by never changing her color: Marie, who loved anything and everything purple, from both outfits we see her wearing in the pilot to, eventually, even her kitchen appliances (who knew you could buy a purple toaster?).\nBrandt: In the beginning, Marie only had a few scenes. I just wanted to be as specific about her as I could and know as much about her as I could. Just because there wasn\u2019t a lot of material, I was kind of looking for stuff. I always said Kathleen Detoro\u2019s superpower is color \u2014 we all had colors. I just said, \u201cYou know what? I think Marie is that person.\u201d\nI just kept thinking about what Vince said about her needling [people]. I felt like she\u2019s so tightly wound. In my head, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think she does anything half-assed.\u201d So I think if purple is her color, purple is her color. And Vince thought that was great. Then that first season, he and the writers, they just went with it, really so much more than I ever could have imagined. And I just loved that for her. I mean, her entire house. She doesn\u2019t live alone. [Hank] is like, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d It\u2019s so much easier just to accept everything is purple than to fight her on it. That tells us so much about her.\nI was like, \u201cOK, so she\u2019s not easy in other ways, too.\u201d And [before] the pilot, I asked Vince, \u201cWhat do you think she does for a living?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d I said, \u201cI think that she is an X-ray technician, or maybe an insurance adjuster.\u201d He said, \u201cOK, I like that. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d I wanted her to have some foot in the door in the medical field, but I didn\u2019t want her to be a doctor. I didn\u2019t want her to be a nurse. I wanted her to not have too much power. I wanted her to be able to have a chip on her shoulder.\nFans must have sent all kinds of purple gifts. Did Brandt ever get sick of the color?\nOh, my god, there is no purple in my house. Except for my daughter\u2019s bedroom, because she doesn\u2019t have to pay for my creative choices. Since then, when I do any other project, not to tell anybody how to do their job, but I say, \u201cPlease, very limited purple, or no purple.\u201d It\u2019s just a different person to me. And yes, I still get all sorts of purple stuff. When we did our premiere, I can\u2019t remember which season it was, at [San Diego] Comic-Con, there were all these women who showed up in purple. It was just beyond touching. To me, those are the amazing meetings that you have with people that are fans of the show, because they have lived it with you. It\u2019s those experiences that are a privilege. It\u2019s a privilege to be in someone\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cWe gotta clean this up.\u201d\n\nETC., ETC.\nAaron Paul\u2019s favorite memory from filming the pilot?\nPaul: This is the perfect point to segue back to Bryan in his underwear. Bryan walking around in his tighty-whities. \u2026 He really just owned them. He was very confident. He would just be walking around set in the middle of the desert, with an umbrella kind of shading his body and his face from the sun, just in his loafers and in his tighty-whities, a beautiful sight. I just remember Bryan having all of us in tears from laughter. And, it was that way through the entire series. He was truly the anchor that culled us all together.\nWe\u2019re celebrating the pilot here, but fans continue to debate the series\u2019 ending. Does Paul think Jesse is alive?\nPaul: I hope so. But if you really look at the evidence, his fingerprints are all over the place. He has a record. So, they\u2019re definitely gonna be searching for him. He is on the run, you know? He did murder someone, probably the nicest person on Breaking Bad, poor Gale. And he did get punished and abused for some time. So, I don\u2019t know. I like to think that he kind of ran off, [is] maybe hiding out in Alaska somewhere, maybe building things with his hands, I don\u2019t know. But, he\u2019s definitely in hiding somewhere, for sure.\nWould he ever want that question answered definitively, by Gilligan and the Breaking Badwriters?\nPaul: Oh God, I have no idea, but all I will say is, if for some reason Vince decides to have Pinkman pop up anywhere \u2026 whatever Vince asks me to do, I\u2019m just gonna smile at him and nod my head yes. I owe him so much, and I know that he would never do anything to harm or jeopardize what he had created in the first place and what we all were very much a huge part of creating. So yeah, if that did happen, I can say with confidence that it would be done in a very delicate, delicate way.\nBreaking Bad was originally going to be set in Riverside, Calif., but execs asked Gilligan to consider filming in New Mexico for budget purposes. He does not regret his decision to say yes.\nGilligan: The Sony production executives called me up one day as we were plotting out the pilot and said, \u201cWhat do you think about Albuquerque?\u201d I don\u2019t know if they said Albuquerque, to be fair. I think they said, \u201cWhat do you think about shooting in New Mexico?\u201d They said, \u201cYou could put license plates on the cars that say California. What\u2019s the difference? California kinda looks like New Mexico.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy would we do this again?\u201d And, they said, \u201cBecause you\u2019ll have a lot more money to play with. You\u2019ll have a lot more money with which to make the show, because New Mexico is offering quite a good inducement in terms of a rebate package.\u201d One of the things I\u2019m proudest of is that I said, \u201cYes, but we\u2019re not gonna put California license plates on, and we\u2019re not gonna never look East to avoid seeing the Sandia Mountains. Let\u2019s just call it Albuquerque, N.M. Let\u2019s call it what it is.\u201d\nBecause, unfortunately, as we all know, there\u2019s not one state that has a lock on the meth problem. It\u2019s pretty much all 50 of them. I figured New Mexico\u2019s as good as any place. It turned out to be one of the greatest boons to the show and what people love about the show. In other words, Southern California, it\u2019s a lot of tract homes, and it\u2019s a lot of people, millions and millions of people \u2014 it would have to be a show set in a city, really, which is a very different feel. I only realized how different it was in hindsight, once we started shooting in Albuquerque.\nIn Albuquerque, you\u2019re surrounded by plains, and deserts, and mountains, and a landscape that is, on the one hand, beautiful, but on the other hand, is dead set on killing you if you let it. You wander just a few miles from your house in some places in Albuquerque without water on a hot day, and you will die. It is a deadly landscape. That comes across so wonderfully onscreen. It becomes, in essence, a contemporary Western. I didn\u2019t even realize how much I was gonna love that until we actually started seeing it on film. The best thing we really got from shooting in Albuquerque was shooting in Albuquerque.\n\nMarie and Hank at Walt\u2019s birthday party.\n\nWhen Marie met Hank\u2026\nBrandt: I met [Dean Norris] the first time when I came into meet with Vince. Dean was in the waiting room. There were other actors in there, too. Not many. It wasn\u2019t a large group, but I just started talking to Dean. We just started chatting. And I remember, I asked him what network it was on. Then I said, \u201cI think this is funny. Is this funny?\u201d Because it\u2019s an hour [drama]. And he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, yeah. Yeah.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m going in there reading this as funny.\u201d I said, \u201cOK, good, because I am, too.\u201d We both said afterwards, \u201cOh, I went in and definitely played the comedy more because of our conversation.\u201d Everything just came together on this for me. I can\u2019t speak for everybody else, but I feel like this show is full of those stories, that everything just fell into place. I think it is the definition of lightning in a bottle.\nWe still want to know more about Marie and Skyler\u2019s background, their childhoods. Wouldn\u2019t it make a great story, or a book, or a prequel season or series?\nBrandt: If you get that show produced, I will do it. I will do a season of Skyler and Marie. It\u2019s funny, Anna and I would talk about how, \u201cGod, don\u2019t you want to meet their parents?\u201d We had talked about that with Vince. Vince was like, \u201cOh!\u201d He had ideas about it. But it\u2019s cable. You never get to explore as much as you want, because you just don\u2019t have the episodes.\n\nKrazy-8 threatens to kill Walt.\n\nWhat does Max Arciniega think about the fact that his name was used for a pivotalBreaking Bad character, Max Arciniega, Gustavo Fring\u2019s best friend and original partner in Los Pollos Hermanos? Max the character was murdered by the Mexican cartel, sparking Gus\u2019s quest for revenge against Don Eladio and Hector Salamanca.\nArciniega: I was aware that Vince Gilligan tends to name characters after people that he knows and likes. So I got a call from Vince, and he\u2019s like, \u201cHey, listen. I was thinking about naming one of the characters after you, and just wanted to know if that was OK?\u201d And I was like, \u201cAbsolutely. I would be honored. That\u2019s amazing.\u201d And so it was as simple as that. I remember, I had some family members who were big fans of the show. They didn\u2019t know, and no one else knew about it. I had never said anything. I started getting phone calls, and they\u2019re like, \u201cThey named a character after you!\u201d It was an honor.\nAll five seasons of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d are now streaming on Netflix.\nVince Gilligan is currently in production on the fourth season of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d spin-off \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d\nBryan Cranston is currently starring in a stage adaptation of the 1976 film \u201cNetwork\u201d at the National Theater in London, and in the Amazon Prime series \u201cPhilip K.

I was walking home from work with four other kids. We were pin-boys at the Armory Bowling Alley, in Chester, Pa. Before automation, we pin boys reset the pins after the bowling balls knocked them down.\nIt was about 11 p.m. All of a sudden, a police car pulled along side us, then in front of us, blocking the walk. We stopped in our tracks and watched wide eyed while the two cops got out of their car, nightsticks in hand and approached us.\n\"Where you boys going? Where you coming from? What you got in your pockets?\" We each answered their questions and they questioned our answers. \"What time did you get off? How much did you make? Where do you live?\" While one cop stood guard, the other one frisked each of us; hands moving up and down our bodies and inside every pocket.\nNeither cop was nasty or forceful. In fact, the whole thing was happening in a light-hearted manner. I even remember laughing, nervously, at something that was said during my search.\nIn a few minutes, they let us go. But our mood had changed. We were silent and sullen. None of us complained about it or ever mentioned it again, but I remember feeling violated. I remember asking myself why they stopped us. We weren't doing anything wrong. We weren't loud or destructive. We weren't criminals. We were simply five black kids, walking in a white area of town, at night.

Mr. Museveni is in his fifth presidential term. Credit Ben Curtis/Associated Press\n\nNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 After months of heated, sometimes violent debate, Uganda\u2019s Parliament voted late Wednesday to lift the age limit for the presidency, setting the stage for President Yoweri Museveni to rule the country indefinitely.\nMr. Museveni is in his fifth presidential term, which expires in 2021. By then, he will be 77 \u2014 two years past the age limit for a president set by Uganda\u2019s 1995 Constitution.\nA majority of lawmakers supported the bill, which passed 315 to 62 late Wednesday night, but a majority of Ugandans opposed it. A September poll by Afrobarometer found that 75 percent of respondents wanted to keep the age limit.\nOnce Mr. Museveni signs the bill, it will become law. It is expected to be challenged in court.\nThe final days of parliamentary debate on the bill included accusations that soldiers were hiding inside Parliament\u2019s chapel, where some lawmakers said they uncovered dishware and bottles filled with urine, suggesting that the soldiers may have planned an extended stay.\n\u201cThe process is a military coup,\u201d said Joe Oloka-Onyango, a professor of constitutional law at Makerere University in Kampala, the capital. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely illegitimate and illegal. It has been surrounded by violence and intimidation.\u201d\nIn late September, Betty Nambooze, a member of Parliament who opposed the bill, was attacked inside a government building by unidentified men. She spent a month in the hospital and was eventually flown to India for surgery.\nOne person was killed in street protests in October and two members of Parliament were hospitalized after inhaling tear gas at a rally held after the police banned \u201cillegal\u201d public demonstrations on the matter.\nMr. Museveni\u2019s supporters said the bill would eliminate age discrimination in electoral politics, but critics said that argument was a red herring.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not even about age,\u201d Mr. Oloka-Onyango said. \u201cIt\u2019s about accommodating Museveni\u2019s ego and lust for power. At each instance, he has changed the goal posts that would have led to his peaceful replacement.\u201d\nIn 2005, as Mr. Museveni\u2019s second \u2014 and, by the old rules, final \u2014 term neared its end, Parliament abolished the presidential term limit. His electoral victories since then have drawn legal challenges.\n\u201cThe writing was always on the wall, but unfortunately we didn\u2019t read it closely enough,\u201d said Jacqueline Asiimwe, a lawyer and feminist activist. \u201cThe original intent was to rule for life.\u201d\nThe bill will also lower the age of eligibility for president, to 18 from 35, but young people in Uganda nevertheless vocally opposed it, and they form Uganda\u2019s biggest constituency. Nearly 70 percent of the country\u2019s population is under 25. A majority of them are unemployed, and they have known only one president: Mr. Museveni came to power in 1986, after his rebel group toppled an authoritarian leader.\n\u201cI\u2019m scared for my future,\u201d said Godiva Akullo, 27, a lawyer in Kampala who opposed the bill. \u201cWhen will this country be a place that I am proud to live and work in? Will my children, if I have any, be in this same position I am in, as the child of my parents: Will they wonder what I did when this man was doing all this?\u201d\nThe bill has its roots in a challenge to Mr. Museveni\u2019s 2016 election victory. In a ruling that affirmed his victory, the Supreme Court laid out areas for electoral reform before the next campaign.\nNone had to do with the president\u2019s age.\n\u201cThe fundamental point is that for a long time, we\u2019ve been talking about a review of some of the constitutional provisions that are important for ensuring we have a stronger democratic culture,\u201d said Richard Sewakiryanga, executive director of the Uganda National NGO Forum in Kampala, a nonpartisan watchdog group. \u201cThat\u2019s the genesis.\u201d\nBut Wednesday\u2019s vote, Mr. Sewakiryanga said, is just about keeping Mr. Museveni in power.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other way of seeing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one-way traffic.\u201d\nLydia Namubiru contributed reporting from Kampala, Uganda."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article reports on Ugandan political developments \u2014 a constitutional amendment and related protests and debate \u2014 and contains no discussion of scientific studies, research methods, or findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_69"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "1310.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["24hourproject : Three Stories from Three Cities"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["This article originally appeared on Grryo.\njeff kelley | northampton, ma, USA\nI think the last time I tried to stay up for 24 hours straight was circa 1993, during my freshman year of college. The results then were less than stellar, I ended up falling asleep in my dorm room and missing my Italian midterm. Thankfully, this time, I did a little better. I started out with a 1.5 hour nap at 10:30pm and then it was off to Northampton, Massachusetts to meet up with my friend.\n\n'Sup and Pup'\nOur biggest hurdle was not the struggle to stay awake, but rather, one we were aware of beforehand: finding opportunities to shoot in a small town. Armed with this knowledge, I created a Google doc and tried to make a note of places that would be open, or have good light at various hours of the day. Aside from having a goal of successfully completing the project, I set a few other personal goals as well. The first was simple: to take better pictures than I had in years past.\n\n'Leading in the Poles'\nMy other two goals related to the types of pictures I wanted to try and take. I have never successfully done a \"street portrait\"- One in which you ask a stranger for their picture. @365ken has been a role model for this kind of photo. The other style of shot is a bit harder to describe. It involves finding creative juxtapositions or situations and catching them on film. For this type of shot, I was most influenced by @powercorruptionandlikes.\n\n'Reader's Block'\nAll in all, I was happy with how everything went. I pushed my photography a little further, didn't fall asleep on the job, and had a good time. Will I do it again next year? Well as my Italian professor taught me to say, \"vedremo\" (\"we shall see\"). At least I'm assuming that's what she taught me. I can't actually remember any Italian whatsoever.\n..\n giulia macario | melbourne, australia\n24 hours of continuous photography with no sleep whatsoever, who would sign up for that? Ahem. me. Three times. What on earth was i thinking....\nLike other years I left it up until the day of the event, and a few hours before, to really make up my mind on whether I was participating or not. That being said, I always seemed to get pulled in by the lure of taking part in such a fantastic worldwide event and being part of something bigger than myself. This year was no exception, and after being inspired by many talented photographer friends from all over the world in years passed, I again took part.\n\n'Ghosts of Piers Past'\nSo why do it? I guess for me after nearly 8 months of not shooting anything, this was a way to kick my butt into photography gear again. They say practice, practice, practice... is the best way. And for me, not a 'seasoned' street shooter - it's definitely a challenge. I do not plan my shots or where i'll be hour by hour, I believe theres a magic to letting moments just happen, and if they dont, well, I just move on. I wasn't too concerned with fitting the mold of what was expected as a street shooter for my hourly posts, or sticking to a style, for me it was more about capturing a feeling using my way of seeing, whether it simply be a blur of colour, a fractured slow shutter experiment or a rush of red going by.\n\n'Sketches'\n\n'Rush by Red'\nThe days before March 19 I had done a list of places and locations potentially interesting in my city, and done kinds of photographic rehearsals in different moments of the day to check what I would have found in terms of situations and light. And I had more or less planned the 24 Hours itinerary to optimize travelling time both by transports and on foot. I generally edit my images in black and white: interminable edits with frequent rethinks. To simplify this aspect I decided to shoot only with my iPhone 6s, using a default Hipsta bw combo (John S lens+ AO BW film+ Standard flash), limiting the manual edit just to a few steps.\n\n'Metaphysical Space'\nAlthough it was my first 24 hour project, I wasn't particularly anxious about the unavoidable tiredness due to sleep deprivation, but rather about the need to continuously focus on people as subjects. Most of my shots are usually taken in the street and people are always present as the main subject, but I'm not confident with candid portraits and didn't feel at ease with the idea of improvising a new style. So the most critical aspect to me was the idea to keep on documenting humanity in my own way. But after the first image of this photographic marathon, taken after some hesitation and a tension which was for me unusual, I felt it would be possible. And started to relax about the \"style\" issue.\n\n'The Common Reader '\nThe night was supposed to be the most difficult part of this marathon in terms of available subjects . That's why I had planned, hour by hour, an itinerary . But I didn't allow for the unexpected. Between 1 and 2 AM I had decided on a shot outside the emergency room of one of the major hospitals in town. I had imagined traffic due to ambulances and people going in and out. So you can imagine my total surprise when I didn't find at all what I was ready to take a shot of. One of the most quiet and sane nights in town. No ambulances, no people in need of a visit. Nothing. At last I took a shot of a biker who turned out to be a nocturnal worker at the hospital. A shot apparently taken in the middle of nowhere.\n\n'Night Shift'\nThis wasn't the only unexpected situation I had to face during the marathon. For instance, I found no living soul in the 24 hour supermarket, and a military parade in the most famous square of the city, piazza Duomo, right where I had planned to shoot people idly sitting on the churchyard. There were no art watchers at the photo exhibition, and no street carts when I would have needed them. Many shots couldn't be posted because they were taken too early or too late. But I think this need for improvisation in a bunch of minutes, after so much planning, was the cool part of the story and what still makes me satisfied with my performance. A new chapter next year, no doubt about that. So rather than echoing Jeff saying \"We Shall See,\" I am for \" You Will See\".\n\n'Make a Wish'\nIf you'd like to learn more about the 24 Hour Project, visit their website: 24hourproject.org"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.95", "GPT Reasoning: The article is a personal narrative about a 24-hour photography project, discussing goals, experiences, and photos\u2014there is no mention of scientific studies, research methods, data, or findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_70"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "1013.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Emily Ingram | HuffPost"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["\u00a92018 Oath Inc.

She was about six weeks along and went out for pizza. She didn\u2019t feel great, but she managed to eat a slice or two. The next day, everything changed. Every single food she put in her mouth came right back up. Every single smell made her nauseated. \nJohnson went to her doctor for answers and was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), a condition marked by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dehydration during pregnancy. Johnson had them all. Two weeks after she was diagnosed, she was hospitalized for severe dehydration. Soon after she went into the hospital again, this time staying for almost a month. Johnson eventually required a home nurse who helped her get all of her nutrition intravenously, and was hooked up to a portable pump that gave her a constant stream of anti-nausea medication. She did not consume any actual food for more than a month.\n\u201cI remember one day I got back from the grocery store and I was so weak, all I could do was get to the front door. Then I crawled to the bathroom and laid there \u2015 after dry heaving \u2015 with my cheek on the tile floor,\u201d she recalled. \u201cTwo hours later, that\u2019s how my husband found me. The door to the house was wide open. The car door was open. He saw my feet hanging out the door and thought I was dead.\u201d\nHyperemesis gravidarum is back in the news with the announcement that Kate Middleton \u2015 the world\u2019s most famous HG sufferer \u2015 is pregnant with her third child and once again struggling with the condition, cancelling planned appearances and missing the first day of school with her son on Thursday. While Middleton has done more than just about anyone to draw attention to HG, some are still quick to dismiss her diagnosis as nothing more than an overblown excuse to lay low. \u201cWhy the fuss over morning sickness?\u201d said one commenter on The Daily Mail. Headlines and articles have unwittingly downplayed the seriousness of HG by labeling it \u201csevere morning sickness.\u201d\nPeople have this notion that everbody exaggerates everything, but in this situation you don't have to exaggerate. It's as bad as you can imagine.\nBut as the harrowing pregnancies of moms like Johnson make clear, describing HG as simply a more intense version of the nausea and vomiting most pregnant women encounter is not only dismissive; it\u2019s potentially dangerous. And it means that many moms-to-be end up suffering alone.\n\u201cYou just want to yell at people, \u2018It\u2019s not the same!\u2019\u201d Johnson said. \u201cPeople have this notion that everybody exaggerates everything, but in this situation you don\u2019t have to exaggerate. It\u2019s as bad as you can imagine.\u201d\nNOT morning sickness\nSoon after the latest royal pregnancy was announced, HuffPost Parents posted a callout on its Facebook page looking for women willing to talk about their experiences with HG. Within 24 hours, more than 100 e-mails poured in. Women called themselves \u201cHG survivors\u201d and described battles with extreme weight loss and vomiting more than 20 times a day. Again and again they emphasized one point: Morning sickness and HG are not the same thing.\nCertainly morning sickness \u2015 which affects roughly 70 percent of moms in the first trimester \u2015 can be hard, but it\u2019s generally not harmful for women or their babies and tends to fade. HG, on the other hand, absolutely puts women and babies at risk. These are the moms-to-be who vomit more than three to four times a day, who are unable to keep down any food and who lose more than 5 percent of their pre-pregnancy weight. The Oregon-based Hyperemesis Education and Research Foundation (HER) says these women tend to have nutritional deficiencies and metabolic imbalances that can be life-threatening.\nI honestly thought we were dying. I'd cry, but was so dehydrated I had no tears...I was vomiting so hard I hit my head on the toilet and passed out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest feelings to describe,\u201d a mom who was hospitalized 14 times in the first half of her pregnancy wrote in an e-mail to HuffPost. \u201cFeeling like you\u2019re going to die at any given moment is an understatement. It literally changes your life \u2014 being so tired your muscles hurt, so dehydrated your head pounds non-stop, getting so used to throwing up you can feel it a mile away.\u201d \u201cI honestly thought we where dying,\u201d another wrote. \u201cI\u2019d cry, but was so dehydrated I had no tears. At one point I was vomiting so hard I hit my head on the toilet and passed out.\u201d That woman lost her job and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.\nCarla Rose, 30, a single mother of now 1-and-a-half-year-old twins, told HuffPost that she was forced to go to the hospital two to three times a week to get IV nutrition and fluids. Early on in her pregnancy, she was vomiting more than 20 times a day. By her second trimester, Rose was on a cocktail of medication that limited her vomiting to five or six episodes daily, but she never reached a point when she was not regularly throwing up. At 25 weeks, she went on complete bedrest and took leave from her teaching job after passing out in the classroom. She was so weak, she often relied on a wheelchair to get around.\n\u201cThe only thing you can think about is how terrible you feel,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI would live on the bathroom floor because I could not stop vomiting. I was literally green. Like, people would come up to me and say \u2018Your skin color is green.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMy girls are beautiful and healthy,\u201d she added, \u201cbut they ate me alive.\u201d\nNo clear answers\nCurrent estimates suggest that between 0.3 and 2.3 percent of all pregnant women experience HG, though it\u2019s possible the numbers are higher because some women don\u2019t seek treatment for it. The HER Foundation\u2019s executive director Kimber MacGibbon, a registered nurse and an HG survivor herself, told HuffPost the site gets half a million visitors every year and has more than 13,000 followers on Facebook. \nThe hormones associated with pregnancy \u2015 namely estrogen \u2015 are thought to play a key role, though MacGibbon told HuffPost researchers are increasingly interested in the role that genetics play. A 2010 study also found that HG may be hereditary to some degree, but the exact causes remain unknown. MacGibbon did note that having a seemingly healthy (and obviously privileged) woman like Kate Middleton become the public face of HG has at least helped debunk the notion that it\u2019s caused by women not taking care of themselves or looking to get attention. \nIt\u2019s really impossible for a woman without complications to comprehend the turmoil we live through.\nTreatment options do exist \u2015 generally through IV nutrition and fluids, as well as prescription anti-vomiting medications \u2015 but full relief isn\u2019t on the table. The goal is to keep mom and baby safe from serious complications like low birth weight, thyroid and liver problems and the kind of severe dehydration that can hospitalize women for weeks on end.\n\u201cYou can treat it, but treatment doesn\u2019t equal zero symptoms,\u201d MacGibbon said.\nAbout half of women find their symptoms subside by the time they\u2019re midway through their pregnancy, while the rest struggle the whole time. But women in both groups say the memories of HG \u2015 of hour upon hour spent vomiting on the floor, or finishing a pregnancy weighing less than they did when it began \u2015 stay with them for a long time. \nTake Robyn, a 47-year-old who asked that only her first name be used, who vomited violently throughout all three of her pregnancies, but had particularly severe HG with her second in 1991. She had to carry around a bucket for her spit because she threw up every time she swallowed. More than 20 years later, she can still recall how she would dry heave for 15 minutes at a stretch, breaking all of the blood vessels in and around her eyes. Or how she\u2019d sit helplessly with her head over a bucket, letting her saliva stream down so she wouldn\u2019t have to throw up again.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone truly understands it unless they live it or live with a woman who has it,\u201d Robyn said. \u201cIt\u2019s really impossible for a woman without complications to comprehend the turmoil we live through.\u201d\n\n6 Unexpected Ways Your Body Changes After Pregnancy\n 1 / 6 \nYou can't seem to get rid of your belly\nIt's no surprise that for many women, muscles in their abdomen separate to accommodate the baby. The thing is, it can stay that way after birth. When the bands of muscles, which run parallel down your belly, separate, they leave behind a space in between, a condition called diastasis recti. Without the ab muscles in the middle of your belly to hold everything in, you might see a bulge or ridge of soft tissue there, aka a pooch that just won't go away. In fact, one-third of women still had it even one year postpartum, reported a  in the . \"Some women are alarmed that they can lean forward or do a sit-up and see this bulge in between these muscles,\" explains Jonathan Schaffir, MD, an ob-gyn at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Though weak ab muscles can lead to back pain, in general they don't cause medical issues. Exercise is often recommended\u2014some studies show that moves targeting deep ab muscles called the transverse abdominal muscles (like bird-dogs and pelvic tilts) may help\u2014however, the jury is still out on exactly what you need to do or how much it speeds healing, suggests a  analyzing eight studies. Unfortunately, there's no slam-dunk treatment, hence why in severe cases some women correct the condition with surgery.\nmediaphotos/iStock"]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.85", "GPT Reasoning: The article is a human-interest/health news piece focused on a patient story and public reaction to hyperemesis gravidarum, not reporting on scientific studies, research methods, or findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_74"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "1089.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Obama Makes Big Move For Transgender Rights"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["President Barack Obama on Friday expanded protections for transgender individuals in the health care system.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Transgender individuals gained new legal protections against discrimination by health insurance companies and medical providers under a regulation published Friday.\nThe health care rules stem from anti-discrimination provisions in the Affordable Care Act, designed to prevent unfair treatment based on sex, gender identity and sexual orientation. They are the latest step President Barack Obama has taken to extend civil rights protections for transgender people.\nMost recently, the Obama administration has challenged a North Carolina law mandating individuals use public bathrooms that correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth, and notified public schools they risk losing federal funds if they impose similar requirements on students.\nUnder the new regulations, transgender people are guaranteed equal treatment by insurers and medical providers, and will have the right to make civil rights claims against those that deny them coverage or necessary care because they are transgender. That includes forbidding health insurers from categorically excluding treatments related to gender transitions, although it doesn't mandate those procedures be covered.\nThe rules will take effect in 60 days and apply to any health care provider or health insurance company that receives federal funds, and to state Medicaid agencies and the Obamacare health insurance exchange marketplaces.\n\"Today\u2019s announcement is a key step toward realizing equity within our health care system and reaffirms this administration's commitment to giving every American access to the health care they deserve,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a press release. \nAdvocates for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities praised the new rules.\n\"LGBT people have too often faced healthcare systems that provide inequitable and hostile treatment. This new and important regulation will address many of these disparities and is critical to help end discrimination against transgender and gender nonconforming people in healthcare and insurance,\" Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a press release.\nHistorically, transgender people have faced extraordinary barriers to health insurance and medical treatments. \nSome health insurance companies refuse to cover treatments related to transitioning, such as hormone therapy and mental health services, and some medical providers deny treatment to transgender people. A 2015 survey revealed that more than 40 percent of female-to-male transgender people have experienced discrimination in the health care system.\nLGBT people have too often faced healthcare systems that provide inequitable and hostile treatment. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin\nUnder federal law, sexual orientation isn't what's called a \"protected class\" -- meaning it's still legal to discriminate against people for being gay. While the new regulations don't change that, they offer limited protections for LGBT people by barring discrimination based on \"sex stereotyping,\" which is when someone is treated differently because that person doesn't behave ways consistent with their perceived gender identity (for example, discriminating against a man because he has \"feminine\" characteristics).\nBroadly, the rules prohibit discrimination based on sex; pregnancy, childbirth and related conditions; gender identity; and sex stereotyping. Patients also gain the right to make a civil rights complaint when they believe discrimination has occurred.\nHealth insurance companies can't refuse anyone's business, deny claims for services covered by their plans, charge more for care or otherwise discriminate in their treatment of customers based on sex and those other considerations. Likewise, physicians, hospitals and other medical providers must provide equal access to health care services to everyone, regardless of sex or gender identity or sex stereotyping.\nBecause the rules apply to health care companies that do business with the federal government, they will cover the vast majority of insurers and medical providers. These entities also may not discriminate in employment based on these criteria. \nThe Affordable Care Act prohibits health insurance companies and medical providers from discriminating against patients based on sex. Prior to publishing a draft version of the regulation in September, the administration contended protections for transgender people were inherent in the ACA's statutory language. But the administration took explicit action at the urging of advocates for transgender people.\nWhat the regulations don't do is require health insurance companies to cover any specific treatments or procedures, including gender confirmation surgery. But the rules mandate that insurers cover a service for a transgender person when they cover it for any other patient. For example, if a policy pays for women to receive hormone therapy during menopause, it also must pay for a transgender person to get the same treatment as part of transition.\nSimilarly, the regulation requires insurers and health care providers to allow access to medical care irrespective of a transgender person's identity or gender assigned at birth. For instance, female-to-male transgender individuals can't be refused a medically necessary pelvic exam. \nThe regulation does not include a new exemption for religious reasons, but doesn't undo preexisting exemptions, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\nIn addition to the new protections based on sex, the regulation strengthens anti-discrimination guarantees for people with disabilities, and requires insurers and health care providers to make reasonable accommodations for patients with limited English proficiency."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.98", "GPT Reasoning: The article reports on a policy/regulatory action expanding transgender protections in health care under the Affordable Care Act, focusing on legal and civil-rights developments rather than scientific studies or research findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_75"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "639.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Mr. Trump, stand with Israel: The Western Wall is Jewish"]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Published May 20, 2017 \n \nOn the eve of President Trump\u2019s first overseas trip, an unfortunate dispute has emerged over the question, \u201cwhose wall is it?\u201d But who is the rightful owner of the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem should be indisputable. It is, after all, the last remaining piece of the Jewish Temple compound, destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 CE, and thus the primary destination for Jews in Israel and around the world to gather for prayer to this day.\nThankfully, one member of Trump\u2019s cabinet, U.S. ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, is clear on the matter. \u201cI believe the Western Wall is part of Israel and I think that that is how we\u2019ve always seen it and that\u2019s how we should pursue it,\u201d Haley said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN). \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought the Western Wall was part of Israel.\u201d\nHaley has been indefatigable in defending Israel at the UN, rigorously pressing other UN member states to end their longstanding hostility toward Israel on a range of issues, including the status of Jerusalem, Israel\u2019s capital.\nSuprisingly, however, one U.S. diplomat in the president\u2019s advance team told his Israeli counterparts that the Western Wall \"is not yours,\" that it is in the West Bank. Follow-up remarks by Press Secretary Spicer and National Security Advisor McMaster did not offer the clarity needed, certainly falling short of Haley\u2019s direct statement.\nDenying any Jewish connection to Jerusalem has been a Palestinian tactic, supported by the wider Arab and Muslim worlds, for decades. UNESCO member states have shamefully accepted the con and joined in Palestinian historical revisionism. Last October, UNESCO member states passed two resolutions referring to the Temple Mount, Judaism's holiest site, only by its Muslim name, Al-Aqsa Mosque/Al-Haram Al-Sharif, ignoring any Jewish, as well as Christian, connection to this site.\nWhile another resolution was adopted earlier this month with less support than before, it mostly repeated the same assertions regarding Jerusalem, Israel\u2019s capital city, and holy sites in Jerusalem and the West Bank. The U.S. opposed those measures, which makes the sudden vagueness on the Western Wall somewhat odd.\nJudaism -- and its centrality to Jewish identity, worship, and history -- predates Islam by millennia, and Christianity, with its linkage to Biblical sites in Jerusalem, predates Islam by centuries. The only time adherents of all three religions have enjoyed complete freedom of worship in Jerusalem has been under Israeli administration.\nWhenever Israelis and Palestinians have negotiated peace, going back to Camp David in 2000, there were discussions about sharing sovereignty over Jerusalem. But years of Palestinian violence and Palestinian Authority refusal to engage in bilateral talks raised and reinforced doubts about the possibility of agreeing on the final status of Jerusalem, and the topic was left on the back burner.\nThat President Trump will be the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Western Wall, assuming it happens, is profoundly significant. He should accept Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s offer to join him and his family at Judaism\u2019s holiest site. That would provide a powerful visual statement of U.S. recognition that Jerusalem is central to the Jewish people, and therefore should be recognized as Israel\u2019s capital.\nAs Ambassador Haley told CBN, \u201cObviously I believe that the capital should be in Jerusalem and the embassy should be moved to Jerusalem. All their government is in Jerusalem. So much of what goes on is in Jerusalem and, I think, we have to see that for what it is.\"\nDuring his visit, President Trump should make clear, consistent with his efforts to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace, that he will fulfill his promise and begin the process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\nKenneth Bandler is the American Jewish Committee's director of media relations."]}}}], [{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "GPT Analysis", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["GPT Confidence: 0.97", "GPT Reasoning: The article is a political/opinion piece about the status of the Western Wall, U.S. diplomacy, and historical claims \u2014 it does not report on scientific research, studies, or academic findings."]}}}, {"type": "multi_row_select", "content": {"rowLabels": ["Your Assessment"], "questions": [{"label": "Do you agree with GPT classification?", "id": {"1": "agreement_decision"}, "options": [{"label": "Yes", "value": "yes", "color": "success"}, {"label": "No", "value": "no", "color": "danger"}]}], "rows": [{"text": ["GPT classified this as: non-scientific"], "id": {"0": "agree_non_science_to_non_scientific_76"}}]}}]]}}, {"tabName": "4698.txt", "block": {"type": "column", "content": [[{"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": false, "title": {"text": "Article Title", "size": 4}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Hedge Fund  "]}}}, {"type": "text", "content": {"scrollable": true, "title": {"text": "Article Content", "size": 5}, "body": {"is_table": false, "text": ["Seeks to Sway  \nNew York Times\nHarbinger Also Targets Media General Board Amid Holder Discontent\n Updated Jan. 28, 2008 12:01 a.m. ET \n \nTwo media companies hope a hedge fund called Harbinger isn't, as its name might suggest, a sign of things to come.\nHarbinger Capital Partners Funds, a low-profile hedge fund managing $18 billion, nominated four candidates Friday for election to the board of New York Times Co.
