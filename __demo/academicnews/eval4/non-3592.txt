Although the Tampa Bay Buccaneers haven’t made any changes to the team’s coaching staff after the Bucs finished 5-11 in one of the most disappointing seasons they’ve had in years, general manager Jason Licht is still fully confident in his team and the future of the franchise.
Licht made that evident during a recent interview with ESPN’s Jenna Laine, where he confirmed that the Bucs plan on having a great free agency and upcoming draft which they’re hoping results in a much-needed comeback and better 2018 campaign which hopefully ends in a trip to the playoffs.
“I truly believe that this organization is on the verge of great things. I truly believe that,” Licht said. “We are working very hard right now to make some changes — there will be additions obviously, there will be subtractions on this team — but we will deliver the type of team that this town will be proud to support. We’re remaining positive. We’re very positive and looking forward to next year. It can’t start soon enough for me.”
The Bucs had an incredible offseason last year but unfortunately weren’t able to live up to the “Hard Knocks” hype and very high expectations. However, Licht and Co. have promised to do everything in their power to change that once and for all when fall rolls around and the Bucs take the field in their quest to a long-awaited playoff berth.
