Dr. Lukasz R. Niec was five years old when his parents fled Poland with their two children in 1979, his sister says. 
Now he's a respected doctor in Michigan, with a family of his own. He was enjoying a day off at his lakeside home near Kalamazoo last Tuesday when US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took him away in handcuffs.
Now, his family fears he faces deportation to a country he's never known.
"He doesn't even speak Polish," his sister, Iwona Niec-Villaire, told CNN affiliate WOOD. "He doesn't know anyone, he wouldn't know where to go." Niec received a temporary green card and later became a lawful permanent resident, the Washington Post reported.
Niec's detention stems from two misdemeanor convictions from his teenage years, one for destruction of property less than $100 and receiving and concealing stolen goods, WOOD reported.

According to his notice to appear from the Department of Homeland Security, convictions for such crimes involving "moral turpitude" made him eligible for removal, according to the Washington Post. 
When CNN contacted ICE to confirm his status and the reason for his detention, an automated message said the office was closed because of the government shutdown.
