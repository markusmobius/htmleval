Eco-friendly – As well as providing hope for a better future for underprivileged Ugandan youth, Byaruhanga also hopes the sustainable shoes will help protect the environment by repurposing "trash" like old tires. He says that Pamoja's profits from the shoe line are shared with the children who make them and thus help them support themselves, as well as learning a life skill.
