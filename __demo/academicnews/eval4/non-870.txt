TV Reporter Whose Girlfriend Was Killed In On-Air Shooting Quits
Southwest Virginia's Chris Hurst said he plans to enter politics.
A year and a half after a gunman killed his girlfriend and a cameraman during a live television broadcast, TV reporter Chris Hurst has decided it’s time to step back.
The co-anchor of Roanoke, Virginia’s, WDBJ-TV’s 6 p.m. news gave his last broadcast on Thursday, and said he intends to run for public office.
“My life changed dramatically on Aug. 26, 2015, when Alison Parker and Adam Ward were killed while reporting a story live on this station,” Hurst told viewers. “It was forever altered because, as you know, Alison was more than just my colleague. We were in love and planning our future together.”

Chris Hurst greets Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.) during a 2015 rally to demand Congress take action on gun control legislation.

“In one moment my life, my direction, and my mission changed forever,” Hurst added.
Police identified the gunman as a disgruntled former WDBJ reporter. He was found hours later with a self-inflicted fatal gunshot wound.

Hurst didn’t shy away from sharing his grief on air. His pain was WDBJ’s pain, noted The Roanoke Times.
Hurst hasn’t disclosed what office he’s considering seeking, the newspaper reported.
“Because of you, this community, and your love and support, I have been able to face each day with the hope that it does get better,” Hurst said in his last broadcast. “You held my hand as I walked through the wilderness, and I’m connected more to humanity than I ever thought possible.”
“For that, I thank you.”
