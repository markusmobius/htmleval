NFL Lineman Destroys A Bell While Celebrating End Of Chemotherapy
"This bell just like cancer never stood a chance."

Houston Texans offensive lineman David Quessenberry (77), who was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, rang the bell with style to celebrate the end of his chemotherapy treatment this week.

Houston Texans offensive lineman David Quessenberry has yet to block NFL defenders while battling Non-Hodgkins lymphoma for the past three years.
But this week he took out a hospital bell.
In an Instagram he posted Thursday, Quessenberry, listed at 6-foot-5 and 306 pounds, performed the ritual of ringing a bell to celebrate the end of his chemotherapy treatment. And he broke the bell right off. 
The 26-year-old used the light moment to write a serious message about how cancer shouldn’t get credit for bringing out the good in people.
“This bell just like cancer never stood a chance,” he concluded in a postscript.

The Texans drafted Quessenberry out of San Jose State in 2013. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2014 after missing his rookie season because of an injury, the Houston Chronicle noted.
He’s on the Texans’ active/non-football illness list, per Bleacher Report.
“If there is anybody that can come back and play,” Texans coach Bill O’Brien told ESPN in June, “it’s David Quessenberry.”
