Kim Kardashian Says Connection To Baby Girl 'Came Instantly'
Kardashian, 37, experienced difficulties, including preeclampsia and placenta accreta, while pregnant with her first two children, North, 4, and Saint, 2. She said her doctors warned her it wouldn’t be safe to carry a third child. 
The woman who carried the child has remained out of the public eye ― and even off the guest list for the baby shower. But Kardashian said she has nothing but love for her gestational carrier, which she said is the preferred term for a woman carrying a baby she isn’t related to.
“Having a gestational carrier is definitely different, but anyone who says or thinks it’s the easy way out is completely wrong,” she wrote. “People assume it’s better because you don’t have to deal with the physical changes, pain or complications with delivery, but for me it was so hard to not carry my own child, especially after I carried North and Saint.” 
Kardashian and West were both in the delivery room when their new daughter was born, according to E! News, and the new mom had the first skin-to-skin contact with the baby.
