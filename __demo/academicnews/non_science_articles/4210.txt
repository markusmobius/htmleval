Card 10 of 11
 An original song is supposed to be important to the film
 The award for Original Song (and original score) is just what it sounds like — music written specifically for a film, rather than for something else. For instance, Jennifer Lawrence's performance of "The Hanging Tree" from the third Hunger Games movie was ineligible, because its lyrics were written by Suzanne Collins for the Hunger Games book series. The music was original, but that's not enough.
 Original songs must also be "important" to the film they appear in. They must be heard within the movie itself, or as the first song during the closing credits. And that "important" clause often means that songs by prominent artists are nevertheless snubbed, because they don't play during a major montage or musical number within the film. Indeed, the recent trend in the category has been to move away from songs that play over the closing credits. (That said, most of the 2016 nominees were either opening credits songs or the first song that played over the closing credits.)
