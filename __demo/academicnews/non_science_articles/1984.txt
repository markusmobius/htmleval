Porsche’s Baby Turns 16; Seeks a Bigger Allowance

PORSCHE doesn’t like to be rushed. But while it took the company’s lab-coated obsessives 16 years to fully redesign the Boxster, the two-seat convertible has steadily evolved into one of the world’s best sports cars.
Flaunting retro-Spyder curves, the Boxster made a splash for 1997 as a more affordable midengine counterpart to Porsche’s revered 911. It’s hard to imagine now, with Porsche cranking out respectable production volumes and sizable profits with the Cayenne S.U.V. and Panamera sedan, but before the Boxster the company had devolved into a one-trick pony, troubled by quality issues and inefficiency. The 911, with only about 15,000 annual sales worldwide, wasn’t enough to keep Porsche afloat.
After dropping plans for a high-price sedan, Porsche bet the farm on the Boxster. But to have any chance at making money on a $40,000 sports car, Porsche had to hire former Toyota engineers — again, almost unfathomable — to tear down, revamp and modernize the entire company.
The efficiency expert James P. Womack wrote in Autoweek magazine, “Porsche wouldn’t be around if they hadn’t stared into the abyss and eaten a lot of crow.” He added, “To make any money on the car, the old Porsche would have had to sell it for $80,000.”
Or, 16 years later, for $88,720 — the sticker price of my 2013 Porsche Boxster S test car, larded like a veal chop with $27,000 in options. (At Porsche, the more things change... .) And that was for a model with a 6-speed manual transmission; adding the brilliant PDK 7-speed automated gearbox would have kicked the price to $91,920.
So much for the “affordable” Porsche. But despite some price inflation, the new Boxster starts at a more reasonable level: the base version is $50,450 and the powerful Boxster S starts at $61,850. Still, the perception that if you can afford a Boxster, you may as well buy a 911 doesn’t hold up to scrutiny: the most basic 911 Cabriolet starts around $95,000 and rises rapidly. What’s more, as the Boxster has grown from a 201-horsepower, bare-bones roadster into a modern, 315-horse marvel, it continues to keep pace with the 911’s advances.
The Boxster has sometimes been characterized as a more feminine sports car, and it has been popular among Hollywood stylists and Miami housewives. Porsche acknowledges giving the new version a mild testosterone injection. But whichever sex you credit, the new model is a rare beauty, filled with fine details that accentuate its 1950s-style curves. The doors are deeply scalloped, and the base of the windshield has moved forward nearly four inches.
What is manlier than 20-inch wheels? The Boxster’s optional Classic Carrera alloys — $2,730 extra on the S, plus $185 for wheel caps with the Porsche crest — were shod with milewide Pirelli tires that seemed suitable for a Dodge Viper.
Porsche says the car’s torsional rigidity, the topless body’s resistance to flexing, has increased 40 percent. The wheelbase is 2.4 inches longer, with a lower center of gravity and a wider “track” between the opposing wheels.
Even with many new features, 55 pounds have been trimmed from the base Boxster and 77 from the S. Curb weights range from 2,888 to 2,976 pounds. That’s 300 to 400 pounds less than the Porsche’s main rivals, the BMW Z4 35i and Mercedes SLK350.
A simpler roof design eliminates the metal tonneau cover that used to hide the folded fabric top, saving 26 pounds. Unlike the heavier BMW and Mercedes folding hardtops, the stowed top robs no cargo space — with the engine in the center, behind the seats, the Boxster has trunks front and rear — and opens or closes in just nine seconds. That top also operates at speeds below 32 miles per hour, a convenient feature I tested while gliding across the Manhattan Bridge.
As with the latest 911 and Cayenne, the interior of the Boxster has become legitimately rich, and — by Porsche standards, anyway — more user-friendly. My silver car featured a knockout full-leather Carrera Red interior that looked like a valentine from Stuttgart.
The cabin integrates Porsche’s new banked center console and an optional touch-screen infotainment system. (There goes $3,860.) That package adds a nifty color screen next to the huge analog tachometer, directly in the driver’s view, to display maps, audio and other information.

The base Boxster gets a smaller but stronger engine, a 2.7-liter direct-injection boxer 6 (down from 2.9 liters) with 265 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque. The big-boy S keeps its 3.4-liter 6, but it has gained five more horsepower, to 315, and produces 266 pound-feet of torque.
The Boxster forgoes the new 7-speed manual transmission of the 911, but you won’t miss the extra gear. The 6-speed’s precise handshake is as good as it gets on any automobile.
Perhaps because I tested the Boxster right after a Camaro ZL1, with a supercharged, 580-horsepower V-8, the Porsche felt a bit power-shy at first. But when you take full advantage of the magnificent Porsche powertrains, these cars are seriously quick. Porsche conservatively cites a 4.5-second scamper from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in the S model with the PDK gearbox, and a 173 m.p.h. top speed. That time is virtually equal to that of a Mustang Boss 302, which requires a 5-liter V-8 and 129 additional horses to do it.
In modern fashion, the manual-shift Boxsters are a tad slower, including the S’s 4.8-second run to 60 m.p.h.
As on the 911, owners can order every flavor of alphabet soup. There is, for instance, P.A.S.M., for Porsche Active Suspension Management, and P.T.V., for Porsche Torque Vectoring, which can speed up the outside rear wheel to slingshot the Boxster through corners.
The $1,850 Sport Chrono package features what must be the prettiest yet least-used feature in automobiles, a chronometer that can clock lap times. The reason to order Sport Chrono is that it comes with performance enhancements: its Sport and Sport Plus console buttons give the suspension, throttle and stability control a kick in the pants, and there is a racetrack-ready automated launch control feature on PDK-equipped versions.
The package now includes active transmission mounts, filled with magnetically charged fluid. The mounts stay soft at lower engine speeds to quell noise and vibration, then turn near-solid to keep the transmission from twisting when you hammer the throttle, sending more power to the wheels.
Combine that unbeatable midengine layout, the latest handling gizmos and enormous wheels and tires, and the Boxster becomes one of those “Now what?” cars: you wonder what speed it would take to produce the mildest rubber squeal on public roads. The Porsche’s pure, life-affirming handling continues to outstrip not just European rivals, but also the best versions of the Corvette, Mustang and Camaro.
If there is one point of contention, it is the car’s new electric-assisted steering.
Like every other company desperate to increase gas mileage, Porsche is replacing traditional hydraulic steering with electric-assisted units. Describing the difference in feel between hydraulic and electric steering isn’t easy. But traditionally, steering a Porsche was like shutting your eyes and running your hands over a face — every crease, stubble and dip comes through your fingertips, the image of the road becoming clear.
The Boxster’s electric steering delivers more muted sensations. But we’d better get used to it, because these systems are here to stay; not just for economy, but because electric steering can be linked with stability controls and other performance and safety systems.
And enthusiasts needn’t fear. The Boxster still carves a path with ultimate precision and more control than ever. Porsche’s electric unit, with a feedback sensor not found in most competitors, still feels more natural than others.
The mileage rating is notable, too, peaking at 22 miles per gallon in town and 32 on the highway for the base car with the PDK transmission, and 21/30 m.p.g. for the automatic-shifting S.
If only the price were more, well, 1997. Today, the Boxster has competition for the title of most affordable Porsche: the $49,825 Cayenne V-6. That nearly 2.5-ton family-loving Porsche is fun by S.U.V. standards, but it’s not an open-air two-seater. In other words, unlike the Boxster, it’s not one of the world’s most brilliant sports cars.
