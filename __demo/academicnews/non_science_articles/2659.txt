BALTIMORE (AP) — Joe Sherburne scored 18 points, including a dagger of a 3-pointer from the corner to blunt a comeback and Maryland-Baltimore County defeated Binghamton 69-57 Wednesday night.
Sherburne made 7 of 11 shots, including 4 of 6 from deep, had four assists, two steals and a blocked shot for UMBC (14-8, 5-2 America East Conference), which rebounded from a 44-point loss at Albany. The Retrievers have won four of their last five and retain sole possession of second place in conference behind Vermont.
Binghamton (10-12, 1-6) trailed by 18 at halftime, but scrapped back with a 23-8 run and twice came as close as five points with less than five minutes to play. Everson Davis 3-pointer pulled the Bearcats to 59-54 before Sherburne stepped up.
He fed Jourdan Grant for a 3-pointer, then stole the ball from Willie Rodriquez and dished to K.J. Maura for a jump shot. Sherburne ended the 8-0 run with the corner 3 that put UMBC up 67-54 with 1:31 to play.
Jairus Lyles added 17 points and Grant 10 for UMBC, which shot 51 percent (26 of 51).
Davis led the Bearcats with 14 points and Tyler Stewart scored 13.
