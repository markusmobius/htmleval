Letter to the editor: 
The men of American football deserve our thanks and support. By kneeling, they are honoring the flag and the men and women who have sacrificed their lives for our country. The players’ statement is clear. They respect America, but our country is falling short in fulfilling the great values of democracy it espouses. Their kneeling is not a rejection of America, it is a plea for our nation to be all that we embrace. It is a measure of the players’ courage to take a unified stand against human injustice in our country.
Unified dissent is one of the cornerstones of a democracy. It is a principle that has been practiced for 802 years, since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. In that year, a group of rebellious and dissenting barons in England forced King John to sign their brilliant document.
The Magna Carta has become a foundation for human liberty and justice around the world, and in the United States particularly. We must acknowledge that it was the positive product of unified dissent by courageous men.
As this phenomenon for social justice gains momentum, football will not only continue to be America’s foremost sport, it will also become an acknowledged leader for civil justice. Now that will truly be an American legacy.
