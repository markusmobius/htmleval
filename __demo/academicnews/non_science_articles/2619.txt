Slapped down by the prime minister, duffed up by the chancellor and given both barrels by the home secretary, Boris Johnson’s pre-leaked intervention into the NHS funding debate did not go down well with his colleagues. But – amplified by Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs – has it helped buff up his populist credentials? And as the backroom murmurs about who will succeed Theresa May continue to grow, is the Conservative party struggling to articulate new ideas to counter the surge in Corbynism?
Heather Stewart hears from the Conservative MP George Freeman, the chair of the party’s policy forum. We also hear from the Guardian’s joint political editor Anushka Asthana, the columnist Matthew d’Ancona, Conservative Home’s Mark Wallace and the Conservative Woman editor Laura Perrins.
Also this week: with the centre of economic gravity shifting ever closer to China, will the distinction between Europe and Asia begin to erode? We hear from Bruno Maçães about his new book The Dawn of Eurasia.
