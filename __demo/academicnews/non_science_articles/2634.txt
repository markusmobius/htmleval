The rapper told the Cavaliers star that he’s one of the most inspirational people he knows and that he’s going to go to work in the studio to try to make a song that fits James’ milestone. Drake also acted like he dropped a bottle of expensive wine that was meant for James as a goofy but very Drake way to end the video.
“LeBron, I’m honored to be part of yet another historic night. 30,000 career points, it’s incredible. It seems like every time we look up you’re setting another milestone or breaking another record. I always tell you you’re one of the most inspirational people in my life. I’m honored to call you a brother. Every time you do something like this, I always try to get in the studio and make the song that will go with the moment, so I’m excited to go to work tonight.”
