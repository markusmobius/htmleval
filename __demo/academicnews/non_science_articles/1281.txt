Maine Gov. Paul LePage Considering Senate Run In 2018
"I'm thinking about it very strongly."

Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) is considering a Senate run in 2018.

Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) said Tuesday he may run for Senate in 2018, which would pit him against Sen. Angus King (I-Maine). 
"I'm thinking about it very strongly," LePage told conservative radio host Howie Carr. 
In January, LePage also told Carr that he was looking at a Senate run, although the following day, he said he was joking. 
LePage has been a controversial governor known for making outlandish statements -- like joking that he wanted to shoot a newspaper cartoonist and comparing the IRS to the Gestapo. He won re-election in 2014, despite abysmal approval ratings. 
Carr tweeted out a photo with LePage Tuesday, showing the governor wearing a hat with Donald Trump's presidential slogan on it. LePage, however, has endorsed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) for president, and Carr had to tweet a clarification that LePage hadn't switched allegiances.

Just a little fun with a good hat. LePage says he's still backing Gov. Chris Christie. "We need a governor." #mepolitics

LePage, who has never shied away from making eyebrow-raising comments about his critics, said Trump needs to knock off his feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly.
"You’ve got to let this stuff go and move on," LePage said. "Move on to the issues."
