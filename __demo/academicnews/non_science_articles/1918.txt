BAGHDAD — The top American military officer, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., arrived here on Tuesday to take stock of the campaign against the Islamic State, as Iraq and the American-led coalition are trying to regain the initiative and territory from the militants.
It was the first overseas trip for General Dunford since he took over this month as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
General Dunford conferred with Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who last month became the commander of the international coalition’s effort in Iraq and Syria. He also met with Khaled al-Obeidi, Iraq’s defense minister, and Haider al-Abadi, Iraq’s prime minister.
The American-led coalition is putting pressure on the militants on several fronts. Backed by American air power, Iraqi forces are on the outskirts of Ramadi, which was taken by the militants in May. Iraqi forces and Shiite militias captured the Baiji oil refinery, north of Baghdad, on Friday and are trying to expand the territory under their control there. On Tuesday, the Iraqi military said it had secured the nearby town of Baiji after days of fighting.

Clashes are also taking place in the Sinjar region, in northwest Iraq, between Kurdish forces and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. And the American military said last week that it had parachuted ammunition to Syrian Arab fighters in northeast Syria, with a goal of having the Arab fighters join a larger body of Kurdish forces advancing toward Raqqa, the Islamic State’s capital in Syria.

“We are trying to fight him throughout the depth and breadth of the battlefield in Iraq and Syria,” General MacFarland said in an interview Sunday, referring to fighters for the Islamic State.
Baghdad was the second stop in Iraq for General Dunford, who commanded a Marine Corps regiment during the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein.
On Tuesday morning, he arrived in Erbil, where he met with President Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdish regional government, and other senior Kurdish officials.
The United States carried out airstrikes in 2014 to prevent the Islamic State from moving on Erbil after Mosul was captured by the militants in June of that year. It is supporting Kurdish pesh merga fighters with advisers and airstrikes. Several hundred troops from Italy, Norway, Britain, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Hungary are also training Kurdish forces.
General Dunford arrived here after talks in Israel and Jordan.
