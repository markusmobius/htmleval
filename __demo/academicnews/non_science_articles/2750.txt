 USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes looks at the three biggest story lines heading into Week 8. 

Corrections & clarifications: An earlier headline on this story misidentified the criminal charges against J.J. Worton.
The NFL has suspended a free agent receiver who received probation for a conviction on three assault and battery charges, stemming from accusations in January he indecently touched two women at a bar and punched a man who confronted him.
J.J. Worton, a former University of Central Florida star who was cut from the New England Patriots’ practice squad soon after his January arrest, was suspended for six weeks effective Oct. 10, the league told teams on the internal transaction wire last week.

Worton’s suspension is set to be lifted Nov. 22. The six-week suspension matches the guideline for a first offense involving assault, battery, sexual assault and other offenses under the personal conduct policy the NFL strengthened after a series of controversies in 2014.
Worton, 24, was found guilty April 1 on the three charges, according to the Wrentham (Mass.) District Court Clerk’s Office. His probation runs through March 31, 2017.
He had a second stint with this offseason the Los Angeles Rams, but was cut June 27 and has been out of the league since.
