 Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri: A wise, dark comedy about a broken world
 In September, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri won the prestigious People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival — considered a strong predictor for a good performance during Oscar season. The film bears a strong resemblance to a Flannery O’Connor story in its dark and even startling humor and scathing, grace-filled take on human nature.
 It’s actually written and directed by In Bruges’ Martin McDonagh (who shares O’Connor’s Catholicism-influenced storytelling bent) and stars Frances McDormand as a bereaved mother in small-town Missouri who has finally had it with the unfairness of a world full of ineffective justice systems, racists, hypocrites, and men who do bad things and get away with them. With terrific performances from McDormand and co-stars Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson, it's often funny but always poignant.
 "McDonagh’s latest work is simply exceptional; a film so rich with narrative fluidity, profane laughs, standout performances and complex character studies that its tremendous emotional hits — often arriving when you least expect them — might just leave you agog." Rory O'Connor, Film Stage
