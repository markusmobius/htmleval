Not everyone finds themselves jumping in the air on exam results day for an enthusiastic newspaper photographer. While some students receive the grades they want, others will be more than disappointed.
A levels and GCSEs are great markers in our lives, with the former signalling the end of thirteen years of school education. There is a lot to celebrate. But for those of us who don’t make the grades it can be hard to see a way forward.
Grades fell slightly last year, but does this mean that more people will fail to go on to have fulfilling lives? No, it doesn’t. I got an E in textiles. But it all worked out okay in the end.
Did you receive less than desirable GCSE or A Level results? What happened next? We want to hear your positive stories for a feature on the site.
