Author Michael Wolff blames himself for Steve Bannon's woes. 
Bannon stepped down from his position as the executive chairman of Breitbart News Tuesday amid an uproar over remarks he was quoted as making in Wolff's new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, that were critical of President Trump's family. 
A day after Bannon's Breitbart exit, Wolff told the panel on ABC's The View that, "It's certainly not something I feel good about." 
Wolff said Bannon grew frustrated after he began working in the White House and saw that "Trumpism and Donald Trump were at a significant distance from each other."
"I think Steve wrestled with that in very, very tough ways," Wolff said. "And, ultimately, I was the recipient of his enormous frustration."

 I 'probably' called Trump an 'idiot' sarcastically, ex-advisor admits 
"So you're the reason he's out?" asked View host Joy Behar. 
"I'm the reason he's out," Wolff said. 
In the book, Bannon is quoted as calling Donald Trump Jr.'s 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer "treasonous." Wolff also quotes him calling Ivanka Trump "dumb as a brick." 
When those quotes became public, President Trump said Bannon had "lost his mind" and began referring to his former chief strategist as "Sloppy Steve."
