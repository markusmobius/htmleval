Corrections and clarifications: The following post has been updated because an earlier version misstated when the photo of JoJo Fletcher was taken.
After a heartbreaking blow from Season 20's The Bachelor Ben Higgins, JoJo Fletcher has reopened her heart for another shot at love – but this time, as the leading lady.
With a fresh new face free of Ben-inflicted tears, JoJo is ready to find herself a husband that can offer her more than just "I love you's."

She's been living the dream with a group of men, that according to show runner Mike Fleiss, has been gaga for JoJo.

Just in case you were wondering how she possibly got over the picture-perfect former bachelor, she gave us a nice, big hint on her Instagram.

So, mark your calendars for May 23 and let the tears, relationships, first impressions, and drama-filled rejections begin! (And this time around, you best believe that JoJo Fletcher is going in with the right mentality.)
