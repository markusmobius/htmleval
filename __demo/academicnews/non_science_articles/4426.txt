 BAGHDAD, Dec. 8 -- A suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck attacked a police station north of Baghdad on Saturday, the latest in a week of bombings that have left 80 people dead. 
 The truck was allowed through the main gate of the complex in the town of Baiji after the driver told guards he was delivering sand to a construction site inside. The driver detonated his payload when two policemen approached him as he tried to enter a parking lot, police said. 
 The blast, which damaged nearby homes and sent shards of glass flying, killed eight people and wounded 16, police said. 
 Baiji, about 150 miles north of Baghdad, houses northern Iraq's largest oil refinery and serves as a key transfer point for crude oil being exported out of the country. 
 Violence has been unrelenting in northern Iraq as insurgents combat a U.S.-Iraqi security crackdown and a groundswell of public opinion that has turned Sunni tribal leaders against the terrorist network. 
 U.S. troops killed 12 suspected al-Qaeda in Iraq members and detained 13 in a series of raids in central and northern Iraq, including one that ended with an airstrike on a palm grove where gunmen had taken up position outside Yusufiyah, near Baghdad, the U.S. military said.
