After the Lynx’s loss in the 2016 WNBA finals, Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve called Sylvia Fowles into her office and told her things would be different in the 2017 season. The offense would change, this time to run more through the center, who would have to step up.
It worked: Fowles put up incredible regular season numbers, 18.9 points per game, 10.4 rebounds and two blocks. Her efficiency rating, per Basketball Ratings, was 30.9 — up nearly seven points from last season.
Now Fowles and the Lynx are likely heading on a collision course with the Sparks to repeat 2016’s final match-up. After accepting her award on Thursday, Fowles scored 25 points to help her team beat the Mystics to put Washington in an 0-2 hole.
 "A proud moment."

“It’s incredibly gratifying,” Reeve told the Star-Tribune. “She’s an incredibly unselfish person at heart. We had to kind of ask her to be selfish at times. To remain aggressive. She’s always known she had it in her. And that’s why she came here, to get to this place.”
