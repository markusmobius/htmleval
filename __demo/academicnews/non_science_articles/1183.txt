These Ugly Shorts May Actually Improve Your Sex Life (Really)
... but we have our doubts.
How’s this for a quandary: There is a new brand of shorts coming to market that may help improve a man’s sexual performance.
However, even if they work, they are ugly enough that they may make some potential partners decide against having sex with you.
The boner-building biker-style shorts are the creation of VylyV (vill-live), a start-up that plans to raise funds soon via Kickstarter.
The shorts supposedly work by recording your movements throughout the day and sending that info to an app that designs workout plans and guidelines to improve your pelvic floor muscles doing butt-squeezing kegel exercises.
And, yes, men can benefit from doing kegels, too. 
Strengthening those muscles improves blood flow to the sex organs, according to the Mayo Clinic.
Not sure what that means? The makers of the product hope you’ll get the hint from this subtle and tasteful shot of a fizzy soda bottle.
