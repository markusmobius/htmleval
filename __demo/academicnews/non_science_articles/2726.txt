WASHINGTON — Chelsea Manning, the former Army private imprisoned for leaking classified government documents, confirmed Sunday that she is running for the U.S. Senate.
Manning, 30, tweeted “yup, we’re running for senate” with an attached campaign video. She sent a second tweet seeking donations to her campaign.
Federal Election Commission documents show Manning of North Bethesda, Md., filed paperwork on Thursday to run as a Democrat, a move that would pit her against two-term Sen. Ben Cardin in the state's June primary. Cardin is Maryland's senior U.S. senator, and the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
yup, we're running for senate 😎🌈💕 #WeGotThishttps://t.co/ynFv6w32np

Manning, a transgender woman formerly known as Bradley Manning, was convicted by court-martial in 2013 of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks and sentenced to 35 years in prison.
President Obama commuted her sentence, and Manning was released from military prison last year after serving seven years.
The Oklahoma native had planned to move to Maryland, where she has an aunt. She has been registered to vote at the apartment in North Bethesda since mid-August, according to the Maryland State Board of Elections.
Her recent move would not affect a Senate bid. To run for that office, a person must be at least 30, a U.S. citizen for nine years and an inhabitant of the state at election time, according to the Maryland State Board of Elections. A felony conviction does not appear to preclude a run.
