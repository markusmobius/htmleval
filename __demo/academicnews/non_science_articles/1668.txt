Trump meets with May at Davos, praises ‘great relationship’ with UK
State Senate leader slams Cuomo's payroll tax proposal
President Trump on Thursday praised the “great relationship” the United States has with Britain and pledged to Prime Minister Theresa May that his administration would always have her back.
“We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military,” Trump said during a meeting with May at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We have the same ideas, the same ideals, and there’s nothing that would happen to you that we won’t be there to fight for you.”
Trump, the first president to attend the annual gathering since President Clinton in 2000, tried to dispel the “false rumor” that he and May have a rocky relationship.
“We’re on the same wavelength I think in every respect,” he said. “The prime minister and myself have a really great relationship, although some people don’t necessarily believe that. But I can tell you I have tremendous respect for the prime minister and the job she’s doing, and I think the feeling is mutual.”
“We love your country,” he added.
For her part, May said the two long-time allies have a “special relationship.”
“We’re standing shoulder to shoulder because we’re facing challenges across the world and as you say we’re working together to defeat those challenges,” she said.
May was the first world leader to visit Trump in the White House after his inauguration and invited the president to England.
Earlier this month, Trump pulled out of attending the open of a new US Embassy in London, claiming that he didn’t want support a deal by the Obama administration to sell the old embassy for “peanuts” – calling it a “bad deal.”
President George W. Bush actually made the decision to move the embassy in 2008.
