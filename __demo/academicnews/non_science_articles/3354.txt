Taking a knee won't change police-community relations: Your Say
Perhaps the best way to kill the divisive flag debate is to stop playing the anthem. Go for a moment of silence instead.

I do not agree with athletes taking a knee during the national anthem. First, while I can appreciate that some Americans identify negatively with our flag, I just think that not standing is disrespectful. Second, and it’s a shame to say but, taking a knee isn’t going to change a thing when it comes to police-community relations or racism. Really, the only thing that kneeling has changed is Colin Kaepernick’s employment status.
But the bigger question is: Why do we play the national anthem at football games at all?
Being a “professional athlete” is a job like any other. Compensation to the players is exchanged for a service given to the fans. Pro athletes and coaches are always talking about stuff like knowing their job and getting the job done. Game days are surely a rush for the players. Stuff like practice, watching film and studying playbooks can be likened to the grind of a real nine-to-five.
If the NFL has to play the anthem before “work” every Sunday, why not play the anthem every time our police or fire professionals start a new shift? How about when a trauma surgeon walks into an emergency room to save the lives of shot-up concert goers? If anyone deserves a heartfelt rendition of the anthem it’s these folks, not some overindulged athlete whose personal experiences compel him to protest.
 So, what do you say we knock off the binary argument about respecting or not respecting the flag and just stop playing the anthem before games, period? Instead, maybe NFL commissioner Roger Goodell can host a moment of silence.
