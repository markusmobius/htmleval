Kim Kardashian Reportedly Wants More Kids After Baby Chicago
New York? London? Kansas City?
A week after welcoming her third child, Kim Kardashian is reportedly mulling over expanding her famous family again. 
The reality TV star and her husband Kanye West brought a baby girl named Chicago into the world via a surrogate on Jan. 15. The mom of three, who had tried to conceive naturally for years despite two high-risk pregnancies, opened up about how the connection to the new baby “came instantly.”
“Even before Chicago was born, Kim was talking about asking the surrogate to carry her next baby,” a source told People. 
“She’s so happy with the whole process and thrilled with the surrogate,” the source added. “Kanye was even bonding with the surrogate’s husband in the delivery room.”
