Chris Pratt misses when he was fat — and so does wife Anna Faris

Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story misrepresented the name of Stephen Colbert's show.
Before Chris Pratt was the svelte action star of Jurassic World and the forthcoming Passengers, he was Andy Dwyer, the buffoonish-yet-lovable character on Parks and Rec who couldn't run a lap around a track without getting winded.
Pratt stopped by The Late Show to chat about Passengers with Stephen Colbert, and right around their interview's 4:20 mark, the host revealed that he "kinda misses 'Fat Pratt.'"
"Do you miss him at all?" Colbert asked the actor.
 "Yes. Yeah, I do," Pratt responded. "My wife does too. She likes to cook, and I don't get to eat as much of her cooking as I used to."
Sorry, Anna Faris.
The actor may be in the six-pack phase of his career, but he revealed that "fat Pratt" will make his triumphant return someday. "He's not gone forever," he said, his face lighting up. "He's just on vacation for a couple years, but he's coming back."
And when that time comes, we'll welcome him back with open arms.
