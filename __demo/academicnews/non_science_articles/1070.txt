The New York Daily News' Ted Cruz Cover Doesn't Mince Words
Ouch.
Hey New York Daily News editors: Tell us how you really feel about Ted Cruz.
Splashed across Thursday's edition was the headline "Take The F U Train, Ted!" The cover referenced the fact that the Texas senator was booed at an event in the Bronx on Wednesday night.
"Ted Cruz has no business being in the Bronx," one protester said.

The Republican presidential hopeful made some enemies in the Empire State after chiding Donald Trump's "New York values" during an interview in January.
Trump hit back at Cruz during a debate later that week.
"When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York," he said. "We rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched. And everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers."
Trump campaigned off of Cruz's remarks this week too, telling Long Island voters that "I think you can forget about him."
It seems many New Yorkers already have -- Cruz is trailing both Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in recent polls.
