Arianna appeared on Keith Olbermann's "Countdown" Tuesday to discuss Obama's recent move to review federal regulations agencies and his assertion that deregulation will create jobs.
Olbermann asked Arianna if she thought the president's move was "political pandering, some sort of sincere idea for job growth, or something else?"
Arianna responded that it seems the president has one priority on his mind. "It shows that his primary, maybe his exclusive preoccupation right now, is reelection," she said. "Because there is no other explanation. Obviously he wants businesses to stop just giving to Republicans and start contributing once again to his reelection campaign as they did in 2008, especially Wall Street."
She continued that she believes Obama's effort to deregulate regulation agencies "just doesn't make any sense at all. We need to have a big debate on how to save American capitalism."
