An attorney for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev filed a motion Monday asking for a new trial for the 21-year-old convicted Boston Marathon bomber. 
The bare-bones document filed in U.S. District Court in Boston omits any details about on what grounds Tsarnaev will appeal, and acts as a placeholder for a more comprehensive motion to be filed later this summer.
"A new trial is required in the interests of justice and judgments notwithstanding the verdict are required as a matter of evidentiary insufficiency," lawyer Judy Clarke wrote. 
Looming court deadlines led Clarke to submit what's described in the paperwork as a "placeholder."
Tsarnaev was sentenced to death by a jury in May on six charges stemming from the April 15, 2013, bombing that killed three spectators and injured about 260 more people. 
Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed said it was not a significant move by the defense. 
"The defense wants to make sure it doesn’t waive its right to challenge any particular issues," said Medwed. "They’re exercising caution."
Calls and emails from The Huffington Post to Tsarnaev's defense team were not immediately answered.
