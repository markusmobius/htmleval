The foreign nationals were members of an investment team for a solar power project in Kafanchan district in Southern Kaduna, Kaduna State Police spokesman Mukhtar Aliyu told CNN. 
The four were abducted at 7 p.m. Tuesday, while traveling with police escorts from Kaduna city to Abuja. "The abductors ambushed them along with police escorts who traveled with them, two policemen were killed in the gun battle," he said.
The road connecting Abuja and Kaduna has long been targeted by kidnappers.
The US State Department warned last year against travel to Kaduna and seven other states in northern Nigeria due to frequent instances of robbery and abduction along the Kaduna-Abuja highway.
Kaduna is among nine states targeted by Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group based in northeast Nigeria, it said.
CNN's Bukola Adebayo contributed to this report.
