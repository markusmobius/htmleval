NBA All-Star mock draft: USA TODAY's selections
Channeling our inner captains LeBron James and Stephen Curry, USA TODAY Sports’ NBA desk took the liberty of mocking the All-Star draft ahead of Thursday’s team announcements.
Jeff Zillgitt, as James, had the No. 1 pick and opted for 2017 Finals MVP Kevin Durant. That ensured Sam Amick, as Curry, wouldn’t get to build an All-Star super-team out of the four Golden State Warriors that were selected.
With the second pick, Amick went with New Orleans center Anthony Davis. On and on they went, Zillgitt opting for pettiness and Amick opting for length. Not only did Zillgitt end up with James and Kyrie Irving on his squad, he also reunited Russell Westbrook and Durant. So much for team harmony.
Meanwhile, Amick stockpiled the likes of Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns and Kristaps Porzingis.
In response to Amick’s length, Zillgitt drafted DeMarcus Cousins as his enforcer. His explanation?
“Giannis is going to snap in two when DeMarcus Cousins fouls him,” he said. “I got DeMarcus. He’s going to take Anthony Davis out, too.”

Feeling confident in his squad’s length, Amick started to get cocky toward the end of the draft.
“I think I’m probably winning by 20 at this point,” he said. “I don’t know how you feel.”
The two traded picks, beginning with the starters and finishing with reserves. Here's how their two squads shook out. 
Zillgitt: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, DeMarcus Cousins, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Love, Bradley Beal, Kyle Lowry, LaMarcus Aldridge. 
Amick: Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Kristaps Porzingis, Damian Lillard, Karl-Anthony Towns, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Al Horford
