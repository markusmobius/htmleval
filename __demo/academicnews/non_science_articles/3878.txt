In an interview with Esquire, featherweight challenger Conor McGregor became the latest mixed martial artist to call out Floyd Mayweather, saying that he would make short work of the unbeaten champ. Very short work: less than 30 seconds.
“I look at him as a rookie in ten other areas. If you can box, what happens if I grab hold of your legs? If you put me face-to-face with Floyd Mayweather—pound-for-pound boxing’s best—if I fought Floyd, I would kill him in less than thirty seconds. It would take me less than thirty seconds to wrap around him like a boa constrictor and strangle him.”
He makes a totally valid point here. Mayweather not being a master of the ground-and-pound is a very reasonable assumption to make. I would also pay a lot of money to see this fight happen.
As for the way he said it, well, Conor McGregor is really chatty and pretty much known for making brazen claims at this point. He also tends to back it up. I’m still not calling him “The Irish Ali,” though. You can if you want.
