O'Connor, First Woman Supreme Court Justice, Resigns After 24 Years
WASHINGTON, July 1 ÂJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court, announced today that she is resigning, setting off what is expected to be a tumultuous fight over confirming her successor.
Justice O'Connor, 75, is widely viewed as the critical swing vote on abortion, affirmative action and other hot-button issues that have divided the court, and her departure is sure to ignite a passionate ideological battle throughout the summer.
Her departure, which had been the subject of rumors for weeks but was still a surprise, will give President Bush his first opportunity to name a justice to the Supreme Court. It is still not clear whether Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who is battling thyroid cancer and had been widely expected to resign, will step down this summer, giving Mr. Bush another seat to fill.
Mr. Bush scheduled a statement for later this morning in the White House Rose Garden.
In a letter sent this morning to the White House, Justice O'Connor said she would step down as soon as her successor was named.

ÂIt has been a great privilege, indeed, to have served as a member of the court for 24 terms. I will leave it with enormous respect for the integrity of the court and its role under our constitutional structure,Â she said in the three-sentence letter.
Her decision even took allies of the White House by surprise.
ÂAn O'Connor resignation was not one we took seriously,Â said C. Boyden Gray, a former White House counsel who founded the Committee for Justice, one of the key advocacy groups set to back whoever the president nominates. Mr. Gray received a text message during an interview with The New York Times at his Georgetown home shortly after 9:30 this morning informing him of Justice O'Connor's resignation.
