Dig site could rewrite history

An archaeological find at Lunt Meadows in Sefton, Merseyside, has unearthed evidence that Mesolithic man may have built settlements.
If proven, it could change the way historians think about how humans lived in the middle Stone Age period.
It was always thought that Mesolithic man was nomadic, yet this site presents the possibility that several families may have lived together in one place.
The discoveries have been dated back to the middle Stone Age (5,800BC) and reveal a floor, timber stakes which would have been part of a wall, as well as flints and other utensils.
