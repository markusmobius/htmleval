This is how Joe Scarborough reacted to video of the Washington Post's Wesley Lowery being arrested by police in Ferguson, MO:
"I will just say if I saw that video and my son was the one police arrested after that episode, I'd say, 'Joey, heres a clue. When the cops tell you for the thirtieth time, let's go, you know what that means, son? It means let's go. I'm sorry...I don't sit there and have a debate and film the police officer unless I want to get on TV and have people talk about me the next day."
This is how Lowery responded on CNN's "New Day":
"I would invite Joe Scarborough to come down to Ferguson and get out of 30 Rock where he's sipping his Starbucks smugly...I have little patience for talking heads. This is too important. This is a community in the United States of America where things are on fire. This community is on edge. There is so much happening here and instead of putting reporters on the ground we have people like Joe Scarborough running their mouth who have no idea what they're talking about."
