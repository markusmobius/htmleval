RIO DE JANEIRO — Tori Bowie won silver in the women’s 100 meters, her first Olympic medal.
 Bowie (10.83) finished between Jamaicans Elaine Thompson (10.71), who won her first Olympic medal, and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (10.86). Bowie's finish gives Team USA back-to-back silver medals in the event, following Carmelita Jeter's run in London in 2012.
 Fraser-Pryce had won the 100 at the previous two Olympic Games.
The event once again belonged to Jamaica, which extended its run of dominance in the 100-meter sprint to three Olympic Games.
 This marked the third Summer Games in a row in which Jamaicans have claimed at least two medals in the discipline.
