Arianna Discusses Sarah Palin's Stunning Hypocrisy (VIDEO)

Arianna appeared on "Countdown with Keith Olbermann" Friday and explained that Sarah Palin's refusal to call out Rush Limbaugh for his use of the word "retard" proves that she is afraid that offending the radio host and arbiter of the conservative movement could hurt her image. 
Earlier this week, Palin called for Rahm Emanuel to be fired after he used the same word. 
Arianna argued that Palin's decision to go after Emanuel, but not Limbaugh is all part of Palin's "cost-benefit analysis" operating procedure:
Arianna: Everything with her seems to be about this cost-benefit analysis, you know what is in her best interests as opposed to anything else. And that goes directly against the brand that she tried to build about her being authentic, being about her core values, keeping her baby eventhough it was a down syndrome baby. All these things... are really exposed here as nothing but a veneer. The hypocrisy is really stunning
