Arianna Huffington appeared on CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS" to discuss the fallout of the debt ceiling deal.
She said that President Obama "failed" at gaining independent support.
"If Obama thought that this was really his way of saying, 'I'm the grownup in the room, I'm going to compromise, go with me,' it's not working," she explained.
Discussing the deal's economic shortfalls, she said, "On purely economic terms, this is not working...you had basically a pretty reasonable consensus among the economists, this is not the right policy long term to control the deficit."
