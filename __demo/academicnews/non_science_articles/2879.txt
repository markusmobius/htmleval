On January 20, 2017, USA TODAY NETWORK will transport its readers to Washington, D.C. to experience the inauguration of Donald Trump through multi-platform virtual reality and 360-degree coverage.
The stream will include multiple VR camera angles positioned at the Capitol, the National Mall, and along the inaugural parade route for a fully immersive experience. The cameras are provided by Nikon, who is working exclusively with USA TODAY NETWORK using a customized KeyMission 360 camera that allows the NETWORK to livestream in 360-degrees via in-camera stitching.
This event will be the first livestream VR content produced by USA TODAY NETWORK on its ‘VRtually There’ show. Launched in October 2016 as a weekly VR show, ‘VRtually There’ has reached more than five million views on multiple platforms. USA TODAY NETWORK has been a leader in VR storytelling and continues to provide remarkable experiences for its audience as the premier news organization.
The livestream will be available in VR headsets via the USA TODAY channel in the YouTube app. The livestream will also be available in 360-degree format via the USA TODAY YouTube channel for desktop and mobile users.
USA TODAY NETWORK’s streaming coverage of the inauguration begins at approximately 9:30 am as invited VIPs take their seats and musical performances begin.
“USA TODAY NETWORK has been a pioneer in VR storytelling and we’re excited for the next iteration with the livestream of the presidential inauguration,” said Russ Torres, Vice President of Video Content. “We believe that VR offers a unique storytelling ability, and we will continue to provide our readers with the opportunity to experience events such as the inauguration like never before.”
