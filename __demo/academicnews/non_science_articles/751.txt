The One Thing Melinda Gates Does Every Day To Ease Stress
The power of meditation.
Philanthropist Melinda Gates' secret to maintaining her well-being is simple: Prioritize moments of quiet.
During an interview at the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Gates told HuffPost's Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani that she meditates every single day.
"The first thing I do in the morning is meditate," she said. "The last thing I do at night is try to get to bed before 10 o'clock so I can get up and meditate."
Gates, who represented the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Davos, Switzerland this week, has been championing meditation for years. She's been outspoken about how the practice keeps her grounded in the past -- and her foundation has helped fund mindfulness research.
It's no wonder Gates makes mindfulness a priority: Research shows the practice can help reduce stress, boost the immune system and improve cognitive functioning.
Other public figures like Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, Rush Communications CEO Russell Simmons and HuffPost president and editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington also swear by meditation as a way to help them stay calm amidst their busy schedules.
