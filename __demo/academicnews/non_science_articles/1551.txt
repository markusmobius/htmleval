U.S. Drone Crashes in Desert, Iraqi Military Says
Share
 A U.S. military drone crashed in the Iraqi desert and was found by a shepherd, officials in Baghdad said Tuesday after pictures of a downed device circulated on social media. 
 The drone was found near Samawa in the Muthana Province of south-western Iraq, according to General Yahya Al-Zubaidi, spokesman of the Joint Operation Command. 
 “I talked to U.S. advisers and they confirmed that they lost a drone two weeks ago.,” he said. “The shepherd called the police and a unit from the Samawa Police Directorate arrived at the location and they took it to the Al-Mamlaha police station." 
 Unverified pictures circulating on Twitter showed Iraqis posing for selfies in front of what appeared to be a crashed drone, but it wasn’t clear if the device was the same as the one lost by the U.S.
