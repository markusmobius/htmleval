Watch Gwen Stefani slay Drake's 'Hotline Bling' with Blake Shelton

Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story misspelled Gwen Stefani's name. 
The fates of the coaches from The Voice were written on the cards on Monday night's episode of The Tonight Show. Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, and Pharrell Williams all stepped up for Spin the Microphone, which seemed for some like host Jimmy Fallon's personal torture device.
Players took turns spinning the mic on a board with their names and selecting cards with songs written on them. And they could either sing the song or make another player belt out the tune.
While we wouldn't have turned our chairs for Adam's extremely lackluster Oops!... I Did It Again or Blake's version of the YMCA, we definitely would've hit our button for Gwen and Blake's version of Hotline Bling– though really only because of Gwen. Their awesome performance starts around the 8:30 mark.
