Texas State survives late 3-point attempt in 62-61 win
STATESBORO, Ga. (AP) — Nijal Pearson scored 22 points, Tre'Larenz Nottingham sank the winning free throw with 3.7 seconds showing on the clock and Texas State survived a desperation shot at the buzzer to defeat Georgia Southern 62-61 Thursday night, breaking the Eagles' six-game win streak at home.
Tookie Brown, who led all scorers with 25 points, tied the game at 61-61 with a free throw at 1:12 remaining. Each team missed from behind the 3-point arc in the last 44 seconds — Nottingham for the Bobcats (14-8, 7-2 Sun Belt) and Jake Allsmiller for Georgia Southern (14-7, 5-3).
Trailing by one with 3.7 seconds left and needing to go the length of the court, Georgia Southern threw a football-style over-the-shoulder inbounds pass to Brown, who was already running down court. The 5-foot-11 junior launched a 3-pointer on the run. The shot was on line, but hit the back of the rim and kicked out deep as time expired.
Immanuel King scored eight points for Texas State and his lone block moved him into seventh place on the school's all-time list.
