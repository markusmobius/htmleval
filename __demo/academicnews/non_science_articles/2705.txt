IRVING, Texas -- The NFL informed teams at the league meetings Tuesday that the per-team salary cap for 2017 is projected to be between $166 million and $170 million, a person with knowledge of the presentation told USA TODAY Sports.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose the numbers, which would represent another record high and another eight-figure jump from the $155.27 million cap this year. And the league's projections often have been a little low in the past.
The final cap is usually set just before free agency begins in March.
After an initial dip and flat stretch surrounding the 2011 collective bargaining agreement, the cap has risen from $123 million in 2013, coinciding with a spike in revenues.
