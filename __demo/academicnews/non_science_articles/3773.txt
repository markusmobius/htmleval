Labinowicz leads Coastal Carolina over Arkansas State 62-47
CONWAY, S.C. (AP) — Artur Labinowicz scored 17 points and matched a career-high with 10 rebounds to help Coastal Carolina beat Arkansas State 62-47 on Thursday night.
Coastal Carolina (9-13, 3-6 Sun Belt Conference) has won two straight since snapping a six-game skid. Arkansas State (7-14, 2-6) has lost six of its last seven games.
Labinowicz also had team-highs with three 3-pointers, two steals and two blocked shots. Jaylen Shaw added 13 points, eight assists and seven rebounds for the Chanticleers, who outrebounded Arkansas State 55-34, with four grabbing eight boards apiece.
The Red Wolves had three score in double figures despite miserable shooting. They missed 30 from long range and finished 17 of 68 (25 percent) from the field. Tristin Walley had 13 points, Grantham Gillard added 12 and Ty Cockfield had 10. Arkansas State was held to fewer than 50 points for the second time this season, the last a 31-point loss to Georgia Southern three weeks ago.
