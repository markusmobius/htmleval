Airline says women can avoid the middle seat
Indian airline Vistara: Women flying solo can skip middle seat
(CNN) — 
As the scourge of manspreading manspreads around the planet, one airline is taking steps to protect its women passengers.
Delhi-based carrier Vistara has launched a new service that guarantees women won't be allocated a middle seat. It's part of a series of measures introduced in March 2017 by the domestic airline to protect solo female fliers.

Vistara says its Woman Flyer initiative will "ensure only window or aisle seats are assigned to solo women travelers" -- even if customers do not select preferred seats in advance.
Upon arrival, Vistara staff will be available at baggage reclaim to offer assistance to female travelers with luggage. Staff will also be on hand to help women book airport-authorized taxis.

According to the Global Business Travel Association, India is poised to become the world's sixth-largest business travel market by 2019.
However the country has a problematic international reputation when it comes to women's safety, due to a slew of violent crimes.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the country has introduced train carriages and buses reserved for women and children only.
If India wants to strengthen its position as a business travel hub, services such as Vistara's initiative could pave the way forward.
