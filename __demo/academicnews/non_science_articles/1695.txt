The Screen Actors Guild Awards were Sunday night, but another gathering over the weekend proved to be an even bigger draw for A-list Hollywood types: the second annual Women’s March.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters and activists marched across the state on Saturday. In Los Angeles alone, an estimated half-million people gathered downtown wearing pink hats and bright costumes; participants chanted, delivered rousing speeches and warned against political apathy.
The marches this year were marked indelibly by the #MeToo movement, with Hollywood celebrities and activists taking the stage in Los Angeles to urge a social reckoning on sexual harassment and assault.
The Academy Award winner Viola Davis gave a stirring speech about the intersection of racial discrimination and women’s rights, denouncing the disproportionately high levels of sexual assault against women of color. She urged attendees not to forget women who do not have a voice.
“I am always introduced as an award-winning actor. But my testimony is one of poverty,” she told the crowd. “My testimony is one of being sexually assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me.
“The trauma of those events are still with me today. And that’s what drives me to the voting booth. That’s what allows me to listen to the women who are still in silence.”
Natalie Portman, also an Academy Award winner, described being sexually harassed during her early years in the industry and spoke of feeling the need to cover her body and create a public persona emphasizing “bookishness” to deflect unwanted comments about her body. She pushed back against critics who have said the #MeToo moment seeks a “puritanical” view of sex.
“Maybe men can say and do whatever they want, but women cannot,” she said. “The current system inhibits women from expressing our desires, wants and needs, from seeking our pleasure.
“I understood very quickly, even as a 13-year-old, that if I were to express myself sexually I would feel unsafe, and that men would feel entitled to discuss and objectify my body, to my great discomfort.”

The actress Scarlett Johansson described a mix of feelings brought on by the #MeToo conversation, including sadness, anger and guilt. “I’ve had many relationships both personal and professional where the power dynamic was so off that I had to create a narrative in which I was the cool girl who could hang in and hang out,” she said. “And that sometimes meant compromising what felt right for me.”
The program brought together the A-list actresses with lifelong activists. Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, urged those in the crowd to seize on the energy behind #MeToo to move forward other progressive causes.
“We refuse to be invisible,” she said. “We refuse to be harmed by Trump’s anti-immigration policies. We will fight back, we will stand up, and we will make sure that our families remain together.
“Sisters, brothers, we need you now more than ever,” she added. “In Washington, D.C., they don’t want us to have dreams or to have a future.”

A new study released last week brings some bitter clarity to an old mystery as California suffers one of the worst flu seasons on record: The flu can be transmitted simply by breathing, according to a team of researchers that included Sheryl Ehrman, an expert in aerosol science and droplets and the dean of engineering at San Jose State University.
Researchers invited students at the University of Maryland who were suffering from cold symptoms to breathe normally into a cone. Nearly 40 percent of the samples they collected had infectious virus.
“The findings suggest that if you just keep the surfaces around you clean and you wash your hands all the time and you avoid having people cough on you — that may not provide you complete protection,” Professor Ehrman said in an interview.
“It’s really important for people who are sick to stay home,” Professor Ehrman said. “If they are really sick they should go to the hospital. Please don’t come to work. Please don’t get on public transportation. Please don’t go to the grocery store.”
