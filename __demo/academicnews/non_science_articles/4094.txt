 Crazy Ex-Girlfriend: The CW embraces musical comedy in this brilliant gem
 Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The CW's weirdo musical comedy about mental illness, falling in love, and embracing the uncertainty of life. In series star Rachel Bloom — previously best known for her viral videos — the network found a truly fearless comedic performer, and the show's premise (about a young woman who ditches her high-powered job and moves across the country after a chance meeting with an old crush)Crazy Ex-Girlfriend subject matter and quirky musical numbers makes for something downright gleeful. In its third season, the s ever darker, but also ever more certain of a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s a remarkable balancing act.
 "The high bar that Bloom, [Aline Brosh] McKenna & Co. have set for themselves folds the creative process into the show’s ongoing, multifaceted spectacle." Matt Zoller Seitz, Vulture
