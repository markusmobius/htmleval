Anders Behring Breivik trial, day five - Friday 20 April
3.32pm: Here's a summary of today's proceedings.
• A detailed, graphic account given by Anders Behring Breivik of his killing spree on the island of Utøya, which left 69 people dead on 22 July last year, provoked the most emotional scenes of the trial so far. Many listened with tears in their eyes, with lawyers and journalists also visibly moved. Many Norwegians came down to the court building to leave flowers. Breivik described shooting teenagers who were paralysed with fear and taking shots at others "playing dead" on the floor when he could tell they were still alive.
• The defendant told the court he would not have gone to Utøya if the bomb attack on the government quarter had caused the building to collapse. Breivik claimed that if he had perceived the bombing to be a success, he would have driven to the police station and surrendered. The bomb killed eight people.
• Breivik denied having contact with the English Defence League (EDL), the anti-Islamist network formed in Britain in 2009. He admitted he had posted on internet forums "linked to the EDL" and had traded messages with an EDL member on one such website. But he insisted: "I have never had contact with the English Defence League." Previously, Breivik has written of having strong links with the EDL, saying he had met its leaders and had 600 EDL members as Facebook friends. Some EDL sources said Breivik had met some of its leaders but the leaders themselves and the party deny this.
• The accused described himself as a "nice person, sympathetic" who was "quite normal up until 2006 when I started training".  He also denied that he was racist, insisting he was fighting against anti-European racism carried out by "the Norwegian media and the Marxist elites". He said: "I am not a racist. I am an anti-racist."
• Breivik said he had chosen not to empathise with the those whose lives he had ruined as a self-preservation technique. He compared his preparation with that of soldiers going to war. Asked how he was able to talk about the atrocities in such an impassive manner, Breivik said he had learned to rely on "technical, de-emotionalised language" — "if I was going to use normalised language it would not have been possible" to go through police interviews and the trial.
3.10pm: The Guardian's Helen Pidd, in court, in Oslo, describes Breivik's testimony and the impact it had:
Before Breivik began his account of what happened on Utoya, he warned the courtroom that people should consider leaving because much of what he was about to say was "horrendous". He wasn't wrong. In 90 minutes of uninterrupted testimony, the 33-year-old described the island massacre from the moment he tricked his way on to the ferry over, dressed as a policeman, to when he was finally arrested.
Few people left the courtroom as he gave evidence, but there were tears in the eyes of many listening to his account. Lawyers bit their lips. The parents of some of the children killed held each other tight. Experienced journalists said they were finding it difficult to keep it together and that they had never heard anything as terrible. Outside, there were reports that many Norwegians had come spontaneously down to the court building to leave flowers.
The 33-year-old described shooting teenagers who were paralysed with fear, taking shots at others "playing dead" on the floor when he could tell they were still alive. With dozens already dead, he stalked the island in search of "the sort of places I would hide" and shot dead children he spotted trying to make themselves invisible, pressing themselves up against a cliff.
3.08pm: The court has now adjourned for the day after terrible, harrowing testimony from Breivik in which he gave a detailed, graphic account of his killing spree on Utøya, which left 69 people dead.
2.59pm: Breivik is now being questioned by the prosecution. How must the bereaved relatives and survivors feel when they hear the man responsible describe events on Utøya as horrible, as he denies laughing during his killing spree?
 I have heard that some Labour youth said I was laughting. I never laughed or smiled when I was there. It was horrible. #Breivik
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
 At least I can not remember smiling. #Breivik
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
2.50pm: Freelance journalist Trygve Sorvaag describes Breivik's demeanour, which must have made his description of the Utøya massacre even harder for survivors and bereaved relatives to bear. 
 #Breivik is cold. Leans back in his chair. Even speaks with some kind of enthusiasm when questioned about killings.
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
2.38pm: The harrowing details of Breivik's killing spree on Utøya have provoked an outpouring of emotion outside the court as well as inside.

2.30pm: Now Breivik recalls how he was arrested.
 #Breivik says he saw a group of 6 people, and I think that they are Delta. First I thought about attacking them, but that was not objective
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik so I threw down my rifle. One of them called 'Lie down on your knees!' and I thought 'what exactly should I do now?'
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: "And I thought if I put up an argument now, they will shoot me in the head, so I lay down on the ground." And they asked him...
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: ...whether he had any explosives on his body. And he said no. They asked were there others. Said no, but they didn't believe him
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 I was arrested only 5-10 metres from were I shot someone. Was kept there a while. #Breivik
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik says he was then taken to main house where they started interviewing him and it went on for some 5 hours.
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
2.26pm: The defendant says he shot two more people and then spared a terrified young boy.
 I spared a young boy crying hysterically. I told him he would be OK. He was too young. #Breivik
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
2.23pm: Breivik says that after he shot some more people he thought of taking his own life.
 #Breivik: "And I thought, do I really want to survive this? I will be the most hated man in Norway. And I looked over and saw my Glock..."
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: "...and I thought about shooting myself in the head."Says he remembered his compendium and the plan to face judicial process.
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
2.14pm: The awful details continue. Breivik talks about shooting at a group of four or five people from a distance He thinks he killed two of them. 
He then went to the Pump House and tricked people by asking "Have you seen him?" One of the people there who he killed pleaded to be spared. 
 #Breivik tells of how he tricked people - asking them "where is the terrorist?" Some believed him and came closer. Then he shot them.
 — Matthew Price (@matthewwprice) April 20, 2012
 
 I remember one saying "Please mate". But I shot all of them. #Breivik
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
2.03pm: Breivik says he saw some boats helping Labour youth members flee and shot towards them. He thinks he hit two people. It was at this point that he called the police.
 I thought my mission was accompliched by now and called police emergency number. Could not find my own mobile. Picks up a mobile.
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
 I try several times, but get busy signal with police. Get through in the end. Want to surrender. #Breivik
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
 What am I doing now? Since police do not call back I assume they will not accept my surrender. Contine killing till police call back.
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
2.00pm: The court is back in session. Please do be warned that there is likely to be more upsetting content as Breivik continues his description of the massacre he committed on Utøya.
1.51pm: Unsurprisingly, there has been an emotional response to Breivik's horrific description of his killing spree on Utøya. 
 People are crying as #Breivik is taken away in handcuffs. No one takes pictures of him now. #Breivik
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
 Journalists openly crying next to me. Some families and survivors contemplating leaving. This is very difficult to listen to. #Breivik

 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
1.13pm: Breivik chillingly describes how he shot the off-duty police guard, Trond Berntsen, 51, and then "Mother Utøya", Monica Bosei, 45, who had organised the Labour youth camp for 20 years.
 I held a pistol ready. Took it out. Thought it is now or never. When i lifted the weapons "mother Utøya" told me not to point weapon.
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
 Shot off duty guard first. Then "mother Utøya". Shot them several times. Started to hear shouting around me. #Breivik

 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: says a guard ran, and he was too far away to shoot in th head, but I shot him so he fell, then shot him in the head.
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
1.06pm: He moves on to describing how he encountered an off-duty police guard on the island. 
 This is awful: Breivik describing how he tricked Utøya's head of security into believing he was a policeman coming to reassure the camp.
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
 "I so didn't want to do this." #Breivik about to shoot first persons.

 #Breivik: "I was walking with rifle in my hand, in a bag. I thought, it's now or never. That minute seemed to last for a year."
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik:"When I took the weapon in my hand, it was like 100 voices in my head saying 'don't do it, don't do it."
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
12.58pm: The defendant begins to chronologically go through the events leading up to the massacre on Utøya.
 #Breivik says he parked up out of sight, changed, took off armour, put on combat vest with a lot of magazines, put blue lights on his car.
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik was wearing his fake police uniform, and was concerned it might not be realistic enough. He told them there had been 'terrorist...

 #Breivik: ...attack, and that he had been stationed on island as a precaution. The ferry had been cancelled but Breivik ordered it to return

12.33pm: The accused is being questioned by the forensic psychiatrists now.
 Forensic psychiatrist Huseby asks why he thinks they have lied in their report. #Breivik says he should answer that.
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
 Forensic psychiatrist Terje Tørrissen asks why #Breivik use spesific figures and % when he talks.
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik explains figures are effective way of communication. He likes using figures here, but not in "normal" conversations.
 — Trygve Sorvaag (@TrygveSorvaag) April 20, 2012
 
The defendant has used percentages a lot to describe how he perceived his chances of "success" in his attacks and claimed the bomb in the government quarter of Oslo was 30% less effective because the parking spot he intended for it was taken. Breveik also talked of being able to accept 2% of people in Norway not being "ethnically pure Norwegians".
12.19pm: This morning Breivik claimed he had not had contact with the English Defence League (EDL) but that is in contrast to previous claims made on both sides. From the Daily Telegraph, in July, last year:
Daryl Hobson, who organises EDL demonstrations, said Breivik, who told police there were "two more cells" ready to follow him, had met members of the group ...
Breivik wrote of having strong links with the EDL, saying he had met its leaders and had 600 EDL members as Facebook friends.
Mr Hobson said in an online posting that: "He had about 150 EDL on his list … bar one or two doubt the rest of us ever met him, altho [sic] he did come over for one of our demo [sic] in 2010 … but what he did was wrong. RIP to all who died as a result of his actions."
Another senior member of the EDL, who spoke to The Daily Telegraph on condition of anonymity, said he understood Breivik had met EDL leaders when he came to Britain to hear Wilders speak in London last year ...
The source said Breivik began making friend requests with EDL members on Facebook in 2009 and knew "three or four" people in the group.
Breivik told his Facebook friends he would be coming to London for Wilders's visit. "I remember he [Breivik] was on Facebook saying that he felt he had to come over. Maybe he thought it was the only chance he'd get to come to a big demo," said the source.
"Geert Wilders was a high-profile anti-Islamic politician, coming to Britain. Every­one was raving about it.
"He [Breivik] was obviously in contact with some of us. If this bloke was coming all the way from Norway the leadership would have wanted to meet him."
The EDL leader Stephen Lennon denied meeting Breivik and the EDL said on its webiste that it had no links to him.
12.08pm: The court is back in session and Breivik is asked what he did to avoid the need for violence. He responds "everything"; violence was the last resort, he claims.
 Breivik: violence was last resort: previously tried "everything that was possible through peaceful means until I lost my faith in democracy"
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
 "Everything" means "normal involvement through political parties, writing essays, communicating or writing comments on the internet"
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
11.56am: The afternoon session is due to begin at 12pm BST.
Helen Pidd, in Oslo, has filed a news story on this morning's proceedings. I'll post the link when it's up on the Guardian website but in the meantime here's an extract:
Anders Behring Breivik has denied having contact with the English Defence League (EDL), the anti-Islamist network formed in Britain in 2009.
Giving evidence in the fifth day of his ten-week trial for killing 77 people in Norway last year, the 33-year-old admitted he had posted on internet forums "linked to the EDL" and had traded messages with an EDL member on one such website. But he insisted: "I have never had contact with the English Defence League."
He told the court that the EDL was fundamentally different from the Knights Templar (KT), the anti-immigration network of "militant nationalists" to which he professes to belong. He said: "The EDL is an anti-violent organisation supporting democracy ...and they have nothing to do with KT at all. You cannot even compare them."
Questioned by his own lawyers as to how he was able to carry out the attacks which killed 77 in Norway last summer, Breivik described a "meditation" technique he had developed which mixed "Christian prayer" and Japanese "Bushido warrior codex" practised by Samurai fighters.
He insisted on Friday he was a "nice person" who was capable of empathising with those whose lives he had ruined, but that he had chosen not to as a self-preservation technique. "In many ways it is a protection mechanism," he said. "First of all, if you are going to be capable of executing such a bloody and horrendous operation you need to work on your mind, your psyche for years. We have seen from military traditions you cannot send an unprepared person into war."
11.10am: I mentioned earlier that Norwegian papers have not put Breivik on their front pages today (see 8.05am). Here is an interesting front page from today's Morgenbladet (a Norwegian weekly). It shows a picture of Breivik but his face has been removed and replaced by the words "Se på meg" (Look at me). (Thanks to Eivind Krohg @Krohg on Twitter for sending through the link).
 Skal vi bare være enige om at Morgenbladet vant i dag? twitter.com/MoHanssen/stat…
 — Anders Mo Hanssen (@MoHanssen) April 20, 2012
 
11.02am: The court has adjourned for lunch for one hour.
10.55am: The accused outlines the Norwegian culture he wants to "protect",  citing even door handles.
 Breivik asked to describe Norwegian culture he wants to protect: "It's everything in Norway ranging from door handles, patterns, beer..."
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
 "...The way we speak, act... school disciple, politeness, the way we address each other." (Breivik's idea of what is Norwegian culture)
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
10.52am: Breivik has already described women as lacking comprehension and "backbone" and crticised the culture he says is turning boys into girls. Now he challenges the knowledge of a female lawyer.
 Breivik does not seem to respect women - challenges female lawyer who mentions Masonic philosophy. "How do you know? It's reserved for men."
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
10.22am: Breivik says that he partied a lot from 2010 to 2011. Earlier, in the trial he was keen to reject perceptions of himself as a loner, saying he had lots of friends but stopped seeing them to concentrate on his "operation". But today he says he partied "until the end".
 Breivik says he partied "at least once a month" from 2010 to 2011, right "until the end". Went clubbing, drinking.
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
10.18am: The accused is asked about his relationship with his family and says it is good.
 Breivik: "I've always had a good relationship to my mother, I guess i've had a good relationship with all of my family."
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
 Breivik says he wd urge his retired mother to get a hobby, but she would say to him, "you're my hobby". They ate together, talked once a day
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: step-father lives in Thailand. Sent him an SMS message a year ago, but didn't hear back.
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: sister lives in Los Angeles, spoke one a month, and because couldn't tell her real intent, she believed him a games addict.
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
10.15am: Breivik is talking about the day of the attack and how it was only the bomb's "failure" (it killed eight people but the accused said yesterday that he wanted to slay a minimum of 12 and for the government building to collapse) that made him take the decision to go to Utøya.
 #Breivik: talking about day of bombing. "I was in fight or flight mode. When I saw car parked in space I wanted, I ust had to adapt."
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: says there were gasses coming off device as he prepared to light fuse. Says he expected it to explode and kill him/
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: "Starting point was not to kill as many as possible, but to send a message and ensure the compendium was distributed."
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: "If the building had collapsed, Utoya would have been unnecessary, and I could have driven straight to the police station...
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: "...and surrendered."
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik: says when he heard on radio the bomb attack had "failed", it was then he decided to travel to Utoya.
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
10.03am: Breivik is asked about how he gained his bomb-making expertise without being discovered. 
 Breivik says he was forced to operate as a 1-man cell b/c the Norwegian secret service know too much. "Unfortunately for us, good for them."
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
 Breivik ordered explosive fuses in Dec so he could pretend he needed them for New Years Eve fireworks and when postal service most busy.
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
 #Breivik says he masked his IP address to make himself anonymous on the internet, to prevent himself being flagged by intel services.
 — Paul Brennan (@paulrbrennan) April 20, 2012
 
9.59am: After lauding al-Qaida for its members' willingness to "embrace" martyrdom, Breveik reveals how he overcame his own fear of death. His reference to samurai fits with his own perception of himself as some kind of heroic warrior.
 Breivik says he combated fear of death through Christian prayer and the Japanese Bushido "warrior codex" used by samurai fighters.
 — Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) April 20, 2012
 
9.54am: Proceedings are underway once more, with Breivik being questioned by his defence counsel about al-Qaida, who the accused has referred to as "methodological role models" during the trial.
 #Breivik says AQ was created *after* 9/11

9.50am: Helen Pidd, in court in Oslo, has sent through this summary of today's opening session:
The Breivik who is giving evidence today on the fifth day of his ten-week trial is probably the most confident and fluent we have seen him all week. Whether or not he is "criminally insane" in the eyes of the court, there is no doubt that he planned every aspect of his attacks in cold, clinical detail - and he seems to be enjoying demonstrating the extent of his preparations and knowledge
Nothing was left to chance. He has told the court today how he carried out test blasts 2km from his farm during a thunder storm so as not to arouse suspicion; how he learned an unusual bomb making technique from Andreas Baader from the Red Army Action. Yesterday we heard how he made a sign to put in the window of the hire car where he planted the bomb warning of "sewage works" to explain the sulphuric smell. He also says he consulted 600 different bomb making manuals on the internet but in the end concocted his own "recipe".
Earlier in the week, Breivik was evasive and truculent in the witness box, refusing to answer more than 150 questions related to the Knights Templar anti-Islamic network he claims to be a part of. The prosecution do not believe such a group exists and say that Breivik was alone terrorist, an assertion Breivik repeatedly denies. But today, admitting he alone worked out how to build a deadly bomb, he is animated, eloquent, giving expansive answers to questions put to him by his defence team.
We know already that the 33-year-old is rather sensitive about being ahigh school drop-out - he has repeatedly stressed that though he does not have a school leaving certificate, he has carried out "15,000"hours of independent study. Today he is revelling in the opportunity to show just how much knowledge he had learned about explosives in order to carry out the Oslo bomb attack which left eight dead and dozens more seriously injured.
9.31am: The court has adjourned for a 20-minute break. 
During the recess, it is well worth reading this online Q&A with a survivor of the Utøya massacre on Reddit. It is fascinating reading, terrifying, tragic and moving but also heartwarming in the survivor's response to being caught up in such an unimaginable atrocity.
It begins:
I am a 17-years-old, and a Utøya survivor. I was at the closest 20m away from Anders Behring Breivik. After the shooting started I was on the island for two hours and could have died approximately six times in those two hours. I'm not doing so bad, I have good days and bad days but I'm alive. I just wanted to get things off my chest ...I just wanted people to know that what ever happens, there is always a way to get through though things! And I hope everyone is doing well! : )
And here are a couple of the answers given:
Q How has your life changed since the incident? Do you consider yourself a different person because of this experience?
A Of course did it changed me, I've become a stronger human being. It has also made me more confident and more prescient when it comes to believing in what you stand for. I am not a person who is easily knocked down.
Q This may be a bit personal, but if you had the opportunity to confront Breivik is there anything you wish you could tell him? Also, thank you to you and your fellow Norwegians for the civil way everyone has responded. It's an attitude I wish more people in my country would emulate.
A That I get why he did it, but that I think that going after children, I consider myself still a child, it's way beyond every other choice he could have chosen to prove his point.
9.14am: After repeating his assertion yesterday that the bomb was less effective than he had hoped (he says 30% less effective) because his intended parking spot was taken, Breivik is now being asked by his defence counsel about Utøya.
 Breivik carried out a "reconnaissance mission" to Utøya to check out the ferry; also checked Labour party youth website for camp programme.

8.51am: The defence moves on to ask Breivik about his detailed knowledge of bomb-making, which was evident in court yesterday when he described the manufacture of the device that killed eight people in the government quarter on 22 July (at one point there was discussion in court about whether he was going in to too much detail).
 Breivik on how bombmaking: "On the internet I did research and I gained access to more than 600 guides of how to produce explosives."

8.18am: Now the accused is lining up an array of targets to blame for "anti-European racism". Many of them he has mentioned before in court - journalists, authorities, schools - but he also mentions writers of children's songs.
 #Breivik: "100%. All media in Norway. In Europe. Belong to multiculturalism. And all want to defend the multicultural experiment."

 Breivik on his conscious "distancing": "If I tried to use a more normal language I don't think I would be able to talk about this at all."

7.59am: Good morning. Welcome to live coverage of day five of the trial of Anders Behring Breivik.
TV cameras continue to be barred from proceedings during Breivik's testimony, to avoid giving him a direct platform for his views, but we'll bring you updates from the journalists inside the court including the Guardian's Helen Pidd.
Yesterday's proceedings were the most disturbing so far as the accused told the court that his "primary target" in last year's terrorist attacks was former prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, whom he planned to behead, posting the footage on the internet – and that he anticipated all 564 people on Utøya would die in his "operation".
Breivik's defence team have warned survivors and beraeaved relatives that today is likely to be difficult for them as focus will be on the killing spree on Utøya.
