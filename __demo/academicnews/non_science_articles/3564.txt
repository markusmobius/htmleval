Tim Duncan: A timeline of a legend
A look back at the career of one of the NBA's most storied stars.
After 19 seasons, 1,643 total games, 56,738 total minutes, 31,668 total points, five championships and two MVP awards — Tim Duncan has retired. We take you back through his two decades of basketball dominance, from that 1997 draft day to the fifth and final championship.
The Beginning

Date: June 25, 1997
Just two months after his 21st birthday, Duncan — the consensus NCAA Player of the Year during his senior season at Wake Forest, where he averaged 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.3 blocks — took the first step of his legendary NBA journey when he was selected with the No. 1 overall pick by the San Antonio Spurs.
The Spurs, a franchise headlined by Hall of Fame big man David "The Admiral" Robinson, stumbled upon the first pick after a franchise-worst 20-62 season. A season in which Robinson played just six games as a result of back and foot injuries. A season that set two decades of dominance in motion.
The First Award
Date: April 28, 1998
The same 20-win Spurs team that felt the ill-effects of Robinson's injuries the year before quickly transformed into a 56-win championship contender after drafting Duncan and naming Gregg Popovich head coach.
Coincidence?
The Spurs fell short in the Western Conference semifinals at the hands of the Utah Jazz, but the franchise was clearly on the right track.
Duncan was a key contributor in the turnaround, posting 21.1-point, 11.9-rebound, 2.7-assist, 2.5-block numbers while shooting 54.9% from the field and playing a team-high 39.1 minutes — numbers that earned him Rookie of the Year honors. He was a near-unanimous decision, raking in 113 of 116 first-place votes, and was also named to the All-NBA First Team, becoming the first rookie to do so since Larry Bird in 1980.
But it was just the beginning.
The First Championship

Date: June 25, 1999
In just his second season, Duncan became an NBA champion.
With regular-season averages of 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks, Duncan — side-by-side with a healthy Robinson — led the Spurs to a league-best 37-13 record (shortened by lockout). After handily advancing past the Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers in the first three rounds of the postseason, the Spurs knocked off the New York Knicks (4-1) for the first championship in franchise history.
Duncan, who averaged 27.4 points, 14.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.2 blocks, was named Finals MVP, becoming the second-youngest player (23) in NBA history to do so, behind Magic Johnson.

The Injury
Date: April 11, 2000
Duncan, one of the healthier superstars in league history, suffered a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee late in his third NBA season. The Spurs, who entered the postseason as the fourth seed in the West, only managed to win one game and were quickly sent home by the Phoenix Suns.
A disappointing finish at the time, of course, but the decision to rest the 24-year-old and let his knee heal would turn out to be one of the most important calls of Popovich's Hall of Fame coaching career.
The 53-point Game
Date: December 26, 2001
Duncan, known as The Big Fundamental for his silky-smooth offensive skill set, didn't make a living torching defenses with explosive dunks or alley-oop finishes, but that's not to say he didn't have his fair share of dominant offensive performances over the course of his career.
The day after Christmas in the 2001-02 season was one of those performances.
Duncan was as locked in as ever, knocking down 19 of his 28 shot attempts on the way to a career-high 53-point outing in 50 minutes on the floor. The Spurs lost the game in overtime, but not to the fault of Duncan, who was a perfect 15-for-15 from the free throw line and added 11 rebounds, four assists and three blocks.
The First MVP

Date: May 9, 2002
After five seasons in the league, with five All-NBA First Team and four All-Defensive First Team selections, one championship and one Finals MVP, and just a season after finishing second in the regular-season MVP race to Allen Iverson, Duncan added to his already-impressive resume with his first MVP award.
He posted career-high (at the time) averages of 25.5 points and 12.7 rebounds while leading the Spurs to a 58-24 finish for the second consecutive year. They eventually lost in the Western Conference semifinals to the Lakers, but Duncan's emergence as a franchise cornerstone was undeniable.
The Second MVP
Date: May 5, 2003
Another year, another MVP award for The Big Fundamental.
With season-long averages of 23.3 points, 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks, Duncan became just the eighth player in NBA history, and the first since Michael Jordan (1991 and '92), to win back-to-back MVPs, as he led the Spurs to an NBA-best 60-22 record in the regular season.
The Passing of the Torch

Date: June 15, 2003
While there may not have been a definitive passing of the torch moment from Robinson to Duncan, when The Admiral played his final game, a Finals-winning Game 6 against the New Jersey Nets, Duncan was officially handed the keys to one of the NBA's most dominant franchises.
Duncan — who put up 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists and eight blocks in Game 6 — finished the series with team-high averages of 24.2 points, 17.0 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 5.3 blocks in one of the most dominant Finals outings in NBA history.
The Almost Game-Winner
Date: May 13, 2004
In a knock-down, drag-out Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Lakers, Duncan responded to a Kobe Bryant go-ahead basket with a fadeaway go-ahead of his own that splashed home with just 0.4 seconds remaining.
The shot itself, in the face of Hall of Fame center Shaquille O'Neal, would have been one of the most monumental shots of Duncan's career ... if it weren't for Derek Fisher, who proceeded to knock down one of the more recognized buzzer-beaters in NBA postseason history on the next possession.
The Lakers went on to win the series, putting an end to the defending champs' quest for back-to-back titles.
The Third Championship
Date: June 23, 2005
After the heartbreaking elimination the year before, Duncan — alongside a young Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili — came back with a vengeance.
With a 59-23 regular season record that earned them the second seed in the West, the Spurs rolled through the first three rounds of the playoffs, losing just four games.
In the Finals, they faced a much more daunting task, as they met the defending champion Detroit Pistons, led by Chauncey Billups, Rip Hamilton, Ben and Rasheed Wallace, and Tayshaun Prince.
In an 81-74 Game 7 victory, Duncan struggled from the field (10-for-27), but scored 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds on the way to his third Finals MVP, and his first title without Robinson. He became the fourth player in NBA history (Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal) to win three Finals MVPs.
The Sweep

Date: June 14, 2007
The Spurs' franchise-best 63-win season the year before was cut short in the second round of the playoffs by Dirk Nowitzki's Dallas Mavericks. But, as they did in years past, San Antonio made a mockery of the postseason opposition on the way to the 2007 Finals.
Once they got there, it was more of the same.
Experienced and hungry for yet another ring, San Antonio cruised to a 4-0 Finals victory against a 22-year-old LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers squad. Parker (24.5 points, 3.3 assists, 5.0 rebounds) edged Duncan, who averaged 18.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 2.3 blocks, for Finals MVP honors.
The 20-20
Date: December 2, 2013
At 37 years, 221 days old, Duncan — with his game-winning fadeaway jumper against the Atlanta Hawks — became the oldest player in NBA history to record a 20-point, 20-rebound game. It was the 22nd 20-20 game of his career.
Despite Father Time's best efforts, Duncan continued to turn back the clock.
The Disappointing Finish
Date: June 20, 2013
For the first time in franchise history, the Spurs lost in the NBA Finals.
The Spurs — who could taste victory in Game 6 — fell victim to a Ray Allen game-tying three-pointer, which led to a Heat win, kept Miami alive and set up a 95-88 series-clinching Game 7.
Duncan posted team high averages of 18.9 points and 12.1 rebounds over the course of the seven games, but it ultimately wasn't enough.
The Last Championship

Date: June 15, 2014
A year later, the Spurs got their revenge.
Duncan, at 38 years old, averaged 15.4 points, 10.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and shot 56.9% from the field as the Spurs handily took down Miami's Big Three in five games. Spurs 22-year-old defensive specialist Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP, but Duncan played a pivotal role on the way to his fifth — and final — ring, 15 years after winning his first.
Rumors circulated regarding his retirement plans, but Duncan wasn't done just yet.
The 1,000th Win
Date: April 5, 2016
During the final stretch of his 19-year career, Duncan became the third player in NBA history to reach the 1,000-win plateau, joining Hall of Fame big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish.
But, the game was far from your classic Duncan performance, as he recorded just three points, two assists and two rebounds in 24 minutes of play, just weeks before his 40th birthday.
The End
Date: May 12, 2016
In what would turn out to be the final game of his career, Duncan scored 19 points and grabbed five rebounds in a Western Conference semifinals loss against the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was his best performance of the 2016 postseason.
In the previous nine games, he failed to score in double-digits and, in Game 4 of the Western Conference semis, was held scoreless for the first time in his postseason career (249 games).
So famously deemed Timeless Tim Duncan for his ability to fend off Father Time year after year, the 40-year-old looked like a 40-year-old.
The Announcement

Date: July 11, 2016
As a leader of one of the most dominant franchises in basketball history, with a career overflowing with accolades, Duncan ended it all by riding off in the sunset in a manner so reserved, so peaceful, with a short and sweet press release sent out by the Spurs. No fancy farewell tours or press conferences.
For the humblest and most soft-spoken of NBA superstars, did you really expect anything else? An ending so fitting to a career so far-reaching.
