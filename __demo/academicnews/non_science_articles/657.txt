I find new grey hairs on my head every day and I LOVE THEM. I’m only 24, so I’m not sure why they’re already here but I call them my unicorn hairs. 😂🦄

I’ve had a natural white streak in my hair since I was 19. 13 years later I still love it pic.twitter.com/fv5yxS3Gf3

Teigen’s tweet about her hair is just one of many refreshingly real posts she’s shared over the years. A few years ago, millions of the supermodel’s fans rejoiced when she shared a photo of her stretch marks. 
“Bruises from bumping kitchen drawer handles for a week. Stretchies say hi!” Teigen captioned the picture.

Much like her gray hair moment above, fans praised Teigen for being so honest and open with her “stretchies.” The photo also motivated people to share their personal journeys with their own stretch marks. 
Teigen keeps on inspiring people, one photo and tweet at a time.
