A look at the new Canopy by Hilton Washington, D.C., The Wharf
Last SlideNext Slide
The first North American Canopy by Hilton has debuted in one of Washington, D.C.’s newest neighborhoods—the Wharf.
The Canopy by Hilton Washington, D.C. The Wharf is part of the $2.5 billion Hoffman-Madison Waterfront redevelopment of the property set on the Potomac River. The mile-long stretch has several new restaurants, shops, hotels and residences. A second phase of the project will continue into next year.
The hotel has 175 rooms and a rooftop bar and lounge called Whiskey Charlie.
The Canopy brand is one of Hilton’s newest additions to its portfolio. The first property opened in Reykjavik, Iceland.
Hilton officials call it a “lifestyle” hotel, one focused on locally-inspired design, food and beverage offerings, environmentally friendly features, and large multi-use public spaces.
Gary Steffen, global head of Canopy by Hilton, says unlike many other hotel chains, Hilton is not trying to attract a younger demographic. 
“There are people, regardless of age and demographic, looking for these experiences,” he says.
The hotel does not have a traditional front desk. Instead, it has a more informal welcome area. An artisanal breakfast is included with the stay as well as a nightly tasting of craft beers, wines or cocktails.
Each hotel is meant to be bespoke. The Iceland Canopy has more industrial and Scandinavian touches while the D.C. one has a nautical theme, floor-to-ceiling windows for views of the River, and warm beige and gray tones.
“Every one of our hotels will speak to the neighborhood,” Steffen says.
