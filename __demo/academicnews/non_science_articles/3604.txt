Grades for all 130 FBS teams for the 2017 season
Grades for all 130 FBS teams for the 2017 season, including A+ for Alabama

Pencils down. Eyes front. Attention, please. It’s been a long year, but it’s time to hand out some report cards.
Since September, USA TODAY Sports has been keeping close tabs on how each team in the Football Bowl Subdivision has performed relative to its preseason expectations.
Some teams have done remarkably well — and for that, an A+ grade is in order. Some have done just fine. Others have come up short of reaching their potential. And even a few were disappointing enough to draw the most dreaded grade of all: the F.
Congratulations to those who passed with flying colors. To those on the low end of the grading scale, be sure to make the most of your offseason. And don’t forget: All grades are relative, so not all win-loss records are created equal.
