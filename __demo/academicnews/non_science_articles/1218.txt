When it comes to extraterrestrial life, Bill Nye is a true believer. 
In an interview with HuffPost Live on Thursday, Nye said that with so many galaxies in the universe, chances are that alien life exists somewhere. 
"It's gotta exist outside the solar system," he told host Josh Zepps. "I mean there's 200 billion stars in this galaxy alone. Then you start talking about the hundreds of billions of galaxies. Hundreds of billions of galaxies, which in turn have hundreds of billions of stars, which in turn have tens of hundreds of billions -- trillions -- of planets. Come on!"
