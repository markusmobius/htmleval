Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this post misidentified John Boyega’s character in the film.
Kathryn Bigelow is back.
The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty director (who remains the only woman to have ever won the best director Oscar) has a new film on the schedule for 2017, and an intense trailer for it was released Wednesday. Though Bigelow has focused on recent events in her two big films (the war in Iraq and the hunt for Osama bin Laden), Detroit takes place during the 1967 riot in the titular city, where 43 people were killed and nearly 1,200 injured. The film focuses on a black security guard (John Boyega) as well as a group of people who get involved because of a prank. The movie also stars Jacob Latimore, John Krasinski, Will Poulter and Anthony Mackie (who appeared in The Hurt Locker).
Detroit hits theaters Aug. 4.
