#CNNiReport: Share your story - CNN
(CNN)
Do you have news to share with CNN? You've come to the right place.
We want to hear about the stories that matter to you — important issues in your community, a personal experience you're going through or your perspective on the news of the day.
Post your photo and story below, or you can get it here by posting it on Instagram or Twitter with the hashtag #CNNiReport.
Our producers will take a look at your post and may contact you for more information.
If you're looking for story inspiration, go to our Assignment Desk to see what projects we're working on.
