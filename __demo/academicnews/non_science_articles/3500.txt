 Nicolas Cage stars as a motel manager who discovers some dark secrets in the voyeuristic thriller 'Looking Glass.' Momentum Pictures
Hear us out: What if an insane movie existed where Nicolas Cage wasn't the craziest thing in it?
In Looking Glass, the Oscar-winning actor stars as a newly minted motel manager and bearded everyman who finds all sorts of weird things going on at his place. Check out the exclusive first trailer for the voyeuristic thriller (in select theaters and video-on-demand and digital HD platforms like iTunes on Feb. 16).

Ray (Cage) and Maggie (Robin Tunney) buy an out-of-the-way desert motel and one day, Ray discovers a hidden crawlspace where he can see into every one of the rooms — including a frequently requested one where some crazy stuff happens. When a guest winds up dead, a pesky policeman (Marc Blucas) comes calling and Ray's life turns into a very intense whodunit.
The Cage-y one seems the center of orbiting oddities here rather than the primary nutball — like his murderous dad in the new horror comedy Mom & Dad or the violent man on a mission in Sundance revenge thriller Mandy. But there's at least one bit of snake-handling and some serious Cage dancing at a club, so it's not like he's gone boring on us.
