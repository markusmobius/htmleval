We all know there’s a bit of scrutiny and even a bit of negative feedback regarding Tampa Bay Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht’s decision to retain coach Dirk Koetter along with all of his assistants.
Licht made that decision final after picking up the club option for Tampa Bay’s assistants even despite the Bucs’ brutal 5-11 finish this season.
As a result, fans have fired at Licht on social media platforms questioning his decisions and recent offseason moves.
So Jameis Winston took to Twitter to to defend his general manager by replying to a random fan’s comment in support of Licht. The fan shared the following message to Winston:
 I know for a fact that @Jaboowins supports @jasonrlicht 💯 @CommishOnline

Moments later, Winston responded to the remark making it crystal clear that he supports Licht’s decisions all day and every day no matter what.
 All day errrday!! https://t.co/B1qfoGaiMO
