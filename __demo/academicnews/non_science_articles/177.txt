Web exclusive: will Cuba loosen its grip on media and widen Internet access?
Does the renewing of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba augur an flourishing of independent media and Internet access on the island? Brian Stelter asks New York Times editorial board member Ernesto Londoño, recently back from a trip to Havana, and OnCuba editor in chief Hugo Cancio.
"People desperately want the Internet and it seems clear to me that the state has used Internet access to control information fairly tightly," Londoño said.
He said the Cuban government has recently signaled that it wants to expand access.
"And if they keep their word, I think that could have a transformational effect," he said. "I think the more information that flows freely, the more Cubans will start debating and challenging the system. And I think that would have a very healthy impact."
