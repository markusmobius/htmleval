Policing the USA: Is media missing mark on race?
CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE
Darrell McGraw was walking out of a Baltimore City convenience store when he was pushed to the ground by police, with very little explanation given, he says. He was kicked, slapped, punched. He was interrogated all for what he says was mistaken identity. The coverage of his treatment was negligible. And he thinks that often when news organizations do venture into his Baltimore City neighborhood, it’s to report something negative about himself and other black men who look and live like him. Is he right? What could journalists do better? What biases and issues do we carry with us when covering stories about race, and could our efforts be part of the problem?
We tell McGraw’s story, get his views on police treatment and news coverage, talk to media scholars and host a series of roundtable discussions about race and media in the podcast below.
