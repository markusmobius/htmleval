Audi TT Coupe: Playing It Safe With AudiÂ’s Icon
What's the Point? The first TT rolled down American roads in 1998. Little on the car has changed since then, prompting Audi to reshape, revamp and revive what many consider to be the companyÂs most progressively styled vehicle.
The Company Line: ÂThe TT became a cult car, a design icon. Now the second generation is making its debut, and it is even more dynamic than its predecessor,Â said Ralph Weyler, Audi AG board member.
The View From Here: The new TT holds true to many of the stylistic elements that made the original so easy on the eye Â the sloping back end, squatty stance and circular form. Both longer and wider than its predecessor, it seems a generation more mature.
What Makes It Tick? You have two choices: A 2.0-liter, 200-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder or a 3.2-liter, 250-horsepower V-6.
How Much, How Soon? Expect the 3.2-liter TT to cost slightly more than the $43,000 base price of the current version; four-cylinder cars will be a few thousand less. Audi plans to put the TT in dealerships next spring.
How's It Look? Audi managed to hold true to most of the core TT architecture yet produce a design thatÂs still fresh Â even though itÂs been nine years since the original made its debut.
