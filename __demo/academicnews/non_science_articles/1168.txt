 "Mr. Twitter Fingers" aka Meek Mill started the beef of the year with Drake after he wrote a series of tweets, which accused Drake of using a ghostwriter -- to which Drake did not reply. The Toronto rapper instead recorded two diss songs directed at Meek, one of which, “Back To Back,” became the first diss record ever to be nominated for a Grammy. So who won the beef, well, the Internet can answer that one for you.

 Silento's single "Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)" was a summer smash hit that you couldn't go to any party, open any social media app or catch a daytime TV show without seeing someone attempt to do the dance. But Atlanta group WeAreToonz invented the dance in their basement and even released a song called "Drop That Nae Nae," in 2013. Two years and one hit song later the dance is still going strong. We see you, Hillary!

In an interview with Chicago magazine, Lee said in response to Emanuel's claims, "Mayor, your honor, you’re gonna be on the wrong side of history."

Not to mention, she's the first individual woman to receive the Sportsperson of the Year honor in more than three decades. Oh and let's not forget she's a superhero, too.
