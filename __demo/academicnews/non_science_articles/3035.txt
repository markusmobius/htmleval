Ready? Okay. This is a clip from a video game called Trap Adventure 2 — which you can download for iOS devices — and it’s designed to drive you crazy. There are so many twists and turns in just that minute and 30 seconds to frustrate the heck out of you.
Watch for yourself:

Maddening! That’s just one part of a longer game. And if you’re like me and got a stomachache just from watching, imagine what it’s like to play.
Somebody actually finished the game, and if you just want to see what it takes to win, go for it:
Here’s the description for the game, which pretty much sums it up:
Caution!! This may be the most hardest, irritating, frustrating game EVER. If you tend to exasperate often, I recommend you not play this game. It will literally drive you insane. I PROMISE. As written above, this game is VERY STRESSFUL. You may get so irritated and frustrated that you throw your phone out the window. I can’t take any responsibilities for the displeasure this game may cause. Even after reading this you are still eager to play the game, then go ahead.
