To our readers: As you can see, our Jan. 5 story about Twitter restoring a suspended account of Ammon Bundy, the Nevada rancher leading a group of armed men occupying federal buildings at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, has been removed. The reporting was based solely on quotes from a Twitter account under Ammon Bundy's name, and posts on the account now claim it was a parody. We wanted to share our decision with you in the interest of transparency. 
Original first paragraph of story: 
The Twitter social media site on Tuesday restored the suspended the account of Ammon Bundy, the Nevada rancher who is leading a group of armed men occupying federal buildings at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.
