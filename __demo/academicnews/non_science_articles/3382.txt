USA TODAY announced today it is a test partner for Facebook’s new storytelling tool for publishers. Beginning tomorrow, USA TODAY will be a way to present packages of Instant Articles together in one post.
“We’re excited about using this new tool to deliver our most engaging stories to more readers in a mobile-friendly way,” said Jamie Mottram, Sr. Director of Social Content & Strategy, USA TODAY NETWORK. “It should help keep people informed and also push USA TODAY to continue having the fastest-growing news presence on Facebook.”
Facebook users on iOS and Android apps will begin seeing this change roll out in the coming weeks.
“The new product elegantly showcases a curated collection of USA TODAY's Instant Articles, and we are thrilled to be an alpha partner for this initiative that presents trusted content in a well-organized and immersive format.” said Kate Walters, Sr. Director of Product Management & Partnerships, USA TODAY NETWORK. “We expect the new experience will help our users, both new and existing, go beyond serendipitously discovering news articles sprinkled throughout their News Feed. We look forward to collaborating with the Facebook Product team to share feedback, track performance, and optimize the experience accordingly.”
