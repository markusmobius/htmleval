MALIBU, CA – JULY 28: Spotify hosts a listening event with Kesha and her fans to celebrate her new album “Rainbow” on July 28, 2017 in Malibu, California. (Photo: Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Spotify)
Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this article included a styling of Kesha’s name that she no longer uses.
When I heard that Kesha was finally releasing new music after a 4-year hiatus, I was immediately transported six years back in time to my first concert ever, on Kesha’s “Get Sleazy” tour of 2011. 
While she was a questionable-at-best role model for my 14-year-old self, I couldn’t be more behind the pop star now after her poise and outspokenness in dealing with one of the most horrific things a woman can face. After a three-year legal battle trapped in an allegedly abusive relationship with her former Sony producer, Dr. Luke, Kesha is finally freed from her contract and is back on the scene with girl-power-filled music. 
She’s channeled that pain beautifully into a new song called Praying — which is well worth the undue four-year wait. And she accompanied it with a lengthy essay about her journey.
Now she’s out with a new release — Woman — that celebrates being a carefree, independent, badass bitch. And I. Love. It.
Seriously, Woman had me strutting down the streets of downtown Los Angeles with an “I dare you to catcall me” look in my eye and an air of confidence in my step.
Proof — this tweet from me mere moments after my catwalk:
 I don't care what anybody says @KeshaRose new song is a BANGER and I feel like a badass when I listen to it. #woman

She said the song was inspired by Donald Trump. 
“I wrote this enraged about Donald Trump’s pussy-grabbing comment,” she explained in her second essay, published by Rolling Stone. “After hearing that I just got in my car screaming ‘I’m a motherf—–g woman!’ out of the window,” she told reporters at an album listening session. 
So especially in the summer, in the streets or at the beach, walking around in shorts and tanks is a no-brainer that can sometimes cause unwanted attention, slutshaming and catcalling. I personally find it empowering to own my outfit and my attitude while bumping music that makes me feel powerful.
We all know the classics — cue Beyonce’s Run the World — here are few more new anthems to strut down the street to this summer and block out the noise.
