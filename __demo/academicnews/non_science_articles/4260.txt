Last year, former model Christie Brinkley reminded everyone that women “do not come with an expiration date” by posing for a saucy photo shoot in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue at the age of 63.
Cindy Crawford, who turns 52 next month, is bringing that same attitude to Super Bowl LII, where she’ll recreate her classic 1992 ad for Pepsi, starring alongside (gulp) her 18-year-old son.
The “This Is the Pepsi” ad is part of a “Pepsi Generation” campaign paying tribute to the company’s 120-year history in pop culture and it will also feature footage of Michael Jackson’s Pepsi commercial. The 1992 ad, in case you’d forgotten, featured Crawford, with huge hair and wearing an undershirt and jean shorts (jorts), pulling into a gas station in a Lamborghini to buy a can of soda. The kicker comes from a young boy who is watching her and says, “Is that a great new Pepsi can or what?” It was an attention-getting ad and changed Crawford’s life, too.
“It was one of those moments in my career that when I walked down the street, people were like, ‘Pepsi!’ Or I’d be at a bar and people would send me over a Pepsi,” she told the Associated Press, “and it’s funny because during Halloween a lot of women will dress up as me in that commercial. It’s like an easy Halloween costume.”
Getting to work with her son Presley Walker Gerber, an aspiring model, was a perk.
“Just as a mother, we drove to work together that day and we shared the same trailer,” she said, “and when he was doing his thing, I was just a proud mom watching from the sidelines, trying not to annoy him.”
