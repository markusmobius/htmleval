In the past two years, Los Angeles went from hosting zero NFL teams to having two in its city. Only, it’s the Rams and Chargers who call L.A. home, not the Raiders.
Don’t tell that to the person who flew this banner over the Coliseum before the Rams’ playoff game against the Falcons, claiming the city belongs to the Raiders and Sean McVay’s squad. Of course, there was a chance the Raiders would move to L.A., but they’re headed to Vegas in a few years.

The Raiders played in Los Angeles for 13 years from 1982-94 before moving back to Oakland in 1995. Clearly, there are still plenty of Raiders fans in L.A.
