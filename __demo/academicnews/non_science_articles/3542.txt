Georgia's HOPE scholarship requirements impact lower-income students
Evans believes young people from lower-income households and less academically accessible areas are the individuals suffering the most from the more rigorous requirements.
“Those are the ones I believe HOPE was intended to help,” says Evans, “Those students who are hardworking, studious and smart.”
Current University of Georgia students are also experiencing the ramifications of the new requirements when their payments are due every semester.
“The HOPE Scholarship pays for part of my tuition,” says junior UGA student Elizabeth Griffith, “It pays for around 78% of my tuition this upcoming year. In past years it paid around 90%, so it’s decreasing.”
Recent graduates of UGA, like Emily Salerno, know the changes influenced their financial situation before they even started college.
“The minute that they changed the law it was too late for me,” says Salerno, “I couldn’t even try to up my GPA. I couldn’t fix the situation. I was just stuck. There was no grandfathering me into the old rules. There wasn’t anything.”
