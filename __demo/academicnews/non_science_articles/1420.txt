ISIS Infiltrates the Rukban Refugee Camp at Jordan-Syria Border 
Some 80,000 people are trapped in a scrub land of hopelessness in a forgotten corner of the Middle East. Huddling in the wind, walled in by desert sandbanks, they have been driven there by war.

NBC News was given unique access to the area — which one Jordanian official described as an 'imminent threat.'
