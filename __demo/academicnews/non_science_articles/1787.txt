Old Forester, the bourbon brand, has introduced a collection of cocktail components meant for the perfect old-fashioned. Jackie Zykan, the company’s master taster, helped create the three kinds of bitters ($11.50 each), in cherry-tobacco, cinnamon-black tea and citrus flavors; two syrups ($8.50 each), Demerara and citrus; and a tincture of smoked sea salt and black pepper ($7.50). All are suited for an old-fashioned or other cocktails. They’re made by Bourbon Barrel Foods, a Louisville company known for its condiments: Old Forester Cocktail Provisions, store.oldforester.com and bourbonbarrelfoods.com.
