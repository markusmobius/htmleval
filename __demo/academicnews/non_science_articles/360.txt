Tiny plastic particles called microbeads have previously been used in the manufacturing of cosmetic products including toothpaste and face exfoliating creams.

The UK government outlawed the manufacture of products containing microbeads on Tuesday in what it says is one of the world's toughest bans on the tiny plastic particles.
The move comes amid a greater public awareness of the build-up of plastics in the world's oceans. Microbeads, which are found in a number of cosmetic products, have prompted their own concerns because of their impact on marine life -- they can enter the food chain for fish and other sea creatures, exposing them to toxic chemicals that can in turn end up on our plates. 
UK Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey called the "world-leading" ban an "important milestone" in a statement.
"Microbeads are entirely unnecessary when there are so many natural alternatives available," Coffey added.
A ban on the sale of products containing microbeads will take effect later this year.
