The first episode of Tom Vs. Time — a new documentary focused on Tom Brady — dropped on Facebook Thursday morning, and it’s a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the New England Patriots megastar QB.
It includes some noteworthy moments: Brady pulling out the letter the NFL sent him last year to inform he was suspended and an intense workout with trainer Alex Guerrero.
And then there’s this intimate moment in which his wife, Gisele Bundchen, tried to cheer up Brady after the Pats’ Week 1 loss to the Chiefs:
