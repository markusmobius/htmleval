An ESPN profile of Chris Borland published on Friday revealed that, during the 2014 NFL Rookie Symposium, a former player told him to get a “fall guy” in case he ever got in trouble with the law.
Naturally, it didn’t take long for the internet to unearth the video, which it found buried in the NFL’s archives. In the video, Hall of Fame wide receiver Cris Carter and defensive tackle Warren Sapp are on stage when Carter talks about the need for a “fall guy”:
“Because all you guys aren’t going to do the right stuff. I need to teach to you how to get around all of this stuff too. If you have a crew, one of them fools need to know that they’re going to jail. I know a lot of you aren’t going to drink, i know a lot of you aren’t going to use drugs but still get yourself a fall guy.”
The NFL, in the aftermath of the video’s unearthing, issued the following statement:
This was an unfortunate and inappropriate comment made by Cris Carter during the 2014 NFC Rookie Symposium. The comment was not representative of the message of the symposium or any other league program. The league’s player engagement staff immediately expressed concern about the comment to Cris. The comment was not repeated in the 2014 AFC session or this year’s symposium.

As Carter’s current employer, ESPN also issued a statement:
 We completely disagree with Cris’s remarks and we have made that extremely clear to him. Those views were entirely his own and do not reflect our company’s point of view in any way. 
Carter also sent out a tweet about the incident.
 Seeing that video has made me realize how wrong I was. I was brought there to educate young people and instead I gave them very…
