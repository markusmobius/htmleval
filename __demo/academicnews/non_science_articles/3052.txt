Second case of racist graffiti in two months appears at Eastern Michigan Univ.
Racially offensive graffiti was found on Eastern Michigan University’s campus. Again.
 There needs to be an e-mail going out about the racist graffiti incident in front of the Science Complex today @EMU_Swoop @GeoffLarcom

This isn’t the first time this has happened this year. Racist graffiti was found at EMU in September too.
 Emu couldn't even handle the first racist graffiti and now it's more?

EMU President Jim Smith says the graffiti “targeting the black community” was spray painted on Ford Hall’s east side exterior, according to a statement USA TODAY College received.
The two-word message, found Halloween morning, told black students to “leave” — using the N-word. It was immediately removed the same morning.
“There is no place on our campus for these kinds of hateful actions and I am deeply angry and saddened that it occurred,” Smith says in the statement. “Our Police officers continue to investigate the incidents in late September.
Eastern Michigan has doubled reward money for information about the September incident from $5,000 to $10,000, the president’s statement says, and the same award is being offered for information in this case.
Smith also says this:
“Again, I am personally angered and saddened, and want to convey my strong sense of resolve in finding out who is behind these incidents and in continuing to come together as a campus community to confront hate and racism, and promote an environment of mutual understanding and inclusion.”
He added, “Our campus community members are strongly encouraged to support our Black students and employees at this time.”
Following the incident, many students took to Twitter to express their irritation regarding the situation.
 If you're not speaking out against the racist Graffiti that happened at EMU, you're complicit in promoting terrorism.

 The building that was vandalized on EMU's campus with racist vitriol is right next to the MLK monument. This is not coincidental. #truEMU

Eastern Michigan set up this resource page to provide information relating to these incidents. 
“The Intersection, a social justice centered lounge for underrepresented students located at 266 Student Center, will be open today for any student who would like to stop in to share their thoughts and concerns,” President Smith told students in his e-mailed statement.
