Happiness Is ... Getting Old?
Advancing years may bring increased contentment. (Susan Farley for The New York Times)
Apparently, some things really do get better with age.
Today’s Washington Post reports on a spate of recent studies that suggest getting older doesn’t just bring aches and pains and health problems. It also brings happiness.
Several studies have produced a stream of evidence that…happens to overturn one of the most stubborn American stereotypes: the belief that this is a land whose gifts, charms and joys flow mostly to young people. The studies show that when you check on how happy people are at various ages, the elderly generally come out ahead.
The report highlights 50,000 detailed interviews with Americans, repeated year after year as part of the General Social Survey, to enable researchers to see how the same people change over time. 
“One important finding was people who were biologically older are happier than younger adults,” said Tom W. Smith, of the University of Chicago and director of the General Social Survey, in an interview with The Post.
The finding wasn’t due to the fact that older people are more stoic or were taught from an early age to be content. The researchers found people older than 65 had not always been happy. It was being older that led to the contentment that many of them felt, The Post reports.
 Dr. Smith found that older people reported a larger number of health problems but tended to report far fewer difficulties overall — fewer financial, interpersonal and crime problems. The younger adults, Smith said, had less trouble with their health but had many more of the other kinds of predicaments, and those, in the long run, tended to trump their better health. 
“It is counter to most people’s expectations,” Dr. Smith said. “People would expect it to be in the opposite direction — you start off by saying older people have illnesses, deaths of spouses — they must be less happy.”
