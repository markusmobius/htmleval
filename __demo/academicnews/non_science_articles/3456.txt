Letter edited for clarify and grammar:
I’m 63-years-old and when I was a kid, there were a few times I encountered the police and highway patrol, back when they still had some discretion. The best example happened when I was a teenager. My friends and I pushed my father’s car up the shoulder of a country road in the middle of the night. A blind man could tell that we were all drunk. The highway patrol officers simply made sure we were all basically OK and then left us alone, figuring that I still had a long painful night ahead, as well as a painful morning explaining this to my dad.
Now things are different.
My son-in-law’s father had several firearms and when he died, he left most of them to a son who shared his interests, including a pristine Smith & Wesson .38 Special. A now-estranged family member reported the weapon, and police came a few weeks later and confiscated it. A couple of months after that, my son-in-law was told he had an outstanding warrant for purchasing an illegal weapon. The police told the prosecutor that this was the wrong charge, but a judge convicted him anyway. In the good old days, a call, maybe a visit, telling my son-in-law to register the gun would have been enough.
My son-in-law is out what little he inherited from his father. He was hit with a hefty fine and court costs as well as a bill for a day in jail.
Police officers look to leaders in the organization for their moral compass. When they don't find it, we shouldn't be surprised by their actions.

Is releasing body camera footage the right thing to do?
