Los Angeles (CNN)
Georgie Smith was working as a designer and chef in Los Angeles when a young man named Barry sought her out.
He was 23 years old and living on his own after growing up in the foster care system.
"I went to see him living in his apartment, amongst black garbage bags," Smith said. "It was unacceptable. ... I immediately thought of my nephew, who was around the same age, and I did what I would do for him."

Los Angeles County has the largest foster youth population in the country. At 18 to 21 years old, they age out of the system, often with no family, financial or community support. And the odds are stacked against them.
Statistics show that many former foster youth will experience homelessness, poverty or incarceration along with higher rates of suicide, teen pregnancy and drug addiction.

"They're out on their own," said Smith, 47. "They finally get to that amazing place of having their own space, and then they're sleeping on the floor."
In 2014, Smith gathered a team of volunteers, collected donated furniture and household items and transformed Barry's makeshift living space into a real home. 
That experience led Smith to start A Sense of Home. The nonprofit has since created comfortable living spaces for 130 young people who have aged out of the system.
"These kids have such resilience and are so inspiring. They are so incredibly positive and hopeful," Smith said. "I just feel it's incumbent on us -- the community -- to be their village."
