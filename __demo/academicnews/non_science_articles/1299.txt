Warning: if you're an engineer, computer or otherwise, this video might make you feel like a superhero.
According to the University of Newcastle, Australia, engineering isn't just simply solving problems. "It's taking crazy, out there ideas and seeing if they're actually possible. And when they are, the idea is shared with the world to make all our lives better." Pretty flattering, right?
The video also asks what problems engineers will solve next and offers a few possibilities, life-saving robots and penthouses views of outer space among them. We're a little just hoping that Flappy Bird makes its way back online, but those are good too.
