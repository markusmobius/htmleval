The Denver Broncos met with Oklahoma State wide receiver James Washington at the Senior Bowl, the NFL draft prospect confirmed to the Denver Post’s Nicki Jhabvala.
Washington (6-0, 205 pounds) is the fourth-best receiver in this year’s NFL draft, according to Draft Wire’s Luke Easterling. The only players ranked higher than Washington are Alabama’s Calvin Ridley, SMU’s Courtland Sutton and Florida State’s Auden Tate.
Washington had great production during his four years at Oklahoma St., catching 226 passes for 4,472 yards and 39 touchdowns, averaging 19.8 yards per reception.
A smooth route-runner with reliable hands, Washington can beat defenses over the top or after the catch, and his solid frame allows him to work through contact and win contested catches. At worst, he’s a high-end No. 2 receiver at the next level, with a limitless ceiling.
Washington is considered a first-round draft prospect but Denver probably wouldn’t select him fifth overall. If the Broncos want to land him they would likely have to trade down or trade back into the first round on April 26.
Washington will play for the South team (coached by the Houston Texans) in the Senior Bowl on Saturday. The Broncos will be coaching the North team.
