USC promotes Bryan Ellis, Keary Colbert as assistant coaches
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Southern California has promoted Bryan Ellis and Keary Colbert to full-time jobs as assistant coaches.
USC coach Clay Helton announced the moves Saturday.
Ellis is the Trojans' new quarterbacks coach, while Colbert will coach their tight ends and inside receivers.
Ellis and Colbert were offensive quality control assistants last season for the defending Pac-12 champion Trojans. Ellis took over temporarily as the quarterbacks coach last month before the Cotton Bowl when Tyson Helton left to become Tennessee's offensive coordinator.
The 29-year-old Ellis was a quarterback at UAB under head coach Neil Callaway, who is now USC's offensive line coach. Ellis was Western Kentucky's passing game coordinator in 2016 before joining USC.
Colbert was a four-year starting receiver for USC, winning a national title in 2003. He played five NFL seasons.
