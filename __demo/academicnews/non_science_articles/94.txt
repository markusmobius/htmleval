Tax law changes: Simple answers to your questions
Yes or No? Simple answers to your tax questions 

Steven Mnuchin: Taxes will go up for the rich
The changes to the new tax law are complex, and difficult even for experts to unpack. But some of the plan's provisions are straightforward enough for simple "yes" or "no" answers.
 1. Does the new bill affect tax rebates available to buyers of electric vehicles? 
 No. Electric car buyers will still be able to seek a tax credit up to $7,500 for plug-in vehicle purchases. 
 2. Are commuter benefits still deductible for employers?  
 No. The new tax bill removes the incentive for employers to offer their workers transportation benefits -- like parking, transit passes, or reimbursements for bicyclists -- by no longer allowing those expenses to be tax deductible. 
 3. Is the tuition waiver still in place for graduate students? 
 Yes. The bill spares graduate students from having to pay income tax on tuition waivers -- something that was proposed in the House version of the bill. 
 4. Do I still get a student loan interest deduction?
