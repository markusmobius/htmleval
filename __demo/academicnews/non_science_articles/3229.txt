Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this report misidentified the name of Cincinnati Reds manager Bryan Price.
Tied 3-3 in the bottom of the 10th inning of Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Reds with the bases loaded, Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Chris Owings belted the ball to deep center field and brought in the winning run.
Owings rounded first but was mobbed by his teammates before he reached second.
While the Diamondbacks were celebrating, the Reds gathered up the ball (a stadium worker tossed it back) and started tagging bases. The Reds aimed to appeal the result, claiming that the Diamondbacks hadn’t properly advanced runners and touched bases and could therefore be called out on force plays.
None of this mattered, though, because there was only one out, and therefore, only the runners headed to first and home had to touch their respective bases– which they did. According to ESPN, even Reds manager Bryan Price knew it:
“We would have had an argument going to either third or second base if there were two outs but because there was only one out that nullified our ability to make that challenge.”
Even if there were two outs in the inning, the Reds still might not have had a case, considering a grounds worker touched the ball.
The umpires talked over the Reds’ would-be double play for a few minutes before allowing the Diamondbacks’ 4-3 win to stand.
