The Cincinnati Bengals entered the 2018 Senior Bowl with the offensive line a major need and wasted little time focusing on Will Hernandez out of UTEP.
Hernandez, a two-time second-team All-American with an impressive resume, comes in at 6-foot-2 and 340 pounds.
Yahoo Sports’ Charles Robinson noted Cincinnati’s obvious interest:
 #SeniorBowl: #Ravens scooped up #Alabama DE Da’Shawn Hand in the hotel and spent quite a bit of time with him today…#Bengals were locked into #UTEP guard Will Hernandez…a LOT of love for UT-San Antonio DE Marcus Davenport…#Redskins clearly QB focused.

Hernandez is a mauler, to say the least, and didn’t have any problems turning some heads during weigh-ins and practices:
 Will Hernandez, G, UTEP: 6’2”, 340
 Scout behind me: “Jesus, that dude’s huge.”

 #UTEP OG Will Hernandez is easy to spot. Just look for the defensive lineman violently moving backwards.

The Bengals could use an early-round guard to help the offensive line get back to quality play under the direction of new coach Frank Pollack.
We don’t know how Pollack will evaluate the current roster or if and where he’ll shuffle around the lineup, but Hernandez is a talent who would start right away after coming off the board in the middle of Round 1 or early Round 2.
While the Bengals have an oft-questioned approach to paying guards, it’s hard to complain about a player like Hernandez when he looks like an instant upgrade.
