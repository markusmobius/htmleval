Everyone's obsessed with b-day boy Ryan Gosling
Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this post listed Gosling's age incorrectly. 
It's rare that we get a glimpse of Ryan Gosling, who keeps an extremely low profile, by Hollywood standards. But, as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder.
So, on this, the day of his 35th birthday, we salute bae with a collection of photographic evidence that proves everyone -- including his fellow celebs -- is obsessed with him.
Even Clooney. No, seriously.
"Aggggggggh - this guy! I mean ... look at this guy! Love you, man."

Saoirse Ronan knows what's up. 

Jane Fonda is not messing around. She obvi loves her some Gosling. 

A wall of screaming photographers can't be wrong. 

Christina Hendricks looks like she's playing it cool, but we know the truth. 

Speaking of redheads, Emma Stone seems stoked to spend some QT with RG. 

This baby's like, "Yasssssss -- hold me, bae." 

Even wax-figure Ryan Gosling gets the VIP treatment. 

And, well, duh. #TeamReva
