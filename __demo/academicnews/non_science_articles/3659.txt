Choice Hotels buys extended stay brand
Choice Hotels International, one of the world’s largest hotel companies, is expanding.
The Rockville, Md.-based company has acquired another brand — WoodSpring Suites.
Choice has paid $231 million for the brand.
The result will be that Choice will add nearly 240 extended stay hotels in 35 states. 
That means that Choice will have an extended stay portfolio of more than 350 properties, including its existing brands — MainStay Suites and Suburban Extended Stay.
“The addition of the WoodSpring Suites brand will allow us to strengthen our scale within the attractive extended-stay segment, expand our runway for growth, and continue to create value for our customers, franchisees and shareholders," says Patrick Pacious, president and CEO of Choice Hotels.
The move follows a trend of hotel company acquisitions. The largest was Marriott International’s purchase of Starwood. But other companies have made similar moves, such as InterContinental Hotels Group buying Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants.
