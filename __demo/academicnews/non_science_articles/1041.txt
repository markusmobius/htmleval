Farrah Abraham Threatens To 'Kill' Everyone On 'Celebrity Big Brother UK'
We're just impressed the word "obliterate" is part of her vocabulary.
Former MTV "Teen Mom" star Farrah Abraham managed to land a gig on yet another reality show -- this time across the pond. The 24-year-old erotic novelist, who has her own sex toy line, is currently a houseguest on "Celebrity Big Brother U.K.," and lets just say it's not going very well because she threatened to "kill" everyone on Monday night's episode.
While it makes for great TV, Abraham's profanity-laced rant during a confessional probably isn't going to help her win. In a room separate from other contestants, she told the camera:
"Oh, because I was going to f**king obliterate the f**king scum that you have in this f**king house. Yeah, and I’m just going to say this; if my f**king flip-flops are not f**king fixed because of your goddamn mouth over the f**king intercom, I am going to straight up f**king kill this whole f**king house!"
The reason for the rant? It doesn't really matter, but if you must know, Abraham blew up after getting into a huge fight with Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton over rationing food.
If you haven't been watching the show, it's good to know that this season pits "celebrities" from the U.K. against "celebrities" from the U.S., with Jenna Jameson, Janice Dickinson and Daniel Baldwin included among Abraham's teammates.
