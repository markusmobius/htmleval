New York City has plenty of hotels, from pods to chains to luxury properties that play host to U.S. presidents and other dignitaries.
Expedia, at USA TODAY’s request, has ranked the top 20 New York City hotels in terms of how high in demand they are.
The most in demand hotel was The Roosevelt Hotel.
Many chains also made the list, such as The Westin New York at Times Square, Doubletree by Hilton Metropolitan, Crowne Plaza Times Square, and Wyndham New Yorker.
Both Pod hotels—Pod 51 and Pod 39—fared well. They provide tiny rooms but interesting public spaces.
Other boutique brands such as Row NYC also ranked highly.
