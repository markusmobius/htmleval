 What is production design?
 This category used to be called "Best Art Direction — Set Decoration," and that second term should tip you off as to what it's recognizing. The Production Design Oscar honors the people who create the sets you see in movies.
 The production designer (or art director) can be better understood as a "set designer" (even if she doesn't always build the actual sets herself), while the set decorator places props and other items upon those sets to make them come to life. (The award goes to both personnel.) Before it was called Art Direction - Set Decoration, in fact, the category was called "Best Interior Decoration," and that's another good hint as to what's being rewarded here.
