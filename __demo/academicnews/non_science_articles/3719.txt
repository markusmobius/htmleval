Even though he played just half the season, Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson was named the All-Rookie quarterback by the Pro Football Writers of America.
Watson was the only Texan to make the all-rookie team on either side of the ball. Houston had the top-scoring offense in the NFL in his six starts. The No. 12 overall pick threw for 19 touchdowns. He also rushed for 269 yards and two touchdowns.
He tore his ACL in practice and missed the second half of the season. Even so, he outshined all the other rookie quarterbacks, notably Chicago’s Mitchell Trubisky.

As a disclaimer, I am a PFWA member and voted for Watson on my ballot. I also voted for Zach Cunningham at linebacker, but he did not garner enough votes to make the team.
