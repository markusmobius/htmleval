 Molly's Game: Aaron Sorkin takes on high-stakes poker in his directorial debut
 "Aaron Sorkin does a poker movie" is so obvious a fit for the West Wing creator's particular talents and obsessions that it’s hard to believe he hasn’t done it before. For Molly’s Game, Sorkin ventures into new territory, on two fronts: He’s written a poker movie, and for the first time, he’s directed it too, with Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba turning in fun, dynamic performances. And the movie makes it pretty clear that gambling on directing his own screenplay is a bet Sorkin ought to take again.
 "At 140 minutes, this movie qualifies as something of an endurance test, crammed to the rafters with voice-over narration, rapid-fire banter and some gratifyingly cogent poker commentary. But as endurance tests go, 'Molly’s Game' is also an incorrigible, unapologetic blast — a dazzling rise-and-fall biopic that races forward, backward and sideways, propelled by long, windy gusts of grade-A Sorkinese." Justin Chang, The Los Angeles Times
