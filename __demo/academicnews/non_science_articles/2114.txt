A gunman in Baton Rouge, La., opened fire, leaving three law enforcement officers dead and at least three others wounded, officials said.
A suspect was killed, most likely by the police. He was identified by officials as Gavin Long, a Marine veteran. Despite earlier reports of other suspects, there was “not an active shooter” situation, officials said.
Tensions have been high in the city since the police shooting of Alton B. Sterling on July 5 led to protests.
