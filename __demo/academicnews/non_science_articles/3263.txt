The 20 best reviewed hotels in Rome
Rome is one of the most popular destinations in Europe, made even more attractive by its proximity to Vatican City, an independent city-state.
Vatican City, though a country on its own, is smaller than Central Park, so many visitors to Rome stay at hotels all around the city.
Rome has other attractions such as the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Roman Forum, Spanish Steps, and Trevi Fountain. 
USA TODAY asked Booking.com, based in Amsterdam, to go through its data to determine the 20 best reviewed hotels in Rome this year.
The city is filled with a number of hotels of various types, from hostels to luxury properties. But the best reviewed hotels on Booking.com are independent properties.
The best-reviewed hotel is Lifestyle Suites Rome, a boutique hotel overlooking Piazza Navona.
Other hotels on the list include Domus Terenzio, in Prati, one of the most exclusive districts in Rome.
Booking.com also pulled its data for the five best-reviewed non-hotels such as apartments and B&Bs.
Take a look at the best-reviewed hotels in Rome in the gallery above.
