Nearly three years into recovery from a decade-long heroin addiction, Ryan Hampton has been rocketed to the center of America’s rising recovery advocacy movement. He is now a prominent, leading face and voice of addiction recovery and is changing the national dialog about addiction through social media. With content that reaches over 1 million people a week, Ryan is breaking down cultural barriers that have kept people suffering in silence and is inspiring a digital revolution of people recovering out loud through his #VoicesProject. He's also advocating for solutions and holding public policy makers accountable. He was part of the core team that released the first-ever U.S. Surgeon General’s report on addiction and was singled out by Forbes as a top social media entrepreneur in the recovery movement. Ryan connects a vast network of people who are passionate about ending the drug epidemic in America. His writing on recovery and addiction related issues regularly go viral in online journals such as HuffPo and The Hill. He also serves as an outreach lead and recovery activist for Facing Addiction, America's leading non-profit dedicated to ending the addiction crisis in the United States. In 2016, Ryan created the web series Facing Addiction Across America, documenting his 30 day, 28 state, 8,000 mile cross-country trip visiting areas hit hardest by the addiction crisis.
