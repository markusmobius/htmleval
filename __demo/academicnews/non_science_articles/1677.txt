Ando, David Chang’s “restaurant without walls,” a meal-delivery enterprise that started two years ago, has closed. The storefront on West 14th Street near Union Square, which opened in the fall and was supposed to enhance the service’s profile, has also closed.
Ando is being absorbed by UberEats, the restaurant delivery app operated by Uber. The ride-hailing service had been doing the deliveries for Ando, so it’s a natural fit.
In a statement, Jason Droege, the vice president of UberEverything, the umbrella under which UberEats operates, said, “We are committed to investing in technology that helps consumers and restaurant partners alike.”
This is not Mr. Chang’s first attempt to create a food delivery service that goes beyond simply picking up pizzas and burgers from a nearby restaurant. He started Maple, to deliver lunches, in the spring of 2015. The service was eventually sold to the London-based company Deliveroo.
Mr. Chang could not be reached for comment. On the Ando website, he thanked all those who supported the company. A spokeswoman for Mr. Chang referred all inquiries to Uber.
