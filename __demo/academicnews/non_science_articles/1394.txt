 Democrat Jon Ossoff Falls Short in Georgia Special Election, Race Goes to Runoff 
Democrat Jon Ossoff won the most votes but failed to reach the needed 50 percent for an outright victory in the closely watched special election in Georgia’s 6th congressional district, according to the Associated Press. The contest will now be decided in a two-candidate runoff between Ossoff and second-place finisher Republican Karen Handel on June 20. The results are a setback to Ossoff’s chances to eventually claim the seat in the longtime GOP district, a disappointment for national Democrats who invested heavily in the race, and a boost for President Donald Trump, who repeatedly attacked Ossoff as too liberal.
