'Pokémon Go' to add more characters
Creators of the hit mobile game Pokémon Go are hoping a new wave of characters will bring more players back.
The Pokémon Company and Niantic Labs revealed it will have more details on December 12 about adding more of the pocket monsters to its game.
The mobile game for Android and iOS surged in popularity over the summer, as players used their smartphones in an augmented reality environment to search for Pokémon in the real world. Players use their phone to track the creatures through a GPS mode, then spot and capture the Pokémon using their camera.
The game set the first-week record for downloads on Apple's App Store. It was also the fastest game to reach 50 million downloads.
Since then, buzz has quickly worn off, prompting Niantic to introduce more characters, and add more features and events such as one for Halloween where players could catch special Pokémon and earn bonus candy, used to make the creatures stronger. The makers of the game are partnering with Sprint on a new campaign where players can earn in-game characters and items by visiting a Sprint store.

It's currently the 10th highest grossing app on Apple's App Store.
