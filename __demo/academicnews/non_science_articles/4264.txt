Maryland gubernatorial candidate Rushern L. Baker III (D) will receive his latest endorsement from his neighboring county executive, former law school dean and longtime friend, Isiah Leggett (D) on Tuesday.
Leggett will endorse Baker, who is in his eighth year as Prince George’s County executive, at Howard University Law School in Washington, where the two first met three decades ago. 
In a news release Monday evening, Leggett, who is serving his last of 12 years as Montgomery County executive, said Baker inherited a county facing rising crime, political scandal, “mired in a foreclosure free-fall” and burdened by the reputation of lagging behind other jurisdictions in Maryland and the Washington region.
“Today, after seven years of his leadership and innovation, property values are on the rise, crime has been cut in half near all-time lows and his county is among the growth leaders in the D.C. Region and the state of Maryland,” Leggett said. 
In the release, Baker said “Dean Leggett” had been a mentor since his first year at Howard. As colleagues overseeing two of Maryland’s most populous jurisdictions, Baker said, he and Leggett had worked together to break ground on the Purple Line and secure more money for school construction. 
The other candidates seeking the Democratic nomination are Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz, former NAACP president Ben Jealous, State Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr., tech entrepreneur Alec Ross, attorney James Shea and Krishanti Vignarajah, a former policy aide to Michelle Obama.
The primary is June 26.
