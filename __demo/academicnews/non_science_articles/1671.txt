Did Jason Kidd’s hunger for more power cost him again?
9 NBA storylines to distract from Warriors' supremacy
Jason Kidd’s hunger for more power may have led to his departure from yet another team.
The Bucks fired Kidd on Monday in the middle of his fourth year as coach, and while general manager Jon Horst cited the need for a “fresh approach,” a new report Tuesday said Kidd wanted more control — the same reason he left the Nets in 2014.
“[Kidd] wanted to do too much personnel decision making and they said Jason, stick to coaching, that’s what you’re here to do,” sources told Sports Illustrated.
The report also said that Kidd’s lack of communication and playing mind games with some players also contributed to his ouster, which the Bucks first began thinking about last summer.
Kidd wanted more authority when he was with the Nets, demanding a role of overseeing their basketball operations department and a title higher than then-general manager Billy King. Denied those wishes after just one season as head coach, Kidd was allowed to seek other opportunities and was soon traded to the Bucks.
Kidd had tried to get ahead of the story Monday, divulging some of his side of the firing to ESPN. He told the network that Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo offered to try to save his job minutes before the team officially swung the ax, but he was too late.
“He called me and said, ‘Coach, this isn’t right what they’re about to do, but [they] are gonna let you go,'” Kidd told ESPN.
Kidd said the only thing Antetokounmpo could do was tell the truth, but the Greek Freak has yet to speak publicly since then.
