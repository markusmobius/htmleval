The fleet and home ports of Norwegian Cruise Line, by the numbers
The 92,250-ton, 2,340-passenger Norwegian Dawn is the newer of Norwegian's two Dawn Class vessels. Unveiled in 2002, it originally was ordered for Asia's Star Cruises and was originally to be called Superstar Scorpio. It sails to the Caribbean, Bermuda, Canada and New England. Michele Verdure
 Dating to 2001, the 91,740-ton, 2,348-passenger Norwegian Star is the older of Norwegian's two Dawn Class vessels. Like Norwegian Dawn, it originally was ordered for Star Cruises. It sails a wide variety of itineraries from the Caribbean to Europe to Asia and Australia. Norwegian Cruise Line
 Built in 1998, the 75,904-ton, 2,018-passenger Norwegian Spirit is the sole member of Norwegian's Spirit Class of ships. Originally built for Asia-based Star Cruises, it sailed in Asia as the Superstar Leo until joining the Norwegian fleet in 2004.

Norwegian Cruise Line is the world's third largest cruise operator in terms of passengers carried per year, accounting for roughly 8% of all cruise vacations worldwide. 
Headquartered in Miami, the company operates 15 large, resort-like vessels with a combined capacity for 46,555 passengers, based on double occupancy per cabin. Competing head-on with mass-market cruise giants Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Princess, Norwegian is a major player in the Caribbean and The Bahamas as well as Europe and Alaska. It also operates a ship year-round in the Hawaiian Islands — something that is unique in the industry. In early 2017, Norwegian also unveiled its first ship custom-built for the Chinese market.
Featuring one of the cruise world's most storied histories, Norwegian is credited with launching the modern cruise industry in the 1960s when it began regular sailings to the Caribbean out of Miami — at the time a novel concept. The line was founded in 1966 by Norwegian-born shipping magnate Knut Kloster and Ted Arison, a cruise industry pioneer who soon would leave to start rival Carnival. Initially called Norwegian Caribbean Line, Norwegian began with just one small, second-hand vessel, the 8,666-ton Sunward, but quickly expanded with additional vessels including, in 1979, the iconic French ocean liner SS France, renamed SS Norway.
While it was eclipsed in size over the years by Carnival and Royal Caribbean, Norwegian would continue to be one of the industry's great innovators, introducing many of the concepts that are now commonplace in cruising. In the 1970s, it developed the industry's first private island in the Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay. In 2000, it blew apart cruising's fixed-seating dining tradition with its eat-when-you-want, with-whom-you-want "freestyle" format, now much copied. It was the first major line to build ships with a wide variety of restaurants instead of a couple main dining rooms.
Like Carnival and Royal Caribbean, Norwegian is now a part of a bigger conglomerate. In 2014, Norwegian purchased the parent company of Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises, which now are operated as sister lines under the umbrella of publicly traded parent company Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH).
