The invention of the marine engine in the late 1800s led to an inevitable conclusion: boat racing. The first known powerboat race was in 1904 on the Hudson River, and you can watch it here. In 1928, the first planing hull was introduced, and the race for speed on the water was officially on.
The history of offshore powerboat racing gets a little racy too, checkered with glitz, glam, colorful characters and shady dealings. One of boat racing’s most intriguing figures is a guy named Don who grew up in Brooklyn, took over the family construction business, made millions and married a supermodel. No, not that Don. This was Don Aronow.
Aronow retired from the construction industry as a wealthy 34-year-old and moved to Miami in search of a new challenge. Speedboats captured his attention, and in 1963, Aronow started Formula Marine on 188th Street in North Miami, launching a line of racing boats.
Formula was the first in a series of boat-building companies he created and sold, turning 188th Street into a thriving speedboat epicenter, now known as Thunderboat Row. Aronow built and raced some of the world’s most famous speedboats, including Donzi, Cigarette and Magnum.
He was a tall, handsome playboy and a bon vivant. As the darling of the speedboat world, he ran with the glitterati and built boats for international figures, including the Shah of Iran and President George H.W. Bush. His racers won hundreds of offshore competitions, and Aronow himself was a two-time world champion.
But the speedboat business had a darker side, a seamy underbelly tied to the illegal drug trade. Aronow’s super-fast boats were a favorite among cocaine runners smuggling pricey cargo through the Bahamas and into Miami, putting Aronow in the company of seedy, ultra-high-stakes players.
On Feb. 3, 1987, Aronow was driving his Mercedes away from a meeting on Thunderboat Row when a powder blue Lincoln pulled up next to him and opened fire, killing him on the street that is a veritable tribute to his life.
For many years, Aronow’s murder remained a mystery. Eventually a drug-trafficking hit man, Robert “Bobby” Young, admitted to pocketing $60,000 to make the hit, a tidy sum offered by Ben Kramer, a rival boat builder, casino owner and convicted drug smuggler.
Although Aronow’s life was cut short, just before his 60th birthday, his legend continues on the water today. Many of the Aronow-era racers are still out there, and the speedboat industry continues to apply the newest materials and technology to craft faster, safer and more comfortable racers that are just as dashing is the classics.
