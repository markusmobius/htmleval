J.D. Power: Enterprise is top-rated rental car company
Travelers have become more satisfied with airport rental car companies, mostly because of lower rates, according to a new study by J.D. Power.
The 2017 North America Rental Car Satisfaction Study found this to be the case despite increases in passenger congestion and logistical challenges caused by airport construction.
“Rental car satisfaction is improving, but it’s not really the type of satisfaction increase rental car companies want to see,” says Michael Taylor, travel practice lead at J.D. Power.
Taylor says that wait times and problems with the pick-up and return processes haven’t improved over the past four years.
“But cheaper daily rental rates overcome those negatives for most renters,” he says.
Enterprise ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction for a fourth consecutive year, with a score of 851 on a 1,000 point scale. It is followed by National (846), Alamo (828), Hertz (822), Avis (818), Budget (809), Dollar (807), and Thrifty (795).
The 2017 North America Rental Car Satisfaction Study is based on responses gathered between September 2016 through August 2017 from 11,177 business and leisure traveler. They rented a vehicle at an airport location from August 2016 through August 2017.
Here are other key findings from the study:
Overall rental car satisfaction improved by 22 index points to 826 in 2017. The average reported daily rental car price has dropped $11 per day this year.
Wait times to pick up a rental car have increased by two minutes since 2013. Of customers who experienced problems, 20% said it was due to the pick-up process and 17% said it was a problem with the return.
Customers often make decisions based on price but those who choose a rental car based on features and benefits report the highest satisfaction scores over those who pick vehicles by price: 889 vs. 787.
Social media makes a difference. Satisfaction scores increase when a rental car company responds to a post—by 63 points on average. If the issue is resolved, satisfaction jumps 95 points.
