Venezuela crisis: EU piles on sanctions as isolation grows
EU heaps sanctions on Venezuela as isolation grows

Venezuela's economy on the brink of collapse
Venezuela's regime is becoming more and more isolated from the world.
 The European Union sanctioned seven Venezuelan leaders on Monday, each of them accused of undermining democracy in one way or another. The EU already banned weapons sales to Venezuela in November. 
 The financial assets of all seven leaders will be frozen in Europe, although it's not clear that they have any. 
 Among the seven are Diosdado Cabello, a congressman who has held high government roles for the last two decades. Cabello is believed to have the ear of President Nicolas Maduro and to be respected by the military. 
 World leaders have condemned Maduro for shredding democracy in Venezuela. Severe shortages of food and medicine have gotten worse and hyperinflation has set in as the government slips further into default and crisis. 
 Isolation couldn't come at a worse time. Venezuela owes $141 billion to bondholders, other nations and a long list of companies, according to Moody's Investor Service. Another estimate published by Harvard Law School puts the figure at $196 billion. Venezuela has less than $10 billion in its central bank reserves, a cushion of cash for dire times.
