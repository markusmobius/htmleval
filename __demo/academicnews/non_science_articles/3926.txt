Lipman Hosts Facebook Live Q&A with Sheryl Sandberg
USA TODAY NETWORK Editor in Chief Joanne Lipman sat down with Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg this past Friday to discuss themes from her new book “Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy.”
 Following the sudden death of her husband Dave, Sandberg penned “Option B” to help others dealing with sudden loss or major life-changing events, with hopes that the book would help to “change how our culture treats grief.”
 ​​​“There’s a huge self-help section in bookstores, but there’s no help others section,” said Sandberg, referencing part of her motivation for writing Option B. With the content and advice in ‘Option B’, “we can take away the isolation and we can support each other at home and in the workplace in ways we couldn’t have before.”
 Sandberg describes the guilt of losing a loved one, and guilt in general, as a huge thief of joy. “We need to give other people permission to feel joy again,” she continues.
 “This is such an important topic for discussion," Lipman said. "Our conversation was a terrific opportunity for the USA TODAY NETWORK audience to connect directly with Sheryl. Audience members provided all of the questions, many of which were deeply personal. Sheryl and I both appreciated their contributions and the stories they shared with us."
