Steelers RB Le'Veon Bell optimistic about contract progress
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Pittsburgh Steelers star running back Le'Veon Bell says he and the team are making progress on a contract extension.
The team has presented an initial offer, and Bell says "we are a lot closer than we were last year."
Bell spoke Wednesday at the Pro Bowl. He says he doesn't believe talks will drag on. He says "I think we'll get something done and it will be exciting for both sides, for the fans and everybody."
The 25-year-old back turned down a long-term contract in 2017, skipped training camp and then signed a one-year, $12 million franchise tender.
The Steelers could franchise him again in March, a move Bell told ESPN would force him to consider retiring or sitting out the 2018 season. A second tag would be worth around $14.5 million.
Bell led the NFL in touches (404) this past season. He insists his preference would be to remain in Pittsburgh.
