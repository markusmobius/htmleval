Gannett announced a new partnership with RealMatch, a leader in online recruitment advertising. RealMatch hosts TheJobNetwork™, a vast national network comprising thousands of local and industry specific job sites. RealMatch has created a proprietary platform that uses predictive data and artificial intelligence to help employers target and recruit the best talent quickly and efficiently.
The partnership will help Gannett grow recruitment advertising business in the highly competitive and rapidly changing online recruitment market. With RealMatch’s performance-based platform, our brands can offer more value to their existing employment advertisers and job seekers, and gain new market share among larger employers seeking enhanced performance-based talent acquisition solutions.
“In the new era of online recruitment, performance and quality determine where recruitment budgets are spent. We welcome Gannett to TheJobNetwork and look forward to bringing the next-generation recruitment advertising solution to its markets to grow their recruitment market share,” said Terry Baker, President, RealMatch.
The combination of RealMatch’s technology and Gannett’s audience data will significantly boost the efforts of our online recruitment advertisers to identify and engage the best job candidates. We will also leverage USA TODAY NETWORK’s vast audience of more than 110 million monthly readers to deploy a new content syndication program to engage job seekers with more relevant career content and drive more interaction on our sites.
“RealMatch’s solutions will offer tremendous opportunities for recruitment advertisers on the USA TODAY NETWORK by connecting them with the talent they seek through our ability to leverage data from our local communities,” said John Zidich, President of Domestic Publishing, Gannett. “Employers and job seekers alike will have an improved user experience with the increased services we are able to provide.”
