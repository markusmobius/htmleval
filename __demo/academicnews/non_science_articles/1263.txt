It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s Justin Trudeau in a Clark Kent costume! 
The Canadian prime minister got into the Halloween spirit on Tuesday and showed up to work at the House of Commons in his costume. Watch him reveal his inner Superman when he reaches the bottom of the stairs:

Trudeau was later spotted wearing the costume while out trick-or-treating with his wife, Sophie, and their three children, Xavier, Ella-Grace and Hadrien, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Justin Trudeau carries his son Hadrien while participating in Halloween festivities at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on Oct. 31.


They must've spotted something spooky.


So cute!
