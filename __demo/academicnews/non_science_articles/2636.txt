Multiple Americans were killed and injured when Taliban militants launched an hours-long attack on a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital over the weekend, according to a media report.
A State Department official told the Associated Press of the U.S. casualties, but did not give exact figures. The official was not authorized to comment by name.
Twenty-two people, including 14 foreigners, were killed when attackers wearing suicide vests stormed the Hotel Intercontinental in Kabul on Saturday night, authorities said. More than 150 people were rescued by authorities or escaped the siege, which ended after a 13-hour gun battle. The Afghan Interior Ministry said the attackers were killed. 
Kabul Balkh Safety and Security Organisation (KBSS), a private security firm, won the contract from the government to guard the hotel three weeks ago, Reuters reported.
The deadly incident has renewed debate about the role of security companies in the conflict-ravaged nation, the news agency said. Former President Hamid Karzai banned private security firms in 2010 amid allegations of crimes including shootings and weapons smuggling. Firms guarding embassies and new developments were later exempted.
A government official involved in the investigation into the hotel attack told Reuters that the 15 guards who were on duty either watched the attack without resisting, or hid. The official refused to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, Reuters reported.
KBSS president Sayed Rahimi expressed his condolences and said it was “too early to come to conclusions as to how this occurred,” Reuters reported.
