Supporters of the Guardian  Members
We want to make the world a better, fairer place. We want to keep the powerful honest. And we believe that quality, independent journalism is essential to protect American democracy. 
 Guardian US operates outside the American media bubble to bring a global perspective to the most pressing issues facing this country. Unlike many news organizations, we haven’t put up a paywall — we want to keep our journalism as open and free as possible. 
 But this is difficult and expensive work. While more people are reading the Guardian than ever before, far fewer are paying for it. And advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. So if you read us, and you value our perspective — then become a Supporter and help make our future more secure.
