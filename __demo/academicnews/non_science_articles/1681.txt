Note: Temperature and precipitation data are from AccuWeather. The normal temperature range is determined using the averages of the highs and lows for each day from 1981 to 2010. 
 Data for some cities is incomplete. For cases in which the actual or historical temperatures were unavailable, the bar is not shown for that day. The data presented here is as it was recorded on Jan. 5, 2018.
