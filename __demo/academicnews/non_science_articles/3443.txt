Brown in rare club as No. 18 Duke women defeat BC 75-50.
DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Lexie Brown tied a school record with 14 points in the first quarter when she joined an exclusive club and finished with 19 points to lead No. 18 Duke to a 75-50 win over Boston College on Thursday night.
Brown had five steals, which made her the third NCAA Division I player with at least 1,800 points, 500 assists, 200 3-pointers and 300 steals, joining Niesa Johnson (Alabama) and Odyssey Sims (Baylor).
Rebecca Greenwell also had 19 points, hitting four 3-pointers, and Leaonna Odom had 12 points for the Blue Devils (16-5, 5-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), who have won 29 straight home games, on shy of the school record.
Brown had all three of her 3-pointers in the first quarter, marking her 20th straight game with a 3, the second longest such streak in program history. It also ties Asia Durr of Louisville for the ACC's longest active streak. Milan Bolden-Morris of Boston College had a 19-game streak as well but missed all four of her 3-point attempts and was held scoreless.
Emma Guy had 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Eagles (6-14, 1-6).
