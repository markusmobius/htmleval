Some stocks to watch this morning, including Southern Union and Gold Resource.
Energy Transfer Equity LP agreed to take over Southern Union in an $8.9 billion deal, topping an offer from rival suitor Williams Cos., and substantially higher than Energy Transfer’s initial offer. Under the revised terms of the deal, Southern Union shareholders will receive $40 in cash or 0.903 Energy Transfer common units for each share. Southern Union’s shares gained 1.6% to $41.01 in premarket trading.
Shares of Gold Resource Corp. slid in premarket trading after Barron’s reported that shares have almost doubled over the past year on a seemingly too-good-to-be-true promise of a “zero-cost” mine that could yield billions. Don’t bet on it, Barron’s says. Shares were off 7.9% to $22.20 premarket.
Immucor has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm TPG Capital for about $1.97 billion, in a deal heralded as an opportunity to expand the blood-test product maker’s global presence. Shares were up 31% at $27.20 in recent premarket trading, above the offer price of $27 a share.
