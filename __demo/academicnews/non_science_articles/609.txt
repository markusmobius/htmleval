The man charged with gunning down an artist as he worked on a mural in Oakland had to be forcibly removed from a courtroom Tuesday after he began shouting expletives at a judge reading a litany of charges against him.
Marquise Holloway, 20, of Oakland was arrested Friday at his mother's home in Stockton on suspicion of second-degree robbery and murder in the killing of Antonio Ramos, who was shot to death Sept. 29 while working on a mural in the under an Interstate 580 overpass, police said.
Police officials described Holloway as a suspected serial robber who set off the deadly confrontation with Ramos, 27, by eyeing the painter's camera equipment to steal.
"F— that! F— that!" Holloway shouted, as he tried to raise his shackled hands and began thrashing about. Court officers quickly pounced on Holloway, struggling with him in the glass-enclosed courtroom dock and dragging him out a door, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
Holloway is known to hang around the same neighborhood of West Oakland where Ramos was killed and had been associated with members of a street gang, Lt. Roland Holmgren said.
Holloway is also believed to be responsible for a string of robberies in the area, including one that occurred in Oakland just prior to Ramos being shot to death, Holmgren said.
Holmgren said that on the day of his death, Ramos had taken a break from painting and was snapping pictures of the mural he was working on when Holloway allegedly walked by and began eyeing some of his camera equipment, which police believe led to the altercation and shooting.
