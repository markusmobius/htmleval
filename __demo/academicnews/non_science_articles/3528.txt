Unexpectedly affordable vacations for 2018

 Hawaii: Low-cost carrier Southwest announced in late 2017 that it will soon begin selling fares to Hawaii, which will likely create competition that will drive down Hawaii flight prices on other airlines as well— a phenomenon known as the Southwest Effect. Few details of Southwest’s planned service have been offered up, but keep an eye out for cheap fares from West Coast hubs as Southwest reveals more information. Getty Images

 Hong Kong: Dreaming of sailboats in Victoria Harbor, but budgeting for an affordable vacation? West Coasters might be able to get there for less than they’d spend flying across the U.S. — Hong Kong Airlines launched flights between L.A. and Hong Kong in late 2017 that have been selling for under $500 round-trip. That’s about $33 for every hour you’ll spend in the air flying there. Yongyuan Dai, Getty Images

 Botswana: Explore the Okavango Delta on a 10-day trip with Intrepid Travel for $1,100, which includes a local guide, transportation, some meals, and experiences at a rhino sanctuary, Chobe National Park (famous for its large population of elephants) and Zimbabwe’s famous Victoria Falls. The trip starts in Johannesburg, where flights to and from the U.S. are a surprisingly affordable travel option: Fares as low as $800 round-trip from hubs like New York and Los Angeles aren’t uncommon in the off-season (December through April).

 Argentina: Airfare to far-off Argentina can be a splurge, especially compared to the rest of South America — but prices on lodging just dropped considerably for one big reason. Argentina’s government recently lifted its hefty VAT (value-added tax) that has long imposed a 21% increase on hotel stays for international visitors. The tourism-friendly change means three and four-star hotels are often priced around $100 per night, so you can consider bucket-list spots like Buenos Aires and Mendoza wine country at 21% off. Argentina’s currency has also swung in Americans’ favor recently: One U.S. dollar is currently worth about 19 Argentine pesos. AdonisVillanueva, Getty Images/iStockphoto

 Turks and Caicos: After hurricanes Harvey and Irma last year, much of the Caribbean will no doubt be looking to rebound through tourism in 2018. Expect lower-than-average hotel prices to entice travelers seeking an affordable vacation: Islands like Grand Turk have recovered completely, so you can feel good about heading to a destination that depends on tourism bouncing back. Round-trip flights are around $350 from northeastern cities like New York and Boston, and $200 from Florida. Best of all, you won’t need to worry about converting your U.S. dollars. eyfoto, Getty Images/iStockphoto

 London: The U.K. has become a far more affordable travel locale in recent years due to largely negative news for England: Brexit led to an economic downturn, and recent high-profile terror attacks have made some tourists think twice about visiting. But, there’s one solidly positive reason for England’s newfound affordability: expanding air routes. The newest carrier to launch London trans-Atlantic service is Primera Air, which now flies from Boston to London and Birmingham for as low as $99 one-way. British Airways also recently launched flights to Nashville – introducing the area’s first non-stop route to England, which opens the door to an affordable vacation across the pond for an entire region of Americans. International low-cost carriers WOW and Norwegian Air offer routes from around the U.S. that continue to cost as little as $69 one-way, and are still expanding. Getty Images/iStockphoto

 Sri Lanka: A surprisingly affordable vacation that’s as dreamy as (and less crowded than) India or Thailand, Sri Lanka’s rapid growth as a tourism destination means its air routes are quickly becoming cheaper while the island’s on-the-ground costs are still ultra-affordable. Flights from the East Coast are as low as $700 round-trip from New York City during monsoon season. Once you arrive, food and accommodation won’t cost you much more. Getty Images/iStockphoto

 Seattle: Sprawling stateside hubs can be surprisingly affordable travel options if you’re willing to take a budget airline and forego your carry-on bag. Spirit Airlines recently launched daily seasonal Seattle flights through Chicago O’Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, Fort Lauderdale and Minneapolis-St. Paul, so the Puget Sound’s parks, seafood and surrounding natural scenery just got a lot closer (and cheaper) for many Americans.
