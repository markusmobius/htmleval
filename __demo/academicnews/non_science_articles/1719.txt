UNEARTHING GAINS
Caterpillar serves up its latest quarterly report card Thursday.
Wall Street predicts the construction equipment manufacturer's earnings and revenue improved in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. That would be in line with the company's performance through the first three quarters of 2017. Caterpillar has benefited from increased demand in North America and China.

LOSING STEAM?
Economists project that the U.S. economy's rate of growth slowed in the last three months of 2017.
They expect the Commerce Department will report on Friday that the gross domestic product grew by 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter. That would be down from the third quarter, when the economy expanded at a 3.2 percent annual rate, and the second quarter, when GDP climbed 3.1 percent.
