What does Tyronn Lue call his boss? “LeBron.”
Alexa is a savage. The personal assistant technology from Amazon is known for having a bit of a personality, but who knew it’d be used to these hot-take ends? Yet here we are, in 2017, when even robots know how to burn the Golden State Warriors.

As shown in that video, all you have to do is trigger Alexa using either the Alexa app or your Echo device, and ask for a Warriors or Cavaliers burn. And man, are they funny:
Alexa, give me a Warriors burn.
Why did the Warriors lose the championship last year? Their attitude was too cavalier.
Alexa, give me a Cleveland Cavaliers burn.
Why is Kyrie Irving missing his jumpers? He believes his shot is flat.
More because we’re not tired of this yet, via Twitter user @Ty_Bama2002:
• “A doctor offered the Warriors a miracle drug that would make them 3 feet 1 inches taller, but they declined. They have a bad history when they’re up 3-1.”
• “What did Steph Curry learn in grade school? If at first you don’t succeed, stack your team, and try try again.”
• “How do you spell ‘cupcake’ with only two letters? KD.”
Yes, this is making me want to drop $50 on an Echo Dot. Which, of course, is the point.
No word on whether there are any Rihanna-related jokes.
