It was a week of upsets across the D.C. area, as seven Top 20 teams lost at least one game. 
In the WCAC, two scoring performances highlighted the wild stretch. First it was McNamara’s Jakia Brown-Turner against Monsignor Scanlan from New York on Sunday. With scoring point guard Aliyah Matharu knocked out by an injury, coach Frank Oliver needed his star junior to carry the scoring load. She did so, to the tune of 45 points. Brown-Turner had five three-pointers, made eight of her nine free throws and even chipped in seven rebounds. 
On Friday, St. John’s freshman Azzi Fudd had a big night of her own. In a 72-51 win over Good Counsel, Fudd scored 41 points including six threes. It’s just the latest eye-popping stat line in what has been a sensational season for the young guard.
