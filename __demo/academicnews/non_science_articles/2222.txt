It’s no challenge to find Manchego, the popular Spanish cheese. But Mahón has only recently become widely available in the United States. The pale yellow cheese, from the island of Minorca, is versatile. Typically a squarish loaf, it is buttery mild with a fruity aroma after three months of aging. Paprika gives the rind its bright orange hue. At six months, the rind darkens to brown, the texture firms up and the cheese becomes more robust. There is another six-month-old version, made from raw milk, with a more intensely fruity flavor. All are excellent melters: Mahón, Whole Foods and Gourmet Garage stores, $16 to $24 per pound, depending on the variety and the store.
