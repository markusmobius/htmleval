An Expectant Mother - NBC News
Um Mohammed is seven months pregnant. She has not seen a doctor in three months – the hospital is too far and she doesn’t have money for transportation. 
 “I will provide what I can for him, but he will be born here,” she said. “What more can I give him?” 
 She and her children fled their village in the outskirts of Hama 14 months ago after a barrel bomb struck her next door neighbor’s house and killed the entire family. 
 She lives with her brother and her two young children, Samira, 4 and Mohammed 2. Her husband is a rebel fighter with the Free Syrian Army.
