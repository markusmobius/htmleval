Oregon assistant football coach David Reaves has been placed on administrative leave after an arrested early Sunday for suspicion of DUI.
A statement, which came from athletics director Rob Mullens, said the university has begun the process to fire Reaves, 38. The official charge in Oregon is DUII — driving under the influence of intoxicants.

Reaves — hired last week to be co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks and tight ends coach — served as Taggart’s associate head coach and tight ends coach at South Florida. He also coached quarterbacks, wide receivers and was offensive coordinator during his time at South Florida. He also has experience as an assistant at New Mexico, Tennessee and South Carolina.
This incident was just the latest in a difficult week for Oregon and new head coach Willie Taggart. The Ducks suspended football strength and conditioning coach Irele Oderinde on Tuesday after three players were injured during offseason workouts and hospitalized. All three have been released. Taggart, who had just completed putting together his staff, issued an apology for that incident.
