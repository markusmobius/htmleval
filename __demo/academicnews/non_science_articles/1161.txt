Arianna And Diane Sawyer Discuss Saving the Middle Class: 'Democracy Is Not A Spectator Sport'
640 
Arianna joined ABC "World News" host Diane Sawyer in an interview airing Tuesday night to discuss the ongoing struggles of the middle class, which is under assault in a variety of ways detailed in Arianna's new book, Third World America.
"We need to help people in the middle class who are losing their homes," Arianna said. "The truth is that democracy is not a spectator sport."
Arianna rejected the notion that the solution would come from the political class, calling instead on ordinary citizens to help save their communities, like some of the people profiled in Third World America.
"When people take action, it's the greatest antidote to despair," she said. "It's always been about people in their own communities taking matters into their own hands, and both changing things and demanding change from our elected leaders."
