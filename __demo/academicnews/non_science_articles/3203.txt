The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series announced Monday the start times and TV and radio networks for the 2018 season.
Unlike 2017, no race will start before 2 p.m. ET next season, though a number of races that had later start times this year will see a slightly earlier start. 
Pocono Raceway and Michigan International Speedway had 3 p.m. ET start times for both races this season, but in 2018, their first race will start at 2 and their second at 2:30. Similarly, races at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Watkins Glen International and Indianapolis Motor Speedway will also see slightly earlier start times next season.
Some alterations to the calendar were announced earlier this year. New Hampshire will host only one race in 2018 as Las Vegas Motor Speedway picks up an additional race instead. The second Las Vegas race will kick off the 2018 playoffs on Sept. 16.
The second race at Richmond Raceway, which had traditonally been the final regular-season race, now becomes the second race of the playoffs and will be the only night race in the 10-race postseason.
Charlotte Motor Speedway, which will hold its playoff race on a combination of the track's oval and road course, becomes the first elimination race of the playoffs, while the second Dover International Speedway date becomes the second-round opener.
