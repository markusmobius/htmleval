The word amble has appeared in 16 articles on nytimes.com in the past year, including on Nov. 1 in “Manhattan Terror Attack Exposes Bike Path’s Vulnerable Crossings” by Sharon Otterman:
The four-mile-long Hudson River Park Bikeway, which hugs the West Side Highway on the western side of Manhattan, is the busiest bike path in the city, with some 6,000 cyclists using it each day. The downtown section, where Tuesday’s attack took place, was completed by the early 2000s, before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Since its opening, it has been a magnet for tourists and locals alike.
Through the year, clusters of tourists pedal leisurely down the path taking in the view of the Hudson River and the Jersey City skyline. Serious cyclists speed by. Parents amble by with strollers. Children whiz by on scooters as they move between the playgrounds of Hudson River Park.
