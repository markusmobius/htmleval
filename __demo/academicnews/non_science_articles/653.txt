What a difference a year makes.

It’s plane crazy: A flight that took off in 2018 ended up landing in 2017.
Hawaiian Airlines Flight 446 was scheduled to depart Auckland, New Zealand, on Dec. 31 at 11:55 p.m. local time on its way to Honolulu.
However, an unexpected 10-minute delay meant that it took off at 12:05 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2018.
Thanks to the location of the international date line, Honolulu is 23 hours behind Auckland. That meant the eight-hour flight landed at 10:16 a.m. on Dec. 31, 2017.
Sam Sweeney, a transportation reporter for Washington, D.C., station WJLA, noticed the quirky flight time and posted it on Twitter ...

Some people weren’t sure how to react.

Others felt it was a good opportunity for a “Doctor Who” gif.

And at least one person wanted to kill the buzz by bringing, ugh, a rational explanation.
That happens every time a plane crosses the current midnight line - think of it as the border between the kingdoms of 2017 and 2018 - in the wrong direction on New Year’s. In other words, it happens a lot. Still seems to surprise a lot of people every year.
