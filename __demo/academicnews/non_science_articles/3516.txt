House passes bill to give Olympic medalists a tax break
For some Olympic and Paralympic athletes who have returned from Rio, a tax break will likely be coming for those who won medals this summer.
The House passed a bill Thursday to eliminate the tax penalties on “prize money received from the United States Olympic Committee on account of, competition in the Olympic Games or Paralympic Games.” The bill retroactively applies to athletes who won medals at the Olympics and Paralympics, which ended this month.
The tax exemption does not apply to athletes with an adjusted gross income that exceeds $1 million.
Rep. Robert Dold (R-Ill.) sponsored the bill, which passed 415 to 1.

"Our Olympic and Paralympic athletes make numerous personal sacrifices while training to represent the United States on the global stage, and they often get little or no financial help for their training," Dold said in a news release. "The vast majority of Olympic and Paralympic athletes will never sign an endorsement deal or get paid millions of dollars to compete – they're school teachers, full–time students, retail workers and more. But when they return home with a medal for Team USA, the IRS forces our Olympic and Paralympic champions to pay a penalty for their success. Our bipartisan bill ensures that these athletes can remain focused on fulfilling their Olympic and Paralympic dreams without the fear of getting a huge tax bill in the mail."
A similar bill passed in the Senate in July. President Obama is expected to sign the bill into law.
The USOC awards $25,000 for Olympic gold, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze.
