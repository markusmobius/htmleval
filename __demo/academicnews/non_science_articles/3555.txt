Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story misidentified Jenner.
Remember Justin Bieber's 2010 hit Baby? You know, the catchy tune he sang with his flipped hair, and Ludacris?
Well, supermodels/best friends Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner were asked to perform the song for W, the magazine which recently featured the two on the cover.
"You guys, this is scary," Hadid says.
Despite her fears, Hadid doesn't hold back, and belts the song. It actually sounds really good. Meanwhile, Jenner takes a more serious approach to her interpretation of the tune, going with a spoken-word technique.
It's all to please editor-at-large Lynn Hirschberg, and you, Internet.
