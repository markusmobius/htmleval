Hillary Clinton continues to hold a slim lead in the popular vote over Donald Trump, but he is the president-elect because of his decisive lead in the winner-take-all Electoral College.
Many have pointed to an old tweet Trump in which he called the Electoral College a "disaster for a democracy," a sentiment he doesn't likely feel after Tuesday's election result. He sent the tweet on election night in 2012, but it's unclear what motivated him since President Obama won both the popular vote and the Electoral College.
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.

As of 9:19 p.m. ET, Clinton had 59,888,392 votes to Trump's 59,668,718, a lead of 330,674 votes. Of course, a victory in the popular vote is ultimately academic. It is the Electoral College that determines the winner of the presidential election, regardless of the total national votes for each candidate.
It appears Trump will become the fifth person to become president without winning the popular vote, the most recent being George W. Bush in 2000. That result would also mean that George W. Bush in 2004 continues to be the only Republican candidate to win the popular vote since 1988.
