HIGHLAND HEIGHTS, Ky. (AP) — Gary Clark had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Jarron Cumberland scored 11 of his 13 in the first half to help No. 9 Cincinnati extend the nation's longest active home winning streak with a 75-42 victory over Temple on Wednesday night.
Kyle Washington had 13 points and nine rebounds for the Bearcats (17-2, 7-0 American Athletic Conference), who won their 11th consecutive game and 37th straight at home while completing a regular-season sweep of the Owls.

The Bearcats won the first meeting 55-53 on Jacob Evans III's jumper with a second left on Jan. 4 in Philadelphia. This one wasn't even close.
The Owls scored the first five points of the game, then went scoreless for nearly five minutes. It was one of two Temple scoring droughts that approached five minutes in the first half.
The Bearcats had runs of 7-0 and 10-0 and led 35-19 at halftime.
