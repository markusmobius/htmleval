Cunningham scores 22, No. 11 Missouri women beat Arkansas
COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Sophie Cunningham scored 22 points to lead five Missouri players in double figures and the No. 11 Tigers beat Arkansas 88-54 on Sunday.
Kayla Michael and Lauren Aldridge had 13 points apiece, while Jordan Chavis and Jordan Frericks each scored 12, for Missouri (17-2, 5-1 SEC).
Michael and Aldridge each hit 3-pointers as the Tigers took an 8-0 lead fewer than two minutes in and Amber Smith made a 3 and then a short jumper to cap a 9-0 run that made it 27-11 late in the first quarter. Kiara Williams made jumpers to close the first and open the second quarters that pulled Arkansas within 10 points, but Aldridge answered with a 3-pointer before Cunningham scored six points to make it 37-18 with seven minutes left in the half and Missouri led by at least 15 points the rest of the way.
Williams and Jailyn Mason led Arkansas (11-9, 2-5) with 14 points apiece. Malica Monk added 11 points.
Missouri outscored the Razorbacks 21-2 from the free-throw line and shot 52 percent from the field (27 of 52) and from 3-point range (13 of 25).
