The general consensus about Baker Mayfield in the NFL Draft is that the Oklahoma quarterback and Heisman Trophy is not going to be the No. 1 pick. Depending on who you ask, he’s might not even be considered the top quarterback.
Still – despite those who question how his height could hold him back on the field (he’s 6-foot-1) or his character off it – it’s possible that Mayfield could be drafted No. 1 by the Cleveland Browns, who, of course, are coming off a dismal 0-16 season.
Mayfield loves the underdog mentality, especially considering he went from an Oklahoma walk-on to a Heisman winner. In an interview Wednesday with 92.3 The Fan in Cleveland, he said no matter what anyone thinks, he’s going to revive the franchise if the team drafts him.
At the end of the interview when asked what the Browns would get if they draft Mayfield, he said, via 92.3 The Fan:
“They’re getting a winner. They’re getting somebody that’s gonna turn that franchise around. They’re getting somebody that no matter what happens, no matter what anybody else on the outside thinks of that franchise, I’m gonna put belief and I’m gonna put new life into that. And I’ll do everything I can to win and everything for my team and the coaching staff. They’re gonna get the biggest competitor they’ve ever seen. That’s what I brought to OU, and that’s always been what I believe in.”
Mayfield is set to play in the Senior Bowl on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. ET.
