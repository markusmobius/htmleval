It’s yet another mass shooting, in a country that has had more than 1,500 since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. The US has six times as many gun homicides as Canada and nearly 16 times as many as Germany. US citizens also own almost half of the world’s civilian-owned guns. [Vox / German Lopez]
A volcano in Japan sets off a deadly avalanche
The sudden eruption of Mount Kusasu-Shirante in central Japan triggered an avalanche and rained ash on the slopes of a nearby ski resort Tuesday, leaving a trail of chaos in its wake. [Japan Times]
The eruption is responsible for the death of at least one person: a soldier who was training nearby. Several other soldiers were taken to the hospital to be treated for injuries. Meanwhile, 10 people were hit by rocks at the ski resort, which injured five seriously. Five others were hurt by debris that smashed the windows of a gondola. [NYT / Austin Ramzy]
Japan sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and has 111 active volcanoes, as well as frequent earthquakes. The country’s Meteorological Agency raised the volcanic alert level from 1 to 3 after the most recent eruption, warning people not to come within a one-mile radius of the crater in the case of another eruption.
