Special Trip for Hair Clips
Dear Diary:
My favorite hair clip broke, so I made a special trip from Brooklyn to Clyde’s Pharmacy on the Upper East Side.
Imagine my dismay when I arrived to find a “going out of business” sign in the window. I rushed inside, hoping that I had arrived just in time.
The rack of hair clips had been cleaned out. There were only a few girlie bows hanging on it. I glanced around. Most of the shelves had been picked bare. Weary sales assistants were being asked about items that were now long gone.
A middle-age woman with smooth skin approached the hair clip rack, sales clerk in tow.
“I don’t see any claw clips,” the woman said. “The French ones.”

“Finished,” the clerk said, and then retreated.
I turned to the woman.
“I was looking for one, too,” I said.
