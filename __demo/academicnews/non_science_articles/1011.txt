Tweeters Convinced Trump Is A Huge 'Power Rangers' Fan
"IT'S MORPHIN' TIME!"
Go, go Donald Trump!
Tweeters gleefully mocked the president on Wednesday over his choice of words while discussing an immigration plan to deal with young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.
BREAKING: Trump says immigration plan will let protections for younger immigrants "morph into" citizenship in 10-12 years.

Trump suggested that the plan would allow protections for “Dreamers” to “morph into” citizenship “over a period of 10 to 12 years.” Those comments sparked suggestions that Trump had been watching the “Power Rangers” superhero franchise. Perhaps during his executive time?:
I guess the DREAMers are becoming Power Rangers https://t.co/G6dql9Qhgu

So he's killing #DACA in favor of the #Transformers plan. Got it. https://t.co/m7pYi9Bh8X

President Trump stated that Dreamers can "morph into" citizens. Did he watch a few episodes of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers earlier this week? It's morphin time then.

This is highly technical legal terminology. https://t.co/id2h3PiOTz

It’s as likely as Trump will morph into having actual human compassion

I'm sorry. Are #Dreamers the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers now? Are they going to form some powerful droid? WTF? #DACA 🤔 https://t.co/cQ90FEDfSu

Like how @realDonaldTrump was expected to "morph into" a President? https://t.co/5yLFSX3t1v

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse 
Serious questions. 
1. Does Trump know that "dreamers" = DACA? 
2. "Morph into"? Is Trump and Stephen Miller Power Rangers fans?

“Trump says Dreamers might eventually 'morph into' US citizens”
integrate is a much better word choice sounds like power rangershttps://t.co/icl6EghSfC

Interesting how ‘amnesty’ morphed into ‘morph into’.
