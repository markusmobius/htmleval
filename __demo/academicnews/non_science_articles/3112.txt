STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) — Bridget Carleton scored a career-high 39 points — the most by a Big 12 player this season — including 13 in the fourth quarter when Iowa State rallied to defeat No. 19 Oklahoma State 78-69 on Wednesday night.
The Cyclones (9-11, 3-6 Big 12) made 13 of 18 free throws in the fourth quarter, 12 of the makes coming in the last 1½ minutes.
Carleton's 3-point play with 5:10 remaining gave Iowa State its first lead, 60-58. Adriana Camber hit a 3 with 4:11 left to put the Cyclones ahead for good at 63-60 and Carleton's 3 at 2:56 — their last field goal — made it a two-possession game and started a 7-0 run.
The Cowgirls (14-5, 5-3), who were 11-0 at home, were 4-of-22 shooting in the fourth quarter, including 2 of 12 from 3-point range. Loryn Goodwin scored 30 points, making 14 of 16 free throws, and Kaylee Jensen had 12 points and 14 rebounds.
