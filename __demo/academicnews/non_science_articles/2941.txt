After two hung juries, voluntary manslaughter and murder charges were dismissed in the police shooting of unarmed black motorist Samuel DuBose in Cincinnati. Comments are edited for clarity and grammar:
Will racists call this an injustice, letting the white cop Ray Tensing go free without a single charge? I don’t think so. Their modus operandi is endless excuses on why the shooting was justified.
Nevertheless, they want the full extent of the law to fall on a black cop for shooting a white woman in Minneapolis.

Now we see, ironically, especially in this case, that courts are also places of INJUSTICE, too .Ah, the glory that was the USA.🇺🇸🇺🇸

“White cop shoots black man.” “Jury divided along racial lines.” I find it interesting that the Black Lives Matter movement always believes the black person was innocent, yet none of them was there when the incident happened.
As we have seen many times, videos seldom tell the whole story. I don’t think anyone will disagree with the idea that there are bad cops of both races, but rushing to judgment based on what folks think they see in a video or photograph is irresponsible.

So much for the charade of justice being “color blind” in America. This is an ideal verbalized by those who wish that it were so but are not willing to acknowledge the reality of American “justice” and the justice inequity going on in our country, which dates back to the days of slavery.

Of course, race always plays a part in cop trials, and they are never found guilty.

It seems obvious that there was not enough evidence to convict Tensing, regardless of people’s social justice conviction. If we are not going to honor the juries’ decisions, then we are in deep trouble moving forward — and we may as well not have trials and juries. Isn’t the whole point to have neutral parties listen to the evidence presented and make a decision? We don’t get to say they are wrong. We were not part of the trial with access to the actual facts.
