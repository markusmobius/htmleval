A manhunt is underway after a sheriff’s deputy was shot and killed in Colorado.
The Adams County Sheriff's Office said its deputies were responding to a report of an assault on Dawson Street in Thornton — about 8 miles north of downtown Denver — shortly before 7 p.m. Wednesday. The suspect fled and a man matching his description ran behind a house before pulling out a handgun and shooting at the deputies, hitting one in the chest, the sheriff's office said.
The deputy was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The Colorado Fraternal Order of Police, a law enforcement union, named him as Heath Gumm, 32, KUSA reported.
One suspect was taken into in custody late Wednesday, according to KUSA.
Police said they were looking for two other suspects who witnesses described as light-skinned black or dark-skinned Hispanic males wearing black.
“The entire Sheriff’s Office is praying for the wife and family of our fallen deputy. Please continue to keep them in your thoughts and prayers as this is a very difficult time for everyone," Adams County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.
