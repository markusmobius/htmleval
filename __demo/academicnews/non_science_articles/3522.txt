Manny Pacquiao is holding an open media workout at Wild Card Gym in Los Angeles Wednesday, and he’s got a new piece of workout equipment to show off: a speed bag featuring Floyd Mayweather’s face. Pacquiao received the bag as a gift from attorney Robert Shapiro, who successfully defended O.J. Simpson in 1995.

Pacquiao’s list of supporters keeps on growing as we near May 2nd. The fighter spent time with Tim Tebow last month, and was visited by UFC women’s champion Ronda Rousey and Jeremy Lin.
