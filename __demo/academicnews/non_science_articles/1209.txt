White Model Apologizes After Her Photo Shows Up On Blackhair Magazine
"I'm very sorry this cover was taken away from a black woman," she wrote.
Blackhair magazine had some explaining to do after mistakenly featuring a white model rocking afro-textured hair on the cover of its latest issue. The publication, known for offering hair tips and tricks for black and mixed-race women, was called out by a white model Emily Bador who says an old modeling photo of her was used without her permission for the December/January issue of the mag. 
In an Instagram post published on Sunday, Bador shared a photo of the cover, writing in a caption that she “deeply and sincerely” apologized for the picture. Bador explained to her over 64,000 followers that the image had been taken three or four years ago when she was around 15 years old, before she had learned about the concept of cultural appropriation and the stigma many black women receive for wearing their hair in its natural state. 
“I hold up my hands,” Bador wrote. “I’m so so so sorry and I’m very sorry this cover was taken away from a black woman.”
