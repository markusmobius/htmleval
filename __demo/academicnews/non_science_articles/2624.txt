Is it worth hiking? Exercise review

What is it? Just a nice long walk.
How much does it cost? Probably an initial outlay of about £50 for some decent gear, and then free for ever.
What does it promise? Improved cardiorespiratory fitness, improved muscular fitness, weight control, better balance and – according to the president of the American Hiking Society – reduced stress and anxiety.
What’s it actually like? Are you kidding? The hit of fresh air in your nostrils? The beauty of the countryside? The clearness of mind that comes from ditching everything and setting off into the great unknown? Hiking is amazing. You might not want to go all in straight away – this month’s Caledonian Challenge, for example, is a hilly 54-mile slog that only the fittest walkers should attempt – but the beauty of hiking is that there’s nothing stopping you from picking a route that fits your ability. Start by consulting the National Trails website – which has distance and gradient calculators – pick your trail and away you go. It’s a steady but comprehensive workout; the perfect antidote to the veiny, bulge-eyed intensity of something like CrossFit. There’s nothing quite as satisfying as breathlessly exploring the countryside by yourself. If you happen to see me out on the North Downs Way this summer, do say hi.
