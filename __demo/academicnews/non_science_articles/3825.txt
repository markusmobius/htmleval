Isaiah Thomas did some damage control on Wednesday. The drama of Keeping Up With The Kavs isn't slowing down anytime soon. But Thomas appears to be trying to make up for his part in the Cavs emotional team meeting that resulted in an airing of the grievances.
After reports surfaced that he led the backlash against Kevin Love over getting sick, Isaiah Thomas took to twitter to congratulate his teammate for making the 2018 NBA All-Star Game.
Congrats to my guy @kevinlove on making the all star team! Well deserved my brotha…

Shortly after Thomas' tweet, Love responded positively.
Appreciate it brother https://t.co/KHEZkiITAo

Even when they're playing poorly, the Cavs are never boring.
