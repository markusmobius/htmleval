House Judiciary Chair on Missing FBI Texts: 'We Should Search Every Place to Find Them'

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said the federal government should search "every place" they can to recover the missing months worth of texts between FBI Agent Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. "I believe they still exist in some form somewhere," he said. "We should search every place to find them." Goodlatte, of Roanoke, said that even the texts Congress has in their possession are "alarming." He specifically pointed to mentions of a "secret society" and "insurance policy" against President Donald Trump's election. He said the people involved in the texts are "hostile to the president [and have] not been conducting themselves in a manner that befits the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
