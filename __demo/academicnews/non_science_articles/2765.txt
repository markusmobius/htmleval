Kristaps Porzingis shoves Marquese Chriss in Knicks-Suns scuffle
Knicks unicorn Kristaps Porzingis and Suns rookie Marquese Chriss got into a scuffle in the third quarter on Tuesday night.
After Porzingis blocked Chriss' shot, the two were running down the court and Chriss shoved Porzingis to the ground. KP then popped back up to give Chriss a good shove as Knicks players quickly ran over to stick up for their teammate and separate the two.

A couple of the beat writers at the game noted that this was the angriest they have ever seen 21-year-old Porzingis.
Never seen KP6 get that angry after he tripped over Bledsoe then got thrown down by the rookie Chriss. Play under review.

Kristaps Porzingis as angry as we've seen him. Got up and pushed rookie Marquese Chriss after he was knocked down by Suns forward.
