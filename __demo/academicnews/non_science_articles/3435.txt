Italian cyclist Ruffoni banned for 4 years for doping
AIGLE, Switzerland (AP) — The International Cycling Union says it has banned Italian cyclist Nicola Ruffoni for four years for doping.
Ruffoni's positive test for a growth hormone-releasing peptide during training was announced on the eve of the Giro d'Italia in May.
The 26-year-old rider and teammate Stefano Pirazzi, who also tested positive for a GHRP, were fired by Italian team Bardiani CSF.
The UCI previously banned Pirazzi for four years.
