 What is film editing?
 This one is simple — the film editor takes all of the footage shot and assembles it into the movie you see. He determines the rhythm of individual scenes, decides when you see certain camera angles, and makes the call on what stays in or gets cut.
 Like the cinematographer, the film editor also works closely with the director, but instead of doing so on set (as the cinematographer does), he or is present throughout the post-production process. Many directors with long-trusted editors — like, say, Martin Scorsese and editor Thelma Schoonmaker — will have those editors assembling footage into rough cuts even while filming continues.
 Ultimately, the decision of final cut rests with the director or studio executives (usually the latter), but the editor is the person with the technical know-how to make that final cut happen. And he often has ideas of his own to contribute to this process.
