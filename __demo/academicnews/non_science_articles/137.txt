Why you probably won't pay the AMT again
Normally the very highest income households don't get to take advantage of the exemption levels, at least not in full. But the new law greatly expands how many of them can. 
 2. Higher exemption phaseout levels 
 The tax overhaul increases the exemption phaseout level -- which is the income level above which you gradually lose your income exemption, until it disappears completely. The phaseout levels were raised to $1 million for joint filers, up from $160,900; and to $500,000 for individuals, up from $120,700. 
 So a lot of households making between $200,000 and $1 million will now get to take full advantage of the exemption levels, whereas before they could not. 
 3. Fewer tax breaks under the regular tax code 
 The AMT is usually triggered for filers when they claim a lot of exemptions, credits and deductions that are aren't allowed under AMT rules. 
 But the new tax law eliminates a lot of those breaks, such as personal exemptions, and it has limited the value of others, such as the state and local tax deduction, said Joe Rosenberg, a senior research associate at The Tax Policy Center. 
 The estimated 200,000 filers who will remain in the AMT's crosshairs are likely to be very high-income households that claim large, less-than-typical tax breaks such as tax-exempt interest on private activity bonds, Rosenberg said. 
 Even though most filers who have been subject to the AMT in the past will not be subject to it again over the next eight years, the mere fact that it remains on the books means millions of filers will still need to calculate their tax liability twice. 
 So much for the oft-promised "simplification" that the new tax law would provide.
