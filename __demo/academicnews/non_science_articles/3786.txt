'Wild Thoughts' is the Rihanna/DJ Khaled track we've been waiting for

Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story misidentified the artist of Mike Will Made-It's 'Nothing is Promised.'
As heard on Calvin Harris' megahit This is What You Came For, to Mike Will Made-It's underrated Nothing is Promised, there's no easier way for a producer to improve a track than to add Rihanna. Same goes for DJ Khaled, whose new track Wild Thoughts is a showcase for Rihanna's talents.
Co-written by PARTYNEXTDOOR and featuring a verse from Bryson Tiller, Wild Thoughts samples Santana's Maria Maria guitar riff on its chorus, but spiritually, the track is closer to Destiny's Child's Independent Women, Pt. I, giving fans the closest thing to a Rihanna/Beyonce collaboration. And, unlike the hilariously bad music video for Khaled's I'm The One, the visuals for Bad Thoughts are iconic, a moodboard for summer 2017 that has us re-evaluating how we're using our desk fans.
Along with previous singles Shining, I'm the One and To the Max, Bad Thoughts will appear on Khaled's new album Grateful, out next Friday.
