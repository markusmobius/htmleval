Behold the mystical power of 'Green Lantern' - USATODAY.com
LOS ANGELES — Ryan Reynolds isn't much of a comic-book nerd, but even he picked up on signals that the superhero war was heating up on the big screen.

He was at a 7-Eleven when he noticed a kid, maybe 10, standing in front of him. The boy was buying a peanut butter cup wrapped in an image of Reynolds, the actor decked in a sinewy green get-up and pointing at patrons, imploring them to see Green Lantern. And buy the peanut butter cup.
"It can be pretty surreal, seeing yourself on a Slurpee or candy," Reynolds says. "You know things are getting big when a kid rips off your face and starts eating."
Whether kids rip ticket stubs and start watching Lantern, which opens today, is a bigger question for the DC Comics intergalactic cop, who turns 71 next month. While summer has been rife with comic icons, including Thor and X-Men, no comic-book movie marks a bigger gamble this year than the emerald ring bearer.
For years considered too spacey on the narrative front and unachievable on the technical front, Lantern arrives amid wildly varying expectations. In Lantern, a jet pilot (Reynolds) receives a mystical ring and lantern that let him materialize anything in his imagination to fight the universe's more villainous tenants.
Comic devotees are hoping Lantern signals a superhero competition in theaters similar to the one waged on magazine shelves between DC and Marvel.
Warner Bros., which is releasing the movie and owns the rights to DC properties, needs a new franchise. Harry Potter bids adieu when the final film arrives July 15; the studio is banking on the $200 million space saga to fill at least a part of that void.
But the real test comes for DC's film division, whose big-screen hits have been limited to guys named Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne. While Superman and Batman remain the granddaddies of comic-book movies, DC has few young turks to inherit the mantle.
Studio executives are wagering they have found one in Hal Jordan, the reluctant human hero in Lantern.
Should Lantern glow enough to become DC's version of Iron Man, analysts say, the movie could expedite film versions of Flash and Wonder Woman. Most enticing: the prospect of an all-star Justice League film, which could include the dark knight, the man of steel and Hal Jordan, aka Green Lantern. Flash and Wonder Woman are in pre-production, and Warner Bros. is eyeing a 2013 League release, but their paths could be forged by Lantern.
Superheroes could use a hand. While Thor did a respectable $174 million since premiering in early May, X-Men: First Class has generated only middling business despite stellar reviews. The $160 million movie has grossed $104 million since its release June 3.
What will fanboys think?
Lantern also faces a challenge as imposing as any Sinestro ever laid at his feet: fanboy skepticism. Like Fantastic Four, Lantern is aimed directly at families — not always an endearing quality to comic devotees who like their villains twisted and their heroes emotionally fragile.
"I have my worries about Green Lantern," Graeme McMillan of comicbookresources.com says. McMillan wonders whether the story's far-out theme — that 3,600 Green Lanterns patrol the universe with magic rings, lanterns and willpower — will feel dated for the YouTube generation.
"It might be too out-there for audiences used to the more grounded superheroics of Spider-Man, Iron Man and Batman," McMillan says. But, he adds, "that audience seems to dig the similarly ridiculous, out-there Transformers movies."
McMillan says the movie's fantasy themes could mean "smash hit."
Reynolds concedes the scrutiny over Lantern's powers has been unnerving.
"I've never been on a production like this," says Reynolds, who adds that the tone of the movie was a central debate before filming. "It isn't dark, it isn't precious, it's not made for a subsection of fanboys. We wanted to make a superhero movie you can take the kids to, and we did that."
All that's left are the kids, a demographic that Lantern director Martin Campbell says has gone largely ignored by modern-day crime fighters. Campbell, who resuscitated the 007 franchise with his Casino Royale, says that while he used Iron Man as his modern-day muse, he went decades back for true inspiration.
"I watched the original Superman," Campbell says of the 1978 Christopher Reeve classic. "That tone, that sense of humor and slight mischievous quality between Clark Kent and Lois Lane, that's what I wanted."
This time around, Campbell's Lois is Blake Lively, a 23-year-old actress who claims to have known nothing about Green Lantern before she began reading — and geeking out — over the intergalactic comic.
"You don't want to know what I first pictured when I saw the name Green Lantern," says Lively, who plays love interest Carol Ferris. "I mean, a magical ring? A magical lamp?"
Superhero who is human
But as she delved into the comic, she was drawn into the story "of a superhero who didn't want to be a superhero. A superhero who is human. That really interested me."
Now she sounds like a Comic-Con pilgrim. "There are so many stories you can tell," she says. "And the technology is there to show things only in your dreams. You couldn't have made this movie in decades past."
Not only for technical reasons. Created by writer Bill Finger and artist Martin Nodell in 1940, Lantern's story of space-traveling crime fighters whose magic rings let them create anything within their imagination had grown stale for most readers and was a flailing comic by 2004.
Enter Geoff Johns, a popular comic-book scribe who reintroduced Hal Jordan as Green Lantern and made a name by infusing Superman and Flash with a more contemporary worldview. In 2010, he became DC's chief creative officer, and he produced the movie.
Johns, too, says that tenor is key to Green Lantern's success. Johns, who says he isn't "a big fan of camp," says the film recognizes some of the comic's elements that might make kids roll their eyes. The movie serves up several scenes of Reynolds doing the same thing.
Campbell says that he used producer Donald Deline as the movie's "cheese meter." "If we approached anything that might be corny, Donald would start yelling," Campbell says.
Deline says he didn't do much shrieking, but did want to "go straight at what could be silly or absurd. We let the audience know we have to take this leap to get into that rich mythology. But it was a balancing act" — one Johns says has been missing from fantasy films of late.
In Lantern, "you've got fun aliens, green power, an intergalactic police force. It's obviously more accessible for family audiences, but you still have to take yourself seriously enough. I was a big Star Wars geek, and that's how we wanted to approach it. The Green Lantern universe is as vast as any."
Will it be as profitable? Jim Littler, founder of comicbookmovie.com, says that while Lantern's throwback approach "has given people some pause, fans are overwhelmingly excited Green Lantern's coming to the big screen. They see it as a good sign."
While the film won't make friends of DC and Marvel loyalists, fanboys see a surging comic's tide lifting all superhero boats.
"Sure, people will have their complaints; they always do," Littler says. "But this is a comic-book fan's dream summer."
