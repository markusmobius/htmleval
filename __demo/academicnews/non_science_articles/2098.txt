C.I.A. Employee Fired for Alleged Leak
WASHINGTON, April 21 Â The Central Intelligence Agency has dismissed a senior career officer for disclosing classified information to reporters, including material for The Washington Post's Pulitzer Prize-winning articles about the agency's secret prisons overseas for terror suspects, intelligence officials said today.
The C.I.A. would not identify the leaker, but several government officials said it was Mary O. McCarthy, a veteran intelligence analyst who until 2001 was senior director for intelligence programs at the National Security Council, where she served under Presidents Clinton and Bush. . At the time of her dismissal, Ms. McCarthy was working in the agency's inspector general's office, after a four-year stint at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based organization that examines global security issues.
The dismissal of Ms. McCarthy provided fresh evidence of the Bush administration's determined efforts to stanch leaks of classified information. The Justice Department has separately opened preliminary investigations into the disclosure of information to The Post, for its articles about secret prisons, as well as to The New York Times, for articles last fall that disclosed the existence of a warrantless domestic eavesdropping program supervised by the National Security Agency. Those articles were also recognized this week with a Pulitzer Prize, awarded to two New York Times reporters.
Several former veteran C.I.A. officials said the dismissal of an agency employee was rare and perhaps unprecedented. One official recalled the firing of a small number of agency contractors, including retirees, for leaking several years ago. Ms. McCarthy's dismissal was announced at the C.I.A. on Thursday in an e-mail sent by Porter J. Goss, the agency's director, who has made the effort to stop unauthorized disclosure of secrets a top priority. News of the dismissal was first reported today by MSNBC.
Her departure followed an internal investigation by the C.I.A.'s Security Center, as part of an intensified effort that began in January to scrutinize employees who had access to particularly sensitive information. She was given a polygraph examination, confronted about answers given to the polygraph examiner and confessed, the government officials said. On Thursday she was stripped of her security clearance and escorted out of C.I.A. headquarters.
"A C.I.A. officer has been fired for unauthorized contact with the media and for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information," said C.I.A. spokesman Paul Gimigliano. "This is a violation of the secrecy agreement that is the condition of employment with C.I.A. The officer has acknowledged the contact and the disclosures."
Mr. Gimigliano said the Privacy Act prohibited him from identifying the employee.
Intelligence officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said the dismissal resulted from "a pattern of conduct" and not from a single leak, but that the case involved in part information about secret C.I.A. detention centers that was leaked to The Washington Post.
Ms. McCarthy's departure was another unsettling jolt for the C.I.A., battered in recent years over faulty prewar reporting in Iraq, waves of senior echelon departures following the appointment of Porter J. Goss as director and the diminished standing of the agency under reorganization of the country's intelligence agency.
The C.I.A.'s inquiry focused in part on identifying Ms. McCarthy's role in supplying information for a Nov. 2, 2005, article in The Post, by Dana Priest, a national security reporter for the newspaper. The article reported that the intelligence agency was sending terror suspects to clandestine detention centers in several countries, including Eastern Europe.
Leonard Downie Jr., The Post's executive editor said on the newspaper's Web site, that he could not comment on the firing, because he did not know the details surrounding it. "As a general principle, obviously I am opposed to criminalizing the dissemination of government information to the press."
Eric C. Grant, a spokesman for the newspaper would not address whether any C.I.A. employee was a source for the secret prison articles, but said, "No Post reporter has been subpoenaed or talked to investigators in connection with this matter."
The article provoked an outcry among European allies and set off protests among Democrats in Congress. The article prompted the C.I.A. to send a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Lawyers at the Justice Department were notified of Ms. McCarthy's dismissal, but no new referral was issued, according to law enforcement officials. They said they will review the case, but that her termination could mean she will be spared criminal prosecution.
Late last year, current and former government officials said, Mr. Goss ordered polygraphs for intelligence officers who knew about certain "compartmented" programs, including the secret detention centers for suspected terrorists. Polygraphs are given routinely to agency employees at least every five years, but special polygraphs can be ordered when a security breach is suspected.
The results of such exams are regarded as important indicators of deception among some intelligence officials. But they are not admissible as evidence in court Â and the C.I.A.'s reliance on the polygraph in Mc. McCarhty's case could make it more difficult for the government to prosecute her.
"This was a very aggressive internal investigation," said one former C.I.A. officer with more than 20 years' experience. "Goss was determined to find the source of the secret jails story."
With the encouragement of the White House and some Republicans in Congress, Mr. Goss has spoken out repeatedly against leaks, saying foreign intelligence officials had asked him whether his agency was incapable of keeping secrets.
In February, Mr. Goss told the Senate Intelligence Committee that "the damage has been very severe to our capabilities to carry out our mission." He said it was his hope "that we will witness a grand jury investigation with reporters present being asked to reveal who is leaking this information. I believe the safety of this nation and the people of this country deserves nothing less."
Ms. McCarthy has been a well-known figure in intelligence circles. She began her career at the agency as an analyst and then a manager in the intelligence directorate, working at the African and Latin America desks, according to a biography by the strategic studies center. With an advanced degree from the University of Minnesota she has taught, authored a book on the Gold Coast and was director of the Social Science data archive at Yale University.
Public records show that Ms. McCarthy contributed $2,000 in 2004 to the presidential campaign of John Kerry, the Democratic candidate.
Republican lawmakers praised the C.I.A. effort. Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, the Republican chairman of the senate intelligence committee, said, "I am pleased that the Central Intelligence Agency has identified the source of certain unauthorized disclosures, and I hope that the Agency, and the Community as a whole, will continue to vigorously investigate other outstanding leak cases."
Several former intelligence officials Â who were granted anonymity after requesting it for what they said were obvious reasons under the circumstances Â were divided over the likely effect of the dismissal on morale. One veteran said the firing would not be well-received coming so soon after the disclosure of grand jury testimony by Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff that Mr. Bush in 2003 approved the leak of portions of a secret national intelligence estimate on Iraqi weapons.
"It's a terrible situation when the president approves the leak of a highly classified N.I.E., and people at the agency see management as so disastrous that they feel compelled to talk to the press," said one former C.I.A. officer with extensive overseas experience.
But another official, whose experience was at headquarters, said most employees would approve the action by Mr. Goss. "I think for the vast majority of people this will be good for morale," the official said. "People didn't like some of their colleagues deciding for themselves what secrets should be in The Washington Post or The New York Times."
"Classified information is classified information. It's not to be leaked. It's not to be divulged," said Paul R. Pillar, who was the agency's senior analyst for the Middle East until he retired late last year. Mr. Pillar has recently been critical of the Bush administration's handling of pre-war intelligence about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs.
In recent weeks, the government has broadened its efforts to counter leaks in a number of other ways. Prosecutors have brought charges against two former employees of a pro-Israel lobbying organization who are scheduled to go on trial next month for illegally disseminating classified military information to journalists and Israeli officials.
Lawyers for Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman, the two former officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee who have been charged, complained in legal papers filed today that F.B.I. agents engaged in misconduct in their efforts to obtain access to the archives of the late columnist Jack Anderson, apparently to determine whether he had any classified documents that relate to the case.
