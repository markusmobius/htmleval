Economy/Unemployment; Gaza Burning; Panetta Kerfuffle
 
 We've invented a new dessert: the Panetta Kerfuffle, but that comes later in the show. First we collectively decide that Obama's big speech about the economy may not be big enough. Then the inevitable disagreements over the Israel/Gaza conflict are discussed. No end in sight. And finally: the Panetta Kerfuffle. Take one former Clinton Chief of Staff, throw in the initials CIA, mix together with whining establishment Senators and Congressional Representatives, add a dose of media and questions about Biden's involvement and -- you've got the Panetta Kerfuffle.
