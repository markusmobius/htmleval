Senate Affirms Ambassador for Freedom of Religion
WASHINGTON — The Senate has confirmed the nomination of David N. Saperstein, a prominent Reform rabbi, to be ambassador at large for international religious freedom, in charge of countering religious persecution around the world.
The vote on Friday was 62 to 35, with all but one of the no votes cast by Republicans.
For 40 years, Mr. Saperstein has been director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, lobbying on a wide range of civil rights and social justice issues. His supporters hoped the appointment would elevate the importance of religious freedom in American foreign policy.
At a confirmation hearing in September, Mr. Saperstein spoke out against religious discrimination in Burma, China, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Syria, among other countries. “Even in Western Europe,” he said, “we are witnessing a steady increase in anti-Semitic discourse and violence against Jewish communities.”
Senators who voted against Mr. Saperstein did not say why they opposed him. On a number of domestic issues, he has sided with liberals. He delivered the invocation at the Democratic convention that nominated President Obama in 2008.

A memo from the Senate Republican Policy Committee noted that Mr. Saperstein had criticized a ruling in June in which the Supreme Court said that some corporations could deny contraception coverage to their female workers on religious grounds. He expressed dismay at the ruling, which was hailed by conservatives as a victory for religious liberty, and he supported legislation to override the decision, in an effort to protect women’s health.
Mr. Saperstein has also worked closely with Christian conservatives to protect religious liberty.
Barrett Duke, vice president for public policy at the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, described him as “a passionate and capable defender of international religious freedom.”
