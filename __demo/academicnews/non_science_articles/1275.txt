Jennifer Lopez And Alex Rodriguez Are Reportedly Dating
This romance is in a league of its own.
J-Lo + A-Rod = ?
Figure that one out while you ponder reports on Wednesday that Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez are dating.
The two have been seeing each other “for a few weeks,” an unidentified source told People Wednesday, which followed a report from Lovebscott.com.
Lopez “seems excited” but is being cautious, the People source said.
The New York Daily News reported the two have been together for months and were spotted together backstage after a recent Lopez concert at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.

Was this meeting at a Yankees game in 2005 a harbinger of things to come?

A source identified as an “insider” told the New York Post’s Page Six, “They are really into each other because they have so much in common — from their Latin roots, to their love of New York, and their kids.”
Rodriguez, the 41-year-old Yankees legend and father of two who retired last season, took a full-time job with Fox this month as an MLB analyst. Lopez, a 47-year-old mother of twins, is on her second season of the cop drama “Shades of Blue.” 
Both have widely chronicled romantic histories with A-listers. Rodriguez has been linked to Madonna, Kate Hudson and Cameron Diaz, and had recently been dating Silicon Valley tycoon Anne Wojcicki, the Daily News reported.
Lopez finalized her divorce from singer Marc Anthony in 2014 and previously had relationships with Ben Affleck and P. Diddy and was rumored in December to have been seeing Drake, although she denied those claims.
When The Huffington Post inquired about the relationship between Lopez and Rodriguez, a publicist for Lopez declined comment.
