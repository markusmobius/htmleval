Watch: LeBron James accepts SI Sportsperson of the Year Award
CLOSE

 LeBron James speaks on being honored alongside athletes such as Jim Brown, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Muhammad Ali. 

On the same day he announced that he will produce a multi-part documentary about Muhammad Ali’s life and career for HBO, and just weeks after he donated $2.5 million to support the Muhammad Ali exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, LeBron James once again paid homage to the man known as "The Greatest."
While accepting his Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year Award Monday night during an award gala at the Barclay's Center, James, humble and honest, spoke about how Ali — as well as Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Jim Brown — paved the way for him, both on and off the court.

"This award is not for me," James began. "This award is for my wife. This award is for my mother. This award is for my three kids back home. This award is for my mother, for my mother-in-law, for my father-in-law, for my sister, for my foundation and all 2,300 kids that I got in my foundation. This award is for the great Muhammad Ali, for Bill Russell, for Jim Brown, for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar."
“It’s never about the individual,” James said. “It’s always about the people behind them. It’s always about the people that’s behind the camera. It’s always about the people that doesn't get the credit. It’s always about the people that always sacrifice what they think or what they believe they could be doing more with their lives for the better of the individual.”
