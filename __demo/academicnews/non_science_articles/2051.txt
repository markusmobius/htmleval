A Family Sedan for the Speedway
Dodge says Charger Hellcat can hit 204 m.p.h. Credit Chrysler Group

Its wheelbase is 4.2 inches longer and it has two additional doors, but the Dodge Charger sedan is virtually a mechanical twin of the Challenger coupe. So it was straightforward enough to move the parts that turn a Challenger into a Hellcat over to the Charger. The 2015 Charger Hellcat, which arrives this fall at an expected price above $60,000, will be powered by the same supercharged 707-horsepower Hemi V8 found in the Challenger Hellcat.
The Charger Hellcat will not only be the most powerful sedan from any mainstream manufacturer, but it may be the fastest four-door on earth. Because the Charger body is more aerodynamically efficient than the Challenger’s, the top speed is higher: 204 miles per hour, compared with the Challenger Hellcat’s 199.
In 1970, Buddy Baker’s Dodge Charger Daytona became the first Nascar racecar to lap the Talladega speedway in Alabama at over 200 m.p.h. The Charger Hellcat — with air-conditioning, air bags and seating for five — could be faster, at least in theory.
