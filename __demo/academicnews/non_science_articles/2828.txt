 J.R. Smith: 8.6. When he's not draining 3's for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Smith is draining putts at the local links. *Scores via http://www.ghin.com/lookup.aspx as of July 1, 2017. Tony Dejak, AP 

 None 
 Bill Murray: 7.2. His character in Caddyshack looped for the Dalai Lama himself, so it's no wonder he boasts a 7 handicap. Jonathan Ferrey 

 None

 None 
 Michael Jordan: 1.9. The greatest basketball player of all-time isn't too shabby with a driver in his hand, either. Matt Dunham, AP

 None
