Sen. Joe Lieberman, a former Democratic vice presidential nominee who campaigned for the Republican presidential ticket in 2008, called Sarah Palin a "powerful force" who speaks for "a lot of people out there."

In an interview with Newsmax.TV, Lieberman described Sen. John McCain's former running mate as "warm and likable," and warned her opponents not to dismiss her or what she has to say. The Connecticut senator, who left the Democratic Party and is now an independent, said "everybody should listen" to her.
I think ... Sarah Palin for a lot of people has become a spokesperson. People worried that government has forgotten them, that it has grown too big, that the deficit is growing too large, and in some sense that we're not being as strong as we should be in the world — Governor Palin has spoken to those concerns as much as anyone.
I do disagree with her on some of the specifics that she has said, but I think anybody who underestimates Sarah Palin as a political force in America does so at some peril, because she is speaking for a lot of people out there.
