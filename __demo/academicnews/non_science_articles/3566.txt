Southern California terminated associate head men’s basketball coach Tony Bland as a result of federal bribery and corruption charges that were unsealed in September, his attorney told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday.
Jeffrey Lichtman said in an email that Bland was terminated last Friday by USC due to the ongoing case. Bland was placed on administrative leave by the school after federal prosecutors indicted Bland and nine others – including an Adidas executive --- in the wake of a probe that rocked college basketball and led to the downfall of Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino at the University of Louisville.
“Obviously he's disappointed but appreciates all that USC has done for him during his time there and wishes the team the best of luck this season and in the future,” said Lichtman, a New York-based attorney who has represented the likes of John Gotti Jr. and Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.
USC said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports that Bland “is no longer employed by USC.”
The Los Angeles Times was the first outlet to report that Bland had been terminated.
Bland, who was released after he posted $100,000 bond soon after the indictment, faces up to 80 years in prison if he’s convicted on all four counts: conspiracy to commit bribery, solicitation of bribery and gratuities, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
A pre-trial conference in the case is scheduled Feb. 15, according to online court records.
“We're still receiving and reviewing discovery,” Lichtman said. “The defendants in one of the other case(s) already made a motion to dismiss. So we should find out that result in a few weeks.”
