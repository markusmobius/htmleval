What $9,000 can buy instead of an Acer laptop
4 Shares 




Acer says its latest gaming laptop, the Predator 21 X, targets "ultimate gaming enthusiasts who only want the best."

The price for "the best" in gaming tech? According to Acer, it's $9,000.
At CES 2017, Acer revealed its premium gaming laptop with top-of-the-line processors, memory and a 21-inch curved display. It also boasts really cool eye-tracking technology compatible with more than 45 PC games.
Clearly, anyone who spends the $8,999 on the Predator 21 X will receive a beast of a laptop. But there is so much tech you could purchase with that much cash. For some perspective, here's how far you can go with $9,000:
Three MacBook Pros. This is the latest, 15-inch model with the Touch Bar, 2.7GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor and 512 GB of storage at $2,799.99. Remember the super expensive Mac Pro model Apple introduced in 2013? You can buy up to 3 of those, too.
Four 55-inch Samsung 4K Smart TVs. Get a curved 4K display for every room in your home!
13 iPhone 7 smartphones. This is for the entry level, 32 GB model. One for you and 12 of your closest family and friends.
180 Amazon Echo Dots. That's a lot of Alexa.
75 years of Netflix. If you pick the streaming giant's $9.99 plan, and paid up front (because of course you would), you would be covered for 899 months. Hope you like House of Cards.
