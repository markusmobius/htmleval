Sarah Palin had a Katie Couric moment over the weekend during the White House Correspondents Dinner festivities.
At the MSNBC after party, NBC's blog NBCU Direct asked several party attendees the following question: Who do you think is the most influential journalist today?
But while most of the attendees had no problem coming up with answers (Eliot Spitzer said Brian Williams, as did Andrea Mitchell, while SNL's Bill Hader went for The New Yorker's David Grann), Palin fumbled when asked. 
"Oh my goodness, that's a great question," she said, before turning to her husband Todd and asking for his input. 
When Todd also balked, Palin came back and said, "Um, gosh, that's a great question, I have to think about it, OK? Because there are many."
As Palin walked away from the camera, she ran into her Fox News pal Greta Van Susteren, and then turned back to the NBC cameras to shout, "Greta Van Susteren is the most influential journalist!"

The exchange called to mind Palin's infamous 2008 exchange with Katie Couric, where she could not name a single newspaper or magazine that informed her worldview. That interview set off a bit of a back-and-forth between the two, with Palin going so far as to mock the recent news that Couric would be leaving CBS News to pursue a syndicated talk show.
