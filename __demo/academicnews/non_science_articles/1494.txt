"Grumpy Cat" snatches lump of cash in California court
SANTA ANA, Calif. — It still won't make her smile, but Grumpy Cat has won some scratch. 
 A California jury gave the furry frown queen more than $700,000 this week in a federal lawsuit over the use of her identity. 
 According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, owner Tabatha Bundesen of Morristown, Arizona, won the lawsuit first filed three years ago against the Grenade beverage company. 
 She signed on for the cat to endorse a "Grumpy Cat Grumpuccino," but the company subsequently used the cat's image to help sell other products, which an eight-person jury on Monday found was unauthorized. 
 “Ironically, while the world-famous feline Grumpy Cat and her valuable brand are most often invoked in a tongue-and-cheek fashion, Defendants’ despicable misconduct here has actually given Grumpy Cat and her owners something to be grumpy about,” the complaint obtained by The Washington Post stated.
