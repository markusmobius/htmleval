Instead, this concoction uses a combination of alpha hydroxy, beta hydroxy, and polyhydroxy acids that work together to break down the gluey bonds that stick dead skin cell to the healthy ones beneath them. 
It’s used like a toner ― after cleansing, and before moisturizing. With daily use, Solution promises smaller pores, fewer blackheads and blemishes, and reduced redness after four weeks, in addition to Glossier’s signature smooth, glowing skin that the brand is known for. 
Plus, like Glossier’s other cult-beloved products, Solution is dermatologist-tested, paraben-free and cruelty-free. Try it yourself for only $24.
