Victor Dorff is an educator, an author, a journalist, and a lawyer. He has taught First Amendment law to journalism students at New York University, Freshman Writing at the University of Southern California, and methods for teaching elementary mathematics to education students at California Lutheran University. He wrote and produced network television news for ABC in New York, was on the launch team of Space.com, and was CNBC.com's first Executive Producer. He currently writes books and teaches mathematics at a public charter school in Southern California and is doing research into the creation and maintenance of a culture of academic integrity in secondary schools. With his wife, Lisa Sonne, he co-founded and runs Charity Checks, the nonprofit that created in 1999 the first Giving Certificates. He sees all these things as elements of the core principals that underlie our society – freedom, intellectual creativity, and personal responsibility for ourselves and for each other.
