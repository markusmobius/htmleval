 In this most recent poll, Clinton leads among both women (60 percent to 37 percent) and men (53 percent to 44 percent), those 45 or older (67 percent to 29 percent) and non-whites (58 percent to 39 percent). 
 Sanders, meanwhile, is ahead among those under 45 (55 percent to 42 percent), plus those who consider themselves "very liberal" (53 percent to 46 percent) -- though the leads here are lower than they were in the earlier NBC/WSJ/Marist poll. 
 Geographically, Clinton enjoys a double-digit lead over Sanders in New York City and the suburbs, while the two are running even in Upstate New York -- essentially unchanged from the earlier NBC/WSJ/Marist poll. 
 And when it comes to religion, Clinton leads among likely New York Democratic primary voters who are Protestant (62 percent to 35 percent), Catholic (61 percent to 36 percent) and Jewish (65 percent to 32 percent). 
 The NBC 4 New York/WSJ/Marist poll was conducted April 10-13 of 591 likely Democratic primary voters, and the margin of error is plus-minus 4.0 percentage points.
