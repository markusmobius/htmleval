After Alabama’s thrilling comeback victory over Georgia in the national title game last night, the AFCA Awards Show will bring together 8,000 coaches and former coaches to celebrate the best in college football this season. The event will air live on USA TODAY.com and on USA TODAY Sports' Facebook page.
The awards show, presented by Amway, will be hosted by Rick Neuheisel, the former UCLA coach and Rose Bowl-winning quarterback for the Bruins, as well as former ESPN broadcaster Bonnie Bernstein. The night’s honors will include the FBS Coach of the Year, Allstate AFCA Good Works Team® Honorary Head Coach, and USA TODAY Sports Coach's Play Call of the Year.
Football fans can look forward to appearances by Central Florida’s (and now Nebraska’s) Scott Frost, former Huskers coach Frank Solich, Georgia’s Kirby Smart, Virginia’s Bronco Mendenhall, Wisconsin’s Paul Chryst, Northwestern’s Pat Fitzgerald, Iowa State’s Matt Campbell, Fresno State’s Jeff Tedford, and Liberty’s Turner Gill. Former Marshall coach Jack Lengyel will be honored, along with Jenks (Okla.) High School coach Allan Trimble, who will receive the Power of Influence Award as he fights ALS. Coaches from FCS, Division II, Division III and NAIA will also be recognized.

Before the show’s kickoff, there will be a green-carpet event hosted by USA TODAY Sports Pulse’s Trysta Krick and Adam Woodard, along with USA TODAY Sports national college football writer George Schroeder. It will feature interviews with coaches as they arrive on the green carpet and will debut original videos shot at this year’s convention by USA TODAY Sports.
USA TODAY NETWORK is excited to give fans the opportunity to watch the AFCA Awards Show from a livestream platform and extend the fun of the college football season. The green-carpet event will be livestreamed via Facebook beginning at 6 p.m. ET from the NASCAR Hall of Fame, and the awards show will air live starting at 8 p.m. ET.
