No letting up: Hamilton quickest in Brazilian GP practices
SAO PAULO (AP) — Winning his fourth Formula One title did not slow Lewis Hamilton one bit.
The Englishman was quickest in both practice sessions for the Brazilian Grand Prix on Friday, keeping his word not to be distracted in the second-to-last race of the season.
Hamilton won his fourth Formula One title two weeks ago in Mexico City. Since then, he's stayed in the news by being named in the "Paradise Papers," showing he avoided paying more than $4 million in taxes on a private jet registered in the British Isle of Man, a tax haven.
Hamilton has declined comment on his legal case. His lawyers deny any wrongdoing.
Hamilton had the fastest lap in the morning session at Interlagos, and was slightly slower in the afternoon. In both sessions he was followed by Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas.
There is nothing left to decide in the season apart from who wins here and the season finale in two weeks in Abu Dhabi. Hamilton and Mercedes have won the drivers' and constructors' title.
Left to fight over is second and third. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel has 277 points, 15 clear of Bottas.
Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull is too far behind in fourth place to catch either.
Ricciardo had the third quickest time in the afternoon, and Vettel was just behind in fourth. They were followed by Max Verstappen of Red Bull and Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.
