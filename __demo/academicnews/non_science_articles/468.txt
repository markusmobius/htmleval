Sater has covered many international weather stories including Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013. While covering the landfall impact in the Philippines, he was one of the first international broadcasters to report that the storm's intense winds made it the strongest typhoon to make landfall on any landmass in recorded history. Earlier this year CNNI won the 'Best News Coverage -- International' category for its reporting of Typhoon Haiyan at the prestigious Royal Television Society Awards. 
Before joining CNNI, Sater worked as a meteorologist in a number of U.S. markets including Washington, D.C.; Atlanta, Georgia; Cincinnati, Ohio; Montgomery, Alabama and Lexington, Kentucky, where in 1998 he won a regional Emmy for Outstanding Weather Anchor at WKYT as the station's chief meteorologist. He ended up winning the same award four consecutive years during his time at WTTG in Washington, D.C.
Broadcasting runs in his family. Sater's wife, who was born in Punjab, India, is a morning news anchor for a local television station in Atlanta. They have twin girls and live on a small horse farm in north Georgia.
