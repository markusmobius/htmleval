Shohei Ohtani jokes he wanted Mike Trout's number
10 Shares 




Shohei Ohtani got a few laughs at one point in his press conference at Angel Stadium on Saturday, the day after it was announced that he officially chose to sign with the team.
It was when he was asked why he chose No. 17 rather than No. 11, which was the number he wore in Japan. Through a translator, Ohtani replied with a chuckle and said he actually wanted to wear No. 27 aka Mike Trout's number.
Shohei Ohtani wore No. 11 for the Nippon-Ham Fighters. His farewell news conference was on 11/11. His family dog was born on 11/11. But No. 11 was worn by Jim Fregosi and retired by the #Angels in 1998. https://t.co/oXxyVZ3plK

While the six-time All-Star and two-time AL MVP isn't going to give up his number, Trout probably enjoyed the joke. In fact, Ohtani might even get invited to Trout's wedding. The Angels star retweeted this:
Ohtani should crash Trout’s wedding. DM me for details bro! #WelcomeToAnaheim

Ohtani also shared a message for his teammates at the presser. He congratulated Trout on his marriage, and he said he looks forward to meeting everyone else and their families.
