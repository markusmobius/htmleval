We've learned more about the years of abuse the 13 Turpin children suffered in their home, and this will turn your stomach. The siblings were often tied up for weeks or months at a time. They were only allowed to shower once a year, and washing their hands above their wrists would trigger harsh punishments. They were rarely fed, with some so severely malnourished they have cognitive impairment. They sometimes were shown food but not allowed to eat it. Their parents, David and Louise Turpin, face 12 counts of torture and other charges, and David Turpin is charged with a lewd act on a child. A judge set their bail at $12 million each. They've entered not guilty pleas on all counts. MUST WATCH DA
