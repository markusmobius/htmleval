Kristen Stewart Rocked Spanx As A Dress On 'SNL' -- And It Looked Great
It's possible only K-Stew is brave enough to do this.
Who says Spanx always have to go under your clothes? 
Kristen Stewart made the case for wearing the slimming undergarments as outwear while hosting “Saturday Night Live” this past weekend.
The 26-year-old actress rocked a black Spanx slip dress with a mesh skirt on top, then paired the outfit with Chanel jewels and Christian Louboutin heels, according to an Instagram photo from her stylist, Tara Swennen. 

Only K-Stew is brave enough to do this.

Her slicked-back hair and smoky eye makeup completed the rocker-chic look: 

YES.


She is, without a doubt, the coolest.


What Would Vampires Wear?

As Elle pointed out, the $78 Spanx slip is still available online if you’d like to recreate the look for yourself. Kristen Stewart’s confidence sold separately.
