In Plain Sight: Poverty in America
Share
 More than 5 years after the Great Recession, 15 percent of Americans – more than 46 million – live below the poverty line, and income inequality in the U.S. is at its highest level since the 1920s. 
 For more than a year, NBC News has embarked on a special editorial initiative to cover how poverty and inequality affect the lives of millions of Americans. The project, In Plain Sight: Poverty in America, is supported by a grant from the Ford Foundation.
