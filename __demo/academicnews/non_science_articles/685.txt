Arianna appeared on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS to discuss Greece's economic issues.
"There is no work," she said. "You have 40% youth unemployment...these are people who feel they have no hope for the future."
She also weighed in how Greece might tackle its problems.
"Greece may decide to leave the euro simply in order to prevent civil unrest and to be able to start growing the economy again," she said.
