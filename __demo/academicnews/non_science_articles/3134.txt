Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this article misstated the length of a French president's term. 
Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy announced Monday that he will run again in 2017, hoping to topple unpopular socialist François Hollande.
Sarkozy, 61, lost to Hollande in 2012 after serving one, five-year term.
Since 2010, Sarkozy has been named in legal cases related to corruption and influence-peddling, but has never been convicted or appeared at a trial.
“I have decided to be a candidate for the 2017 presidential election," the conservative Sarkozy announced on Twitter. "I felt I had the strength to lead this battle at a troubled time in our history.” His book, Everything for France, will be published Wednesday.

France is on high alert after a string of terror attacks since January 2015.
Sarkozy must first win the primaries organized by the French right in November. The presidential election will happen in April and May. Hollande, whose approval rating is hovering at less than 20% in recent polls, has not announced whether he will seek re-election.
