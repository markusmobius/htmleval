Squarespace is latest to purge sites after Charlottesville
The petition also called out Squarespace's Acceptable Use Policy, which says users cannot "advocate bigotry or hatred against any person or group based on their race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual preference, age or disability." 
 "Squarespace's continued hosting of these sites constitutes an in-kind contribution to neo-nazis, white supremacists, and the violence they promote -- in Charlottesville and elsewhere," said Joseph Brown, who created the petition. 
 Squarespace's move comes after GoDaddy (GDDY) and Google Domains (GOOGL) dropped white supremacist and neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer earlier this week after it published a derogatory story about Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old woman killed protesting a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday. The Daily Stormer moved to a Russian domain Wednesday, but the site is now unavailable. 
 Other tech companies such as PayPal (PYPL) and crowdfunding service GoFundMe have also taken a stand this week against hate speech. 
 "Tech companies feel increasing pressure to police speech on their platforms and to take down speech that the vast majority of people find to be offensive, vile and hateful," said David Snyder, executive director at the First Amendment Coalition.
