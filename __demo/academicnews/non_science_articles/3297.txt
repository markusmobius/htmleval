It's that time again. The Girl Scouts start selling their famous cookies Wednesday — just as the holiday gluttony ends.
The organization brings back a 2017 favorite, the S'more, along with the traditional Thin Mints, Samoas and Trefoils for its 101st year of cookie selling. 
More than 1 million Girl Scouts sell about 200 million boxes of cookies each cookie selling season, generating about $800 million. All of the money remains in a council's local area, funding Girl Scouts' activities and community projects. 
Often sold at booths and door-to-door, cookies can only be purchased through a Girl Scout during cookie season, which lasts from January to April. Specific start dates vary by area. Cookies also can be purchased online through a scout's Digital Cookie page. Ask your local Girl Scouts cookie seller about this process.
