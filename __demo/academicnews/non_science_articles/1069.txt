 Kate has embraced her creative quirks since she was a kid, owning the title of jane-of-all trades. Growing up in Hollywood, she cultivated her on camera talents as an actress in television and feature films including Entourage, The Princess Diaries, Sex & the City and My Best Friend’s Girl while also getting her degree behind the camera in film production. After training as a metalsmith she launched her own unique, high-quality jewelry line, quickly becoming one of Hollywood’s most trendy jewelry designers as her collections began popping up on A-List celebrities, and featured in top style publications. Kate’s knack for interior design, style and DIY led her to start the Mr. Kate blog to chronicle the creative projects that got her featured on camera on OWN’s Home Made Simple, the Nate Berkus show and NBC’s Today, among others. Most recently, Kate’s book “A Hot Glue Gun Mess” was released via Harper Collins, and Kate was named a Creative Innovator by Conde Nast and an It-Girl by W Magazine.
