194 entries, more than a handful having STRAP for STROP, for which I can see no justificarion. Favourite clue (of 13 nominated): two stood out well above the rest, ‘Tea for one, all but the last muffin’ (CHAPERON) two ahead of ‘Savage (female?) may be addressed thus rudely, or in unctuous fashion’ (OILILY). The latter was a bit cheeky, as I’m not sure Paul O’Grady still does his drag act as Lily Savage, but I couldn’t resist it. Apologies to bemused younger solvers, but there’s always Google. Talking of which, I was a bit surprised how many said they’d not previously come across Simone Weil and (especially) the Battle of Plassey, one of Clive of India’s most famous victories (helped, it’s true, by the duplicitous behaviour of a large section of the opposing army). And on the subject of encyclopaedic knowledge, Dr Burscough (VHC above) writes, in reference to his clue, ‘You will no doubt recall that “Put a ring on it” was the subtitle of Beyoncé’s 2008 chart-topper “Single Ladies”’ Flattering, but erroneous. I am woefully ignorant where popular music is concerned.
Lots of nice ideas for PROPOSAL, with ‘& lit.’ clues well to the fore and plenty of references to the royal engagement, as was to be expected. Mr Leyland’s first prize-winner, which falls into neither of these categories, is a real gem (shades of Bronco?). It raised a question in my mind about his use of the word ‘tender’, which Chambers labels ‘US’ as a meaning of PROPOSAL. I would dispute this, not least because it defines TENDER, among other senses, as ‘an offer or proposal’, with no geographical marker. 
 Since the last competition news has reached me of the death of Mary Macnutt (Ximenes’ widow) at the age of 100, after she’d outlived him by an astonishing 47 years. Though she was a special (and very lively) guest at one of the Azed lunches, I had lost touch with her in recent years and never knew her well, though my wife still remembers the Macnutt family from her childhood at Christ’s Hospital School, where her father and X both taught.
