Although the Tampa Bay Buccaneers suffered through one of the most disappointing seasons they’ve had in years, there were still several bright spots and Tampa Bay’s lethal 2017 draft class was at the heart of it all.
Tight end O.J. Howard, safety Justin Evans and wide receiver Chris Godwin were among the team’s biggest stars after wrapping up a remarkable rookie campaign for the struggling Buccaneers.
Howard tied with star tight end Cameron Brate for the team-lead with six touchdowns. He also finished the year with 26 receptions for 432 receiving yards. Howard emerged as one of the Buccaneers’ most lethal weapons and one of Winston’s most reliable targets alongside Brate and Mike Evans, proving that his future in the NFL is incredibly bright.
Meanwhile, Evans racked up 66 tackles and tied for the team-lead with three interceptions which also happened to be second among all rookie safeties in the NFL.
Godwin also shined this season, especially as a starter in Mike Evans’ absence. The former Penn State product proved that he was an absolute steal when the Bucs selected him in the third-round of the draft. Godwin finished his 2017 campaign with 34 catches for 525 receiving yards and one touchdown.
Though the Bucs didn’t live up to expectations this year, their rookie class surely did. Now all Jason Licht can hope for is an even better 2018 draft class to upgrade the team’s roster.
