The Baseball Hall of Fame is an extremely exclusive club.
There are only 222 players who have been elected into Cooperstown, less than 2% of all players who reached the major league level. 
Combined with Negro League players, the total number of plaques increases to 249. Altogether, when we include managers, umpires and executives, the total enshrined is 319.
