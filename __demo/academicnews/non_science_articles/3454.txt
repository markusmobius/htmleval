Scott Disick enters rehab
Scott Disick, father to three kids with Kourtney Kardashian, has entered rehab.
He put out a press release about it on Monday, the day after a new season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians premiered.
Disick has checked into the luxurious Rythmia Life Advancement Center in Costa Rica.
TMZ says the move came after Disick was stumbling around drunk in Atlantic City over the weekend.
"I realize my issues are bigger than me and I'm ready to truly remedy this struggle I continue to battle," Disick said in his release.
He went on to tout the facility's use of "iboga" treatment and the fact that the center offers a "money back guarantee."
The center, which offers a free helicopter ride to its facilities, explains that the iboga plant is a small tree that grows in Gabon, Africa, "whose roots contain 12 medicinal alkaloids."
The center uses the plant, along with 10 other therapy models, in its treatment and quotes Gerard Powell, Rythmia Center CEO as saying, "Unlike other rehab centers, RLAC does not believe addiction is a disease; we believe people like Scott become dependent on their vices due to past events they have not reconciled with, current conditions they cannot cope with, and things they believe aren't true."
Powell says in the release that he was a "chronic user of alcohol and cigarettes and had given up on getting rid of his addictions until he was introduced to the iboga plant in Costa Rica. After taking the iboga plant he felt it working right away and the next day no longer felt the need to drink alcohol or smoke."
