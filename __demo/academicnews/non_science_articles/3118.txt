Take a look inside LeBron’s new $23 million mansion
LeBron James' real estate game just got a major upgrade.
According to Trulia.com, the Cavaliers star purchased a $23 million, eight-bed, 11-bath mansion in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood. The newly constructed property would be his second Los Angeles-area home; he purchased a $20 million Brentwood home in 2015. 
This mansion, though, truly is spectacular. It includes an indoor-outdoor gym, a theater room with a massive TV, showroom-level walk-in closets, cigar room with air-filtration system, wine cellar, a spa and a car gallery — just to name a few of the amenities. 
Let's take a look inside. The photos are courtesy of Trulia.com.
