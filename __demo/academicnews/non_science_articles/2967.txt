If you’ve ever wished you could add some extra color to your Instagram stories, the company has some good news: the photo-sharing platform will offer six pride stickers and a new rainbow brush in honor of Pride Month.
This June, Instagram stories will feature six pride stickers created by LGBT artists that will allow users to “turn any photo or video into a visual celebration and show of solidarity,” according to a blog post published by the company Wednesday.
The stickers go beyond the standard rainbow flags, depicting a man in the midst of vogueing, a dance form that has roots in Latino and black LGBT communities. 
Other stickers include a rainbow megaphone, an artistic rendering of the word “queer,” rainbow-tinted sunglasses, a cartoon person with a heart on their chest and an eye with the trans flag as its iris and a heart as its pupil.

Pride Month is celebrated each June to commemorate the anniversary of the Stonewall Rebellion in New York City on June 28, 1969, according to GLAAD, a national LGBT media-monitoring organization. The rebellion against police raids of LGBT bars is viewed as a seminal moment in the birth of the LGBT rights movement, according to GLAAD. Pride events are held across the country and can vary from a weekend parade to an entire week of activities.
Instagram has also kicked off a “rainbow wall” initiative that will turn walls in cities around the world into “colorful beacons of support,” the company said on Wednesday. The first city to feature such a wall is Los Angeles, and murals in London, Madrid, Nashville and Cleveland will follow.
