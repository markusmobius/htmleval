CONNECTTWEET 34 LINKEDINEMAILMORE
Cincinnati Enquirer’s “Accused” podcast, which reach 7.5 million downloads in its first season, will return for an 8-episode second season.
 In season one, the Enquirer’s Amber Hunt and Amanda Rossmann examined the murder of Elizabeth Andes, a young woman found dead in her Ohio apartment in 1978, and asked the question: was the right man charged or did a killer actually walk free?
 Season 2 will look at the unsolved murder of Retha Welch. Welch was a prison minister in Kentucky when she was found killed in her apartment. Police suspected (and arrested) William Virgil, an ex-con she was said to have counseled. Hunt and Rossmann will dissect the grisly murder and look to uncover the truth behind who was really responsible for her death.
 “We were blown away by the response to season one of Accused and quickly learned from listeners that there are a lot of other cases out there in need of another look,” Amber Hunt said. “We hope that this series shines light on unsolved cases that, if we didn’t examine, would be left in the dark. By examining these stories, we hope to find answers as to what really happened. Our series is a great complement to other true crime podcasts across our network, in which other journalists are hard at work trying to uncover the truth.”
 “Accused”, which boasts 3.1 million listens, joins three other NETWORK podcast series on the Apple Podcasts charts in the News & Politics category: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s “Unsolved” (now in its second season), LoHud’s “Crime Scene,” and Rochester Democrat & Chronicle’s “Finding Tammy Jo.”
 “Accused” season 2 launches October 12.
