 'Saturday Night Live' uncloaks Steve Bannon and Oprah Winfrey makes a presidential bid in the first episode of 2018. 
The large discrepancy in pay Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams received for reshooting All the Money in the World was on Aidy Bryant's mind during Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update.
Three people familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY Wahlberg received $1.5 million while Williams was paid less than $1,000, the total of an $80 per diem. After public outcry followed Tuesday's report, Wahlberg and his agency, William Morris Endeavor, said Saturday morning they are committing $2 million to the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, according to a statement provided to USA TODAY by WME spokesperson Marie Sheehy. Wahlberg has pledged his $1.5 million fee and WME has donated $500,000 to be made in Williams’ name.
"Everyone's talking about how women should negotiate harder and ask for more money, and that's true," Bryant told Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost. "And, I really think women are ready to do that, but I feel like maybe just maybe, men could be just like this much more (decent)."
When Jost reminded Bryant that Wahlberg announced he was donating his reshoot pay, the former Girls actress commended the actor ... but then she also went in.
"Yes, and that's great," Bryant said. "That's the right thing to do, but it would be so cool if it didn't take a week-long public shaming to do the right thing. Maybe do a daily private shaming, which is what I have done my entire (expletive) life."
