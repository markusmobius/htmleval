A public conversation on sexual assault and harassment intensified throughout the United States in 2017. 
If you or someone you know is dealing with the aftermath of sexual assault, there are organizations that can help. Many are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and will confidentially listen, answer questions, provide local and legal resources and help determine the next steps. 
• Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) provides the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline, 1-800-656- HOPE (4673), which will route you to a local RAINN affiliate organization. You also can reach counselors online. RAINN provides in-depth resources and guides detailing how to reduce your risk of assault, the procedures to report these crimes and the process for healing and recovery. The network has a national database to help find a sexual assault service in your area.
