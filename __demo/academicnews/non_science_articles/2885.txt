 The Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise is seen in front of a tabular iceberg in Hope Bay on Trinity Peninsula, which is the northernmost part of the Antarctic Peninsula. Just outside Hope Bay, the Antarctic Sound connects the Bransfield Strait to the Weddell Sea. The Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is on a three-month expedition to the Antarctic to carry out scientific research, including seafloor submarine dives and sampling for plastic pollution, to highlight the need for the creation of the worldÕs largest protected area, an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary.
