Chef Masaharu Morimoto has more than a dozen restaurants in as many cities, adding Las Vegas to his roster on October 21 when he debuted his eponymous concept at MGM Grand. Sin City has its fair share of celebrity chefs, and Morimoto brings his signature Japanese cuisine and a one-of-a-kind teppan concept. We asked the Iron Chef four brief questions about finally opening on the Strip. Here's what he has to say.
What brings you to Las Vegas now?
People choose to come to Las Vegas from all over the world. I wanted to take the challenge. I mean, who doesn’t like Vegas?
What's your impression of the city's food scene and what do you want to bring to it?
It’s an honor to be able to open a restaurant in Las Vegas alongside fellow celebrity chefs. It's great — we talk about Vegas when we see each other.
My whole team will work together and bring our best while maintaining the consistency of our style.
