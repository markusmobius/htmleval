Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this report contained an incorrect spelling of LaBeouf's name. 
Folks, we've officially reached Peak Shia.
LaBeouf fans in NYC can join the actor as he watches all his own movies in reverse order over the next three days, live in a Manhattan movie theater, as part of what he's dubbing the #AllMyMovies project.
From noon on 10th November 2015, #ALLMYMOVIES by LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner will commence at the Angelika Film Center, 18 West Houston Street, NYC.
Visitors are invited to join Shia LaBeouf in person as he watches all his movies consecutively in reverse chronological order over the next three days, 24 hours a day (admission free).
Can't make it to the theater? Don't worry—he's live-streaming himself as he watches the films over the next three days, here.
Mere minutes after the stream started, there was already someone sitting directly behind him.
Nice one, random dude:

We have so many questions — will he sleep? Eat? Use the restroom? Cry at his own movies? Keep a straight face during Nymphomaniac? Rap along to the Holes song?
There's only one way to find out: keep watching Shia watch himself.
