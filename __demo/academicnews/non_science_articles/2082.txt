Vegan Mac N Cheez Recipe
Ingredients
 ½ large sweet potato, scrubbed and cut into large chunks. 
 1 medium carrot, top and tailed, washed and cut into thick slice 
 ½ small onion, peeled and halved 
 ¼ red bell pepper, thickly sliced 
 ½ cup broken cashew pieces (pre-soaked for 2-4 hours, or overnight) 
 ½ cup of nutritional yeast 
 ½ teaspoon turmeric 
 ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika 
 1 tablespoon sweet white miso 
 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
 Juice of ½ small lemon 
 Non-dairy milk, preferably unsweetened 
 Whole grain pasta 
 Salt to taste 
Preparation
In a vegetable steamer, steam the sweet potatoes, carrots, onion and red bell pepper until fork-soft, about 15 minutes. When the vegetables are half cooked, put the water on to boil for the pasta. Salt generously.
When the veggies are soft, put them in the blender with the remaining ingredients, then blend, adding milk until you obtain a thick pouring sauce. Stop blender once to scrape down the sides blend a little longer to get the sauce really smooth and creamy.
Drain the pasta and return to the pan. Pour the sauce over the pasta and stir over a low heat for a few minutes to warm through and combine thoroughly.
Serve with kid-friendly greens of your choice.
