Civilians should play role in policing cops: Your Say
Should only cops judge other cops? The answer to that question is no. That is an obvious conflict of interest.
Cops will absolutely be biased in favor of cops.
There should be a mix of people from various professions sitting on these police review boards. That’s just common sense.
—Brian Harris

Civilians who have no knowledge of the law, police codes, training and guidelines have no place on the trial boards.

A gun, a badge and a uniform do not give cops justification to violate the constitutional rights of citizens.
—Charles Patterson
Whenever a suspect is not cooperating, that suspect places officers in danger. I’m not sure why this is continually challenged. Safety will always be a priority for police.
—Larry Woodgeard
The simple fact is that the police must be held accountable for their crimes just as criminals are. In the police force, officers are often investigated by their own and often walk free.
This is unacceptable. If America cries foul when other nations commit such crimes, we should do the same about our own misdeeds. That is what this is supposed to be all about.
