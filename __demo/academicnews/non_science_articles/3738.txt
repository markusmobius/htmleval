McCowan scores 23, No. 2 Mississippi St beats Florida 90-53
STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) — Teaira McCowan scored 23 points, Victoria Vivians added 17 and No. 2 Mississippi State earned its best start to a season in program history with a 90-53 victory over Florida on Thursday night.
Mississippi State (21-0, 7-0 Southeastern Conference) shot 54 percent from the field, including 67 percent in the second half. Blair Schaefer added 15 points, making 5 of 8 shots from 3-point range.
Florida (10-11, 2-6) briefly made things interesting in the second quarter, cutting a 10-point deficit to 22-20 thanks to a 10-2 run.
But the Bulldogs responded with the next 13 points — seven from Vivians and six from Schaefer — to create some separation and take a 35-23 lead into halftime.
The Gators could never get any closer. Mississippi State pushed out to a 66-37 lead by the end of the third quarter and cruised to its 21st straight victory.
Florida was led Funda Nakkasoglu, who scored 19 points on 7 of 13 shooting.
BIG PICTURE
Florida: The Gators came into the game with some confidence after winning back-to-back league games against Arkansas and Ole Miss. They had some good moments against the Bulldogs — especially in the first half — but are still facing a talent deficit in coach Cameron Newbauer's first season.
Mississippi State: The Bulldogs looked a little sluggish early, which wasn't surprising since they were coming off an impressive 71-52 win over then-No. 6 Tennessee. Mississippi State recovered thanks to a balanced effort from Schaefer, Vivians and McCowan.
