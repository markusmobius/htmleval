 None 
 Murphy Brown (Candice Bergen): The title character was a veteran, single hard-news journalist who returned to her D.C.-based TV newsmagazine after a stint in rehab. GEORGE LANGE/CBS INC. 

 None 
 Memorable moment: In the May 18, 1992 Season 4 finale, the divorced Murphy gave birth to son Avery, the result of an unplanned reunion with her ex-husband Jake Lowenstein (Robin Thomas). The development famously led to a feud with then-Vice President Dan Quayle over what he called a 'lifestyle choice.' RICHARD CARTWRIGHT/CBS

 Where we left Murphy: In the May 1998, two-part finale, she underwent surgery to ensure she was free of cancer and dreamed she interviewed the only mover-and-shaker she's never interviewed before: God (Alan King). SPIKE NANNARELLO/CBS

 Life since 'Murphy Brown': The 71-year-old Bergen, left, has starred or had recurring roles in TV series such as ‘Sex and the City,’ ‘Boston Legal and ‘House.’ In 2017, she starred in the Netflix movie 'The Meyerowitz Stories' and the theatrical release 'Home Again' with Reese Witherspoon.

 Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford): A former Miss America-turned-journalist, the Louisiana native filled in for Murphy while she was in rehab. She was kept on to do puff pieces and struggled to be taken seriously by her more hard-news colleagues. Associated Press 

 None 
 Memorable marriages: Corky had two weddings the show. Both marriages resulted in amusing new surnames. In Season 2, she married a high-school classmate and became Corky Sherwood Forrest. And in Season 8, she wed 'FYI's neurotic producer, Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud), to the surprise of their colleagues. BYRON J COHEN/CBS

 Where we left Corky: She was finally getting respect and hard-news assignments. She also helped see Murphy through her breast-cancer scare. Joseph Viles/CBS 

 None 
 Life after 'Murphy Brown': From 2003 to 2006, Ford, now 53, starred in the ABC sitcom 'Hope and Faith' as a Hope, homemaker, whose life is upended when her soap-opera star sister, Faith (Kelly Ripa), returns. Since then, she has filmed a number of TV movies. GEORGE LANGE/ABC 

 None 
 Jim Dial: (Charles Kimbrough) The stuffy senior anchor of 'FYI' was an old-school journalist who loved to tell yarns about the glory days of Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite. CBS 

 None 
 Memorable moment: During Season 3, Jim went into hiding after he lost his temper on air, for fear that the one-off moment would become his legacy. TONY ESPARZA/CBS 

 None 
 Where we left Jim: The tightly-wound anchor loosened a little toward the end of the show's run. When Murphy's chemo treatments made her sick, he bought her pot and smoked with her. Later, he was caught with some of it at the airport. SPIKE NANNARELLO/CBS 

 None 
 Life since 'Murphy Brown': In addition to reviving Jim Dial on Fox's 'Family Guy,' Kimbrough (left), 81, has lent his voice to Disney’s ‘The Hunchback of Notre Dame’ and acted with another CBS star, Jim Parsons, in the 2012 Broadway revival of ‘Harvey.’ JOAN MARCUS 

 None 
 Frank Fontana (Joe Regalbuto): The 'FYI' investigative correspondent was Murphy's best friend. When he wasn't working, he was in therapy, where he likely discussed being forced to wear a toupée on camera. GEORGE LANG/CBS 

 None 
 Memorable moments: In Season 6, Frank's shrink declared him cured after 17 years in therapy. The following season, Frank was given his own show. When his colleagues got mad because it moved them out of their time slot, he misinterpreted it as jealousy. TONY ESPARZA/CBS 

 None 
 Where we left Frank: He got a visit from celebrity fan Julia Roberts in the series finale. CBS 

 None 
 Life since 'Murphy Brown': Regalbuto, 68, who directed 20 episodes of that classic sitcom, has helmed episodes of 'Friends' 'George Lopez,' and 'Hot in Cleveland.' He's also continued acting, with roles on 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' and 'Southland.' THEO WARGO,/GETTY IMAGES 

 None 
 Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud): The Jeff Zuckerberg-esque wunderkind producer, fresh from PBS, took over the reins at 'FYI' while Murphy was away in rehab and had to learn how to manage people who were older, richer and more famous than he was. JOSEPH VILES/CBS 

 None 
 Where we left Miles: After Shaud left the show at the end of Season 8, his character was shipped up to network headquarters in New York. Lily Tomlin joined the cast as the new showrunner for the last two seasons. JOSEPH VILES/CBS 

 None 
 Life since 'Murphy Brown': In recent years, Shaud, 56, has appeared on 'Younger,' 'Odd Mom Out,' 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' and 'Law & Order: SVU.' He has appeared at reunion events so that bodes well his participation in the reboot. THEO WARGO/GETTY IMAGES

 After 'Murphy Brown' ended, the show lost three actors whose characters were favorites. Pat Corley, 76, who played the owner of the 'FYI' gang's go-to bar, died in 2006. His character was killed off in Season 9 but he appeared in the series finale where he revealed he faked his death and went into hiding because he knew too much about the Clintons' Whitewater deal.

 None 
 Robert Pastorelli, who played Murphy's philosophical handyman-turned-nanny Eldin Bernecky, died of a heroin overdose in 2004. He was 49. CLIFF LIPSON/CBS INC. 

 None 
 Jay Thomas played Jerry Gold, a Jerry Springer-type talk-show host and Murphy's off-and-on-again lover. He died of cancer in August 2017 at age 69. NICK UT/AP 

 None 
 There will likely be one new-ish character: Murphy's adult son Avery, who would be in his mid-20s now. He was played as a toddler by Dyllan Christopher. 'Sixth Sense' star Haley Joel Osment played him in the final season. CBS
