Chipper Jones, Trevor Hoffman, Vladimir Guerrero and Jim Thome made up a four-player class into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
While Jones and Thome were expectedly elected as first-ballot Hall of Famers, Guerrero and Hoffman anxiously awaited the phone call from the Baseball Writers Association of America.
When that call finally came, it made for an incredible moment for each of the new Hall of Famers. This was how they reacted.

This was especially cool to see. Hoffman narrowly missed election into the Hall of Fame last year. That phone call was worth the wait.
