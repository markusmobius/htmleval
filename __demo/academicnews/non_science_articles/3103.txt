Listeria outbreak linked to Dole plant kills one
Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story misstated the number of people affected by the listeria outbreak.
A listeria outbreak that has claimed one life and sickened 11 others has been linked to a Dole processing plant in Springfield, Ohio.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that those affected by the outbreak, which began in July and spanned six states, had all eaten packaged salad, and some specifically recalled eating Dole brand. The CDC said that salads produced at the Dole Springfield facility "are the likely source" of the illness.
Dole is pulling all packaged salad on the market produced at the Springfield facility and has temporarily stopped all production there, according to a statement from the company. Dole said that the "suspension and withdrawal is being performed voluntarily by Dole out of an abundance of caution." No other Dole facilities are affected.
The salads were sold under several brand names, including Dole, Fresh Selections, Simple Truth and Marketside. The CDC's investigation began in September.
