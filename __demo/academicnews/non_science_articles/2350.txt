Tuckahoe, N.Y.: An Affordable Village With Growth on the Horizon

Amy Herzog and Jonathan Marino found northern Westchester County a bit too rural after moving to Goldens Bridge from Park Slope, Brooklyn, in 2014.
So when the couple decided to move again, they established some “pretty stringent criteria” for their new home, said Ms. Herzog, 34, a director at the MRM//McCann advertising agency in Manhattan.
They wanted a single-family rental within walking distance to a Metro-North Railroad station; a less-than-40-minute commute to Grand Central; easy access to restaurants and culture; and a yard for their dog, Brewtus. “Not to mention a good egg sandwich,” added Mr. Marino, 33, who works at Google.
The couple found all of that in Tuckahoe, a 0.6-square-mile village in the Town of Eastchester, in southern Westchester. In December 2016, they moved into a 1919 colonial with three bedrooms and 1,400 square feet, paying $3,100 in monthly rent. They can walk to either of the village’s two train stations. And there are egg sandwiches at the deli around the corner.
About 20 miles from Midtown Manhattan, Tuckahoe is one of Westchester’s more diverse communities. Its population of 6,600 is a mix of families who have owned homes there for generations and millennials escaping the high cost of living in the city. “They have no interest in owning,” said Agnes Aliberto, an associate broker with RE/MAX Prime Properties.

 18 PLEASANT PLACE A three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath colonial built in 1928, with 1,600 square feet on 0.07 acre, listed at $699,000. 914-879-2491 

Ms. Aliberto should know: She rents out the house that Ms. Herzog and Mr. Marino are living in; it was also where she grew up. “People don’t want to leave,” Ms. Aliberto said.
Christine Reddy, 30, is a prime example. She lives with her husband, Daniel E. Reddy, 39, and their young children in a 1,300-square foot, three-bedroom 1923 colonial that they bought in 2013 for $382,500. Their house is across from Ms. Reddy’s childhood home, where her family still lives. “I have always enjoyed the strong sense of community,” she said. “Everyone has each other’s back.”
While these characteristics have endured, Tuckahoe is also experiencing changes. “There are new apartment buildings, townhouses and condominium complexes,” said Steven A. Ecklond, Tuckahoe’s mayor.
Among the new construction projects are a 19-unit luxury condominium complex and a 153-room Marriott on Marbledale Avenue, a mostly industrial corridor that was once a quarry. “Developers have realized that if they build it, people will come,” Mr. Ecklond said.
Mr. Ecklond is another Tuckahoe lifer. He lives with his wife, MaryAnne, and son, Dylan, in a house his family has owned for more than 100 years.
Referring to Marbledale Avenue, Mr. Ecklond said he envisions dramatic revitalization. “Now it’s vacant on the weekends,” he said, “but I believe that within 10 years, you’ll see decorative lighting, wider sidewalks and new businesses. People will be walking with their families, stopping into a restaurant or boutique. It will be that type of neighborhood.”

 14 WESTVIEW AVENUE, NO. 703 A one-bedroom, one-bath co-op with 950 square feet in a 1966 mid-rise building, listed at $259,000. 914-552-6938 

What You’ll Find
Most of the village is residential, except for Marbledale Avenue and two downtown areas clustered around Tuckahoe’s Metro-North stations — Tuckahoe, in the southwest corner, and Crestwood, almost a mile north.
Housing options abound. There are about 700 single-family houses, according to Todd Huttunen, Eastchester’s town assessor. They include a mix of colonials, Capes and Tudors, most on small lots along tree-lined and sometimes hilly streets. There are also roughly 550 condo units in eight complexes; nearly 300 co-op apartments in four complexes; and 59 rental apartments buildings.
What You’ll Pay
“The market is hot, hot, hot,” said Philly Scoca, a broker and owner of the Tuckahoe-based Village Realty. “I’m talking same-day multiple offers and sealed bids over asking.”
Data from the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service indicated that on Dec. 15, there were seven single-family houses on the market, ranging from a 1,167-square-foot, 1953 two-bedroom listed at $485,000, to a 4,002-square foot, five-bedroom colonial, built in 1919, for $1.85 million.
In addition to two condo units, four co-ops and two multifamily homes for sale, there were 30 available rental apartments, from a 600-square-foot studio for $1,400 a month, to a 2,000-square-foot four-bedroom for $4,500.
For the 12-month period ending Dec. 15, the median sales price for single-family homes was $688,000, down from $733,250 during the previous 12 months. The median price for condos was $390,000, compared with $427,000; for co-ops, $188,500, versus $210,000. The median monthly rental was $2,650, compared with $2,675 for the previous year.


The Vibe
Tuckahoe is a walking village. Pedestrians frequent the shops and restaurants near the Crestwood station and around Depot Square, at the Tuckahoe station. Steps away from the Tuckahoe station are eateries like the family-owned Roma Restaurant, established in 1931, and the library and adjacent community center.
Recreational strollers can join joggers and bicyclists along the section of the Bronx River Pathway that passes through Tuckahoe.
Residents gather at the Parkway Oval field for village-sponsored celebrations like the annual Easter egg hunt and Fourth of July fireworks. At the Depot Square, there is a farmers’ market held every Sunday from June through November, and other seasonal events, including outdoor film screenings, the St. Pio and Tuckahoe Music festivals, and a holiday-themed Winterfest, hosted by the Generoso Pope Foundation. The foundation’s stately building houses the Westchester Italian Cultural Center, with its roster of Italian-centric programming.
A free trolley runs throughout the village on Fridays and Saturdays. Eastchester is home to the Lake Isle Country Club, which has golf, swimming and tennis and offers discounted rates to Tuckahoe residents.
The Schools
Residents in Tuckahoe’s more densely populated southern half are part of the Tuckahoe Union Free School District, which also serves other portions of Eastchester. About 700 schoolchildren who live in Tuckahoe’s northern half attend Eastchester Union Free School District schools.
Tuckahoe Union Free School District’s 1,172 students go to William E. Cottle for kindergarten through fifth grade; Tuckahoe Middle School for grades six through eight; and Tuckahoe High School. The middle and high schools are attached; the building, constructed in the early 1930s, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Eastchester Union Free School District’s 3,233 students attend Waverly School for kindergarten and first grade, Anne Hutchinson or Greenvale for grades two through five; Eastchester Middle School for grades six through eight; and Eastchester High School.
On 2017 fourth-grade state assessments, 61 percent of the Tuckahoe school district met English standards and 74 percent met math standards. For the Eastchester school district, 68 percent met English standards and 75 percent math. Statewide equivalents were 41 and 43 percent.
For the 2017 graduating class, mean SAT scores for Tuckahoe were 534 in evidence-based reading and writing and 547 in math; for Eastchester, 594 in reading and writing and 596 in math. Statewide equivalents were 530 and 528.
The Commute
Commuters to Manhattan can catch Metro-North’s Harlem line at the Tuckahoe or Crestwood stations. Rush-hour trains to and from Grand Central take 26 to 49 minutes. Monthly fare from both stations is $239.
The History
Beginning in the 1820s and continuing for about a century, Tuckahoe was the site of four quarries that produced marble prized for its hardness, weather resistance and sparkling whiteness. At its peak, the village’s quarrying industry employed hundreds of men, including Irish and Italian immigrants.
Tuckahoe once earned the designation “marble capital of the world.” Among the many buildings constructed with the village’s marble are Brooklyn Borough Hall, the Washington Arch and St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Tuckahoe’s quarrying history is documented in the Mini Marble Museum, housed in Village Hall.
