The 2018 NFL Draft is full of talented quarterback prospects. The class, headlined by UCLA’s Josh Rosen and Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield, also includes the dynamic Lamar Jackson, the dual-threat Sam Darnold, and the prototypical Josh Allen – all quarterbacks who will likely hear their names called in the first round of the draft.
Coincidentally, the Buffalo Bills need a quarterback. The team also has two first-round picks in this year’s draft, hypothetically enough capital to orchestrate a trade up.
However, trading up is not a thought that has crossed general manager Brandon Beane’s mind just yet. While speaking to the media at the Senior Bowl on Tuesday evening, Beane told ESPN’s Mike Rodak that he has yet to “assign a value” to the players at the top of the draft, and thus is unsure if he is willing to trade up for any particular player.
Beane went on to talk about the price that the team would have to pay in order to acquire a top selection.
“That comes with a hefty price to be able to do that from 21 and 22, where we’re at,” Beane said. “We’re not saying we would do that. To go up there, we’d have to really feel good about that.”
Beane isn’t sure if he’s willing to give up the assets necessary to jump to the top of the draft. Fortunately, he has some time to think about it. The 2018 NFL Draft kicks off on April 26.
