F.B.I. investigators gambled in 2013 that letting a C.I.A. officer suspected of spying for China slip out of the United States could help them piece together how Beijing decimated an American spy network.
Nearly five years later, when the former officer made a surprise return to the United States this week, the F.B.I. hurried to arrest him upon arrival.

• Stephen Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, has agreed to be interviewed by investigators working for the special counsel in the Russia investigation.
The deal allows Mr. Bannon to avoid testifying before a grand jury and is a sign that he may be cooperating with the investigation.
Separately, two news reports offer fresh details about Mr. Trump’s rumored sexual relationship with an adult-film actress. Mr. Trump and the actress denied the allegations, Mr. Trump’s lawyer said.

• In Germany, a recent deadly stabbing has become Exhibit A for those arguing that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s migration policy has increased the risk of violent crime.
The murder shows how the debate on migration has reached a new and fevered stage, our Berlin bureau chief writes.
Mrs. Merkel hosted her Austrian conservative counterpart, Sebastian Kurz, in Berlin. Unlike Mrs. Merkel, Mr. Kurz rose to power in part by co-opting much of the far-right’s political agenda.

• Score one for the power of sports.
North and South Korea agreed to have their athletes march together under a “unified Korea” flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics next month. The two nations will also field a joint women’s ice hockey team.
The moves are “the most dramatic gesture of reconciliation between the two nations in a decade,” our veteran Korea correspondent writes. (They also upend U.S. strategy.)

Back Story

Double your money in just 90 days. Better yet, make it 45.
That’s what Charles Ponzi, who died 69 years ago today, promised investors. In the end, Ponzi swindled more than $15 million in 1920, the equivalent of $191 million today.
The trickery earned Ponzi his own namesake scheme, made notorious by Bernard Madoff, who defrauded clients of more than $50 billion. But the original scheme centered on postal notes.
Ponzi took advantage of international postal reply coupons, which allowed postal customers in one country to buy a coupon redeemable for stamps in another country.
Money was invested through Ponzi’s Security Exchange Company with the idea that he would take investors’ dollars, use them to buy foreign postal coupons, convert each coupon into a 5-cent stamp, and convert the stamps into cash.
But Ponzi never invested in the coupons.
Instead, he collected the money and paid off his investors while waiting for another influx of cash to come in. Millions of dollars began arriving every week from working-class people.
Ponzi’s scheme was eventually exposed, and he later died in a charity hospital in Brazil, with only $75 to his name.
