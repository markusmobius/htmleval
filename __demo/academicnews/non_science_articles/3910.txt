Why the U.S. Olympics gymnastics team is all of us
Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story misidentified the number of gold medalists on the uneven bars at the 2015 world championships, and mislabeled Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas’s return as two of 14 female gymnasts to return to a U.S. Olympic team.

The U.S. Olympics women’s gymnastics team looks like America. Curly hair, short hair, round eyes, almond eyes, black, white, Latina. In that black and white group shot taken after the lineup was announced in July they are the embodiment of the Modern American Girl, sculpted muscles, pointed toes and all. 
And it is not just their powerful forms and diverse backgrounds that make these world-class athletes an inspiration for kids watching at home (or adults, for that matter). Each has a spark, a drive, a uniquely Olympic characteristic.
Ahead of the qualifying rounds set for Sunday in Brazil, here's a look at why we'll likely see these young faces on Wheaties boxes and magazine covers soon.
Aly Raisman

Fans can see an athlete’s athlete in Raisman, and a head-down, no nonsense type of commitment. After helping the 2012 team to gold in London, and winning an individual gold on floor and bronze on beam along the way, Raisman took a two-year break. She went to the Golden Globes, competed on Dancing With The Stars, enjoyed the shores of Cape Cod like a normal teenager. Then September 2013 rolled around and she decided she wasn’t quite done.
Her longtime coach Mihai Brestyan told The New York Times that he recalled asking why she wanted to make a comeback: “Is it because you want more sponsors, or more gymnastics?”
Raisman answered, "More gymnastics."
He agreed to help on the condition that she get back into “leotard shape” and show her dedication for a whole year, which of course, she did.
“But that’s why I came back about three years ago because it takes this long to get back into the kind of shape you need to be in in order to do all these routines,” she told USA TODAY Sports.
She credits those long, unglamorous hours of running and strength training with her strong finish at the trials, and her historic position as one of the few women who has made two Olympic teams (she and Gabby Douglas are the first since Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes in 2000, and are two of only 14 American women since the start of the modern games).
It’s that dedication, and work that she and Brestyan did to calm her nerves under pressure, that make her a role model. And a joy to watch. Despite the tinge of anxiety seeing anyone flip above a balance beam, there’s a calm when Raisman comes on screen. Her body language says it all: This girl is not going to fall. 
Gabby Douglas 

In Douglas, fans can see a bit of themselves: A dogged young woman, not quite ingénue, not quite doyen. A persevering wunderkind whose imperfections still occasionally flex even as she stands tall.
Douglas earned her second Olympic berth by the skin of her teeth. During the U.S. women's gymnastics Olympic Trials, the 2012 Olympic champion fell off the beam both nights. She wrapped the two-day gauntlet in seventh place in the all-around, a marked fall from the 2012 trials, during which she posted the highest two-day total.
The pressure is on for her once again and, this time, Douglas knows it.
"I do want to be sharper," said Douglas, who was 16 when she won in London. "When I look at my performances, I’m like, ‘Oo, you’re lagging behind, Gabs.’ The one thing I tell myself is to not get lazy. Nothing is handed to you; you always have to fight for yourself. Personally, I don’t feel as sharp as London, but that’s going to change. Right now, I’m so determined to get back in the gym and be better than before."
As the first U.S. athlete to win both team and all-around gold medals and the first black gymnast to win an individual Olympic gold , Douglas has a reputation to defend. And after a hiatus which saw her publish an autobiography, sign a reality TV deal and attend an awards show or two, Douglas returned seemingly stronger than ever, her body sculpted by the grind of four-to-six-hour trainings in a bid to leave Rio a repeat Olympic all-gold medalist. Still, her form leaves much to be desired and she’ll be pitted against younger competitors.

Even so, the so-called "Flying Squirrel" — who went from homeless as a newborn to an undeniable sports sensation as a teen — continues to display the same resilient spirit that's rendered her our "Shero."
"I feel like through my whole career I’ve had to fight for everything," Douglas said. "I’m used to it by now but at the same time it's like, 'Let’s do it and let’s keep fighting.' That’s me and my demeanor."
Simone Biles 

 The team’s most inspiring backstory — and best chance of winning Rio’s biggest prize — belongs to Simone Biles. The only female gymnast to win three world championships in a row, the 19-year-old is the most decorated female gymnast(14 medals with a record ten golds, four U.S. titles, three world championships) and the favorite to win the all-around competition this year.
Biles was born to a mother addicted to drugs and alcohol, and at the age of two, she and her three siblings were placed in foster care. Her grandparents adopted Biles at age 6, homeschooling her starting in eighth grade. Coming months shy of the age limit for the 2012 Olympics, Biles has since won 14 world championship medals (10 golds), more than any U.S. athlete in history.
But can she overcome the so-called Olympic jinx, that supposedly dooms the chances of reigning world champions of winning gold at the Olympics?
“That’s all the media cares about right now, whether I’m going to break some Olympic jinx that I’ve never even heard of,” Biles told Texas Monthly. “It was never my deal to break that. But I guess I have to now, because you guys said I have to."
Laurie Hernandez 

If Biles is in line to capture America’s attention during the games, then Laurie Hernandez is in line to capture our hearts in her Olympic debut. The youngest member of the team, and first Latina gymnast to compete for the U.S. since 2004, is also one of the most fun to watch. Dubbed the "human emoji," Hernandez has an effervescent personality to go along with her incredibly tumbling passes. Even her Instagram account is a mood elevator, and overall reminiscent of another bubbly American gymnastic: Shawn Johnson.
The two have become friends over the last few weeks, a setup by Hernandez's long-time coach Maggie Haney.
“Being a little girl, looking up to her, and now we’re kind of like, friends,” Hernandez told USA TODAY Sports. “That’s crazy.”
Her style is reminiscent of Johnson's as well -- making those death-defying heights achieved in her skills look easy.
"My sport contains high-flying flips and tricks that could be dangerous, but are done with ease," she told NBC. "There is grace, power and agility used in the sport of gymnastics, and that is why I love it."
Madison Kocian 

Texas' crown jewel, Kocian first lassoed the nation’s attention when she won the uneven bars world title in 2015 — one of four gold medalists.
In a follow-up to her unconventional win, the Dallas native won the uneven bars at the 2012 Olympic trials but ultimately finished an undistinguished eighth in the all-around. Still, Kocian’s status as an event specialist was enough to edge out Ashton Locklear to earn her place on this year’s five-woman team.
It's a position even the reigning uneven bars champion doesn’t take lightly.
Cliché as it may sound, Kocian eats, sleeps and breathes gymnastics — and has since her parents first corralled her in the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy (WOGA) in Plano, Texas, at age 6. The future Bruin currently trains 35 hours a week under coaches Cecile Canqueteau-Landi and Laurent Landi, whom she credits for instilling her with confidence and keeping her positive "through the setbacks." In her, fans can see an unswerving humility and tenacity, a fighter who will not only bounce back but will put the team on her back.
You ladies are going to Rio! 🤗🇺🇸
