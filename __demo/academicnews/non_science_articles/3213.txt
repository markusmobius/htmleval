No. 3 Baylor women win 15th straight, 81-56 over No. 6 Texas
WACO, Texas (AP) — Kristy Wallace scored a career-high 27 points, big posts Kalani Brown and Lauren Cox both had double-doubles and No. 3 Baylor won its 15th straight game by overwhelming No. 6 Texas 81-56 in a matchup of the Big 12's top two teams Thursday night.
Wallace scored nine of her points in a game-turning 28-7 run for the Lady Bears (18-1, 8-0 Big 12), who were in control before the end of the first quarter. That spurt included a 14-4 run over the final 3 1/2 minutes of the first quarter and a 14-3 start to the second quarter.
Brown had 17 points and 11 rebounds, her ninth double-double this season and 21st in her career. Cox had 17 points and 10 rebounds. The 6-foot-7 Brown and 6-4 Cox have combined for 129 points and 83 rebounds the last three games.
Brooke McCarty led Texas (15-4, 6-2) with 16 points on 5-of-19 shooting. Lashann Higgs added 13 points and Ariel Atkins 11.
Texas went the final 3 1/2 minutes of the first quarter without a field goal after a Joyner Holmes layup tied the game at 14-all. Brown's tiebreaking free started the quarter-ending 14-4 run.
BIG PICTURE
Texas: Just 10 days earlier, Texas took No. 1 Connecticut to the wire before falling 75-71 at home. The Longhorns were also coming off a record 51-point win at Texas Tech. But they were only able to tie the game five times in the first 6 1/2 minutes, and never led, before the Lady Bears took over. McCarty and Atkins were a combined 2-of-15 shooting before halftime.
Baylor: After winning their first seven Big 12 games by an average margin of nearly 23 points, this was supposed to be the first significant test for the Lady Bears. They passed it without no problem and have a two-game lead over second-place Texas going into their next game that will mark the halfway mark of the 18-game conference schedule.
REMEMBERING CHAMEKA
There was a video tribute moment of silence before the game Chameka Scott, the player that coach Kim Mulkey called "the heartbeat" of Baylor's first national championship team in 2005. Scott died Sunday from colon cancer that was first discovered in 2015. Members of Scott's family and former Lady Bears teammates attended the game.
UP NEXT
Texas plays four its next six games at home. The Longhorns host Iowa State on Saturday night.
Baylor also faces Top 25 games in its next two games, Sunday at No. 20 West Virginia and back at home next Wednesday against No. 19 Oklahoma State.
