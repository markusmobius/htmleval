Plugs are"in" when it comes to the five candidates for Green Car of the Year.
Five cars that are either plug-ins or come with the option, including one minivan, will compete for the coveted award, which goes to the car deemed the best at moving the world a little closer to environmental friendliness.
The finalists "clearly represent the momentum that electrification is experiencing in the auto industry," said Ron Cogan, publisher of Green Car Journal in a statement. "Electrification is now considered by most automakers an essential technology for current and future high-efficiency models."
With the winner due to be announced at the press preview of the Los Angeles Auto Show next week, here's how the Green Car Journal describes the five contenders:
•BMW 330e iPerformance. BMW's 3 Series sedan now comes in a plug-in hybrid version. While it has an electric-only range of 14 miles on a charge — which would still pay off in daily commuting — it still has performance credentials. It can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 5.9 seconds. And because it has a backup gas engine, it has a long total range.
•Chevrolet Bolt. Not to be confused with the Volt plug-in hybrid, the Bolt will be a modern long-range electric car from a big Detroit maker. It is rated as being capable of 238 miles of electric-only range.

•Chrysler Pacifica. The brand's new minivan will have a plug-in option that will go 30 miles on a charge, yet with its gas engine, will have a total range of 530 miles. It can be recharged in as little as two hours.

•Toyota Prius Prime. The 25 miles of electric-only driving from this plug-in is nearly double the range of the previous version. It has the extra capability, yet looks almost like the standard version of the nation's leading hybrid car.
•Kia Optima. The midsize sedan has a plug-in option that goes right along with its 2-liter, four-cylinder gas engine. The batteries will give it 27 miles of electric-only driving before it reverts back to being a hybrid.
