Arianna Talks Jobs And The Midterm Elections On MSNBC (VIDEO)
Arianna went on MSNBC's The Daily Rundown with Savannah Guthrie this morning to discuss the upcoming midterm elections and the number one issue facing voters this November: jobs.
"Continuing to look at what's happening in the country right now as a left versus right issue is completely obsolete, completely wrong," Arianna said. "People, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, are really hurting."
She went on:
The American public right now us offered absolutely laughable solutions by the Republicans and inadequate solutions by the Democrats. There is an enormous amount more that the administration and congress could have done. They could have brought the sense of urgency that was brought to saving Wall Street to saving Main Street. ... There is an enormous amount that can be done but we are not doing it, and there is absolutely no plan at the moment that is going to get us out of where we are, mired in the mud when it comes to jobs.
