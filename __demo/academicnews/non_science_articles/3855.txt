WASHINGTON (AP) — George Washington University athletic director Patrick Nero is resigning after nearly seven years and will leave the job on Dec. 31.
Monday's announcement of Nero's departure comes 15 months after GW fired men's basketball coach Mike Lonergan following an internal investigation into players' allegations about Lonergan's behavior.
Lonergan was fired in September 2016, and a settlement was reached between him and the university this September.
The school said Monday that deputy athletic director Tanya Vogel will take over as acting AD and will start the search for someone to replace Nero permanently.
Nero was hired in April 2011.
