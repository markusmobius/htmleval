Peyton Manning is an elusive dream for NFL broadcasters

Peyton Manning would be a dream scenario for any network that broadcasts the NFL, and ESPN just happens to have its most recognizable football chair open with Jon Gruden leaving the “Monday Night Football” booth.
“We like Peyton Manning. And we would be foolish not to talk him,” ESPN senior VP events and studio production Stephanie Druley told SI.com this week when asked if the network had spoken to the retired quarterback.
Manning, though, appears in no rush to get to the broadcast booth with this now being the end of his second full season out of the sport and no reports linking him near a media gig. That leaves Matt Hasselbeck as the favorite to replace Gruden after he left to coach the Raiders this month.
Hasselbeck will call Sunday’s Pro Bowl game alongside Sean McDonough.
“We are considering Matt, for sure,” Druley told the website. “I would not consider the Pro Bowl an audition per se. When we hired Matt a few years ago there were other networks that wanted Matt as a game analyst. I expect Matt to be very good at this and he will certainly be considered.”
