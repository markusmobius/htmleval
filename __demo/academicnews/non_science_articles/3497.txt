Conan the Barbarian rides again in film, games, books
Conan the Barbarian, brought to life more than 25 years ago by now-Calif. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, is once again battling for pop culture relevance.
The '80s films starring Schwarzenegger marked the height of mainstream exposure for Conan, who was created 75 years ago by author Robert E. Howard. Since acquiring licensing rights in 2002, Paradox Entertainment has made deals to get back into print Howard's Conan stories and the Marvel Comics that brought Conan to attention in the '70s.
"The character has depth," Paradox's Fredrik Malmberg says. "We are attracted to him because he is like us. He is not all good; he has a dark side to him."
Now the resurrection of Conan kicks into high gear: 
•A new Conan video game (THQ, $60, for Xbox 360 and PS3) arrives next week; an online role-playing game, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures (Eidos, for PCs), is scheduled to be released in March. "I think Conan has on and off been a success since (Howard's) inception in the '30s, and (in recent years) the license was mismanaged," says Jorgen Tharaldsen of game developer Funcom. "He is the original American fantasy hero."
•Conan the Phenomenon ($29.95), a new 200-page coffee-table book from Dark Horse Comics, has scores of classic images from illustrators such as Frank Frazetta and Boris Vallejo, as well as a detailed history of Conan and of Howard, who died in 1936. "It covers Conan as a pop-culture figure in all these different media over the years," says Dark Horse's Scott Allie.
•Also from Dark Horse: The Savage Sword of Conan, a 542-page collection of the original Marvel Comics magazines, due Dec. 19 ($17.95), as well as continuing reprints of Marvel's original Conan the Barbarian comics and a new monthly series started in 2004. "The (Marvel) comics created the foundation for the movies," Allie says. "We felt it was important to reprint them." 
•A movie, in development by Millennium Films (16 Blocks, The Black Dahlia), is planned for 2009. Malmberg, who is producing, wants to restore Conan to Howard's original noble savage, "a barbarian who is confronted with civilization as his life progresses and (who) has a much stronger moral code than the so-called civilized people."
Conan could be a man for our times, says Jim Littler of pop-culture website ComicBookMovie.com: "Conan is the iconic Barbarian and will have resurgences from now until the end of time."
