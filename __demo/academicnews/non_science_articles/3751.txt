Super Bowl advertising juggernauts have taken over the bracket. Six of the last eight commercials are for either Budweiser or Bud Light. Doritos and Kia fill the final two slots.
That’s not to say there haven’t been plenty of upsets. Bud’s 2008 ad “Dalmatian Trains Clydesdale” is the highest-rated spot left. It’s a No. 3 seed.
One more fun fact: seven of the eight remaining ads feature animals.
Here are this round’s matchups and some insight from USA TODAY’s editorial partner Ad Age:
Region 1:
5. 2011, Bud Light, “Dog Sitter Puts Dogs to Work,” 8.35 vs. 6. 2015, Budweiser, “Lost Dog,” 8.10
2011, Bud Light, “Dog Sitter Puts Dogs to Work,” 8.35

Dogs have a long history of pleasing crowds in Super Bowl ads, and this canine set-up continued the tradition by winning over audiences in 2011. If it’s surprising that there was a tie for the top spot in Ad Meter that year, it’s less surprising that the other winner featured a dog.
2015, Budweiser, “Lost Dog,” 8.10

It was the third year running that the Clydesdales (and their trainer, played by actor Don Jeanes) featured in a Budweiser Super Bowl campaign. According to the Ad Age Super Bowl Ad Archive, seven Clydesdales underwent training for three months to fine-tune their skills for the new ad, and eight puppies—seven females and one male—were featured.
Region 2:
5. 2011, Doritos, “Dog Gets Revenge,” 8.35 vs. 7. 2013, Budweiser, “Horse and Trainer Reunited,” 7.76
2011, Doritos, “Dog Gets Revenge,” 8.35

Doritos’ “Crash the Super Bowl” contest for amateur ad creators notched its second Ad Meter crown in 2011, tying a Bud Light spot that starred some highly intelligent dogs.
27. 2013, Budweiser, “Horse and Trainer Reunited,” 7.76

This minute-long spot depicting the bond between a horse and his trainer was created by Anomaly in New York and directed by Jake Scott, Ridley Scott’s son, according to the Ad Age Super Bowl Ad Archive. The ad was also used to promote Budweiser’s new Twitter account, where the first-ever post asked fans to help name the horse born at the Anheuser-Busch ranch in Missouri and shown in the commercial. The mare was named Hope by popular vote.
Region 3:
5. 2006, Bud Light, “Secret Fridge Stocks Bud Light,” 8.39 vs. 3. 2008, Budweiser, “Dalmatian Trains Clydesdale,” 8.73 vs. 9.04
2006, Bud Light, “Secret Fridge Stocks Bud Light,” 8.39

“Secret Fridge” via DDB Chicago shows a guy trying to hide his Bud Light from his friends—only to expose it to strangers. More than a decade later, some viewers would remember the “Secret Fridge” spot when they saw a 2017 Super Bowl entry from King’s Hawaiian bread called called “False Cabinet,” according to the Ad Age Super Bowl Ad Archive. King’s Hawaiian said the ad was unrelated, a continuation of a campaign in which a mother hides rolls from her baby.
2008, Budweiser, “Dalmatian Trains Clydesdale,” 8.73

This 60-second ad features a wannabe Budweiser Clydesdale training for a spot on the beer wagon team in a Rocky-style montage, aided by a dalmatian of course. The spot was filmed by super-prolific Super Bowl ad director Joe Pytka, whose vast big-game portfolio also includes Bud’s “American Dream,” Pepsi’s “New Can,” and Gatorade’s “23 vs. 39.”
Region 4:
6. 2014, Budweiser, “Puppy Love,” 8.29 vs. 8. 2017, Kia, “Hero’s Journey,” 7.47
2017, Kia, “Hero’s Journey,” 7.47

Kia’s eighth consecutive Super Bowl appearance won the Ad Meter with a send-up of the difficulties in living your principles, the Ad Age Super Bowl Ad Archive notes. “Hero’s Journey,” created by Kia agency of record David & Goliath, stars Melissa McCarthy as an environmentalist whose attempts to save a whale, a tree and a rhinoceros don’t go so well—set to “Holding Out for A Hero,” the 1984 Bonnie Tyler song from Footloose.
2014, Budweiser, “Puppy Love,” 8.29

This commercial brings back the Clydesdale trainer from 2013’s well-received Bud ad. This time he gives up a puppy for adoption instead of a horse for the Bud team. The puppy, however, has other ideas. The ad, created by Anomaly, was the single most-liked Super Bowl spot from 2011 through 2015, according to Ace Metrix research.
