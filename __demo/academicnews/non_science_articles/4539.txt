Bloomberg News
Here are some of the stocks on our radar Tuesday:
The executive in charge of BlackBerry Ltd.’s instant-messaging tool, BBM, has left the company, creating a hole in one of the smartphone company’s core offerings.
Toromont Industries Ltd. posted a fourth-quarter profit of 44 Canadian cents a diluted share, below the 52 Canadian cents analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting. The big Caterpillar heavy-equipment dealer also hiked its quarterly dividend 15%, citing a positive long-term outlook.
Cineplex Inc. said its fourth-quarter profit fell 38%, while revenue climbed just over 8%. Earnings of 32 Canadian cents a share were well below the 48 Canadian cents analysts were expecting.
McCoy Corp. said it expects to report “significantly” lower earnings in the fourth quarter compared with the third, projecting “nominal earnings” or possibly “a small net loss.” The energy-services company attributed the profit warning to factors such as additional costs for certain product-quality issues and costs for new international sales and service centers.
