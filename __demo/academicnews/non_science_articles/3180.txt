Massive black hole 2 billion light-years away yields discovery

Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story incorrectly characterized when PDS 456 was discovered.
Space lovers, take notice of galaxy PDS 456. It's a quasar — a young, bright galaxy that's powered by a supermassive black hole. According to NASA, it is more than 2 billion light-years away from Earth.
Just how bright is this quasar, in a galaxy far, far away? Its mass is 12 billion times that of the sun, and it sustains winds that emit more energy per second than a trillion suns.
Whoa.
And while awareness of the existence of PDS 456 is hardly new, research into the quasar is revealing additional information on how black holes interact with their host galaxies. For the first time, NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope have worked together to prove what astronomers had suspected: that the winds from a black hole blow outward in all directions, creating a spherical shape.
Black holes are defined by NASA as "a region of space having a gravitational field so intense that no matter or radiation can escape it." When matter is pulled into a black hole, it creates energy. By blowing outward in all directions, black holes play a part in regulating what's around them.
"We know black holes in the centers of galaxies can feed on matter, and this process can produce winds. This is thought to regulate the growth of the galaxies," Fiona Harrison, the principal investigator of NuSTAR, said in a NASA news release.
The entire report, "Black hole feedback in the luminous quasar PDS 456," can be found in the February edition of Science Magazine.
