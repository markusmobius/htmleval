36 Hours+ in Reykjavik
NO SET DEPARTURE DATES. YOU CHOOSE WHEN TO TRAVEL.
Reykjavik used to be the place you stopped to change planes on your way to Europe, but now it’s a destination in its own right. Coming back from a crippled economy and a major volcanic eruption, Iceland is welcoming visitors with a new vibe. Its new concert hall won the prestigious Mies van der Rohe Award, the European Union’s top prize for contemporary architecture. New restaurants are embracing fresh local fare, including horse and puffin, and the relatively new club and bar scene attracts locals and hipsters who take advantage of long summer days.
