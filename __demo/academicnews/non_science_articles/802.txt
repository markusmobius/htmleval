Left, Right & Center: Jobless Labor Day, Afghanistan Plans, ObamaCare, and Back-to-School
Arianna says it's not just subprime mortgage holders who are losing homes; the middle class is desperate and the Obama administration is supporting Wall Street, not the middle class. Tony says we've lost 3 million jobs, as many as were created in the prior decade, and creating public sector work isn't going to provide enough and sustainable new jobs. Bob says the economy should have been Obama's priority all along. Matt says it no longer feels like we've fallen off a cliff and thinks the worst may be over. 
New Afghan plans need a major commitment to get the job done -- but what does "done" mean, and what's the job? Obama is losing support from all sides on this one. 
Health care: will it be one-party legislation? Will it be so watered down it's not really reform? Does there have to be a public option or not? 
And Back-to-School: Does Obama want to turn your child into a communist?
