Laverne Cox Pays Tribute To Iconic Black Women In Beautiful Magazine Spread
She never ceases to amaze us.
We’re only a short month-and-a-half away from Laverne Cox sharing her interpretation of Dr. Frank-N-Furter with the world in the revamp of “Rocky Horror Picture Show.”
As we continue the contdown, Cox has surprised us with a new spread in Cosmopolitan where she pays tribute to three iconic black women: Tina Turner, Tracey Africa and ― of course ― Beyoncé.
In Cox’s accompanying interview, she describes how she was inspired by each of the three women ― including historic black trans woman Tracey Africa, the first openly transgender African-American model.
Check out the photos and her words below, courtesy of Cosmopolitan.

 “The pain, pleasure, and agony of all she’s been through is in her voice. Her story is the story of so many black women who’ve endured abuse and come out the other side in such a brilliant, beautiful way."
 
 
 Tracey Africa

 “She was a black trans woman who modeled in the ’70s and had cosmetics deals and a hair con­tract with Clairol—it was a big deal. People think, ‘Oh, this trans revolution is just start­ing,’ but we’ve been around for a very long time. It’s important to know that there’s been a path blazed for me.”
 
 
 Beyoncé

 “Beyoncé represents excellence. Her work ethic is like nobody else I’ve ever seen. There were so many moments when I was shooting Rocky Horror and I’d be exhausted. My body would be hurting and I’d be like, ‘Beyoncé. Beyoncé does this.’ You have to just put in the work.”
