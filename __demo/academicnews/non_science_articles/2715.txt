Former big leaguer, coach Rob Picciolo dies at 64
SAN DIEGO (AP) — Rob Picciolo, a former major league infielder who later coached with the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Angels, has died. He was 64.
He died Monday of a heart attack.
Picciolo played for the Athletics, Angels and Brewers during a nine-year big league career. He spent 20 years in the Padres organization. He was a minor league manager and spent nearly 16 seasons on the big league coaching staff under three managers.
The Padres said Picciolo "dedicated a decade and a half to our organization and was a tremendous asset as a coach, but more significantly as a person."
He was on the Angels staff from 2010-13.
