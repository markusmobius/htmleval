Stracciatella With Spinach Recipe
Ingredients
 1 ½ quarts chicken or turkey stock 
 Salt 
 freshly ground pepper to taste 
 2 large or extra large eggs 
 1 ½ tablespoons semolina 
 ⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan (1 1/2 ounces) 
 1 6-ounce bag baby spinach, or 1 bunch spinach, stemmed, washed, dried and coarsely chopped 
Preparation
Place the stock in a large saucepan or soup pot. Remove 1/3 cup and set aside. Bring the rest to a simmer. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. If there is any visible fat, skim it away.
Beat the eggs in a bowl, and stir in the 1/3 cup of stock, the semolina and the cheese.
Stir the spinach into the simmering stock, then drizzle in the egg mixture, scraping all of it in with a rubber spatula. Stir very slowly with the spatula, paddling it back and forth until the little “rags” form. Taste, adjust seasoning and serve at once.
 Tip 
Advance preparation: The stock can be made months ahead and then frozen, or four days ahead and then refrigerated. Martha Rose Shulman can be reached at martha-rose-shulman.com.
