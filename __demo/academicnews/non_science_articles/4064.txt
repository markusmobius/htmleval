Susannah Locke
Editor, Special Projects
 Susannah is an original Vox.com staffer. Previously, she was a science reporter here and an editor for five years over at Popular Science. She's also had stints at Scientific American and Discover magazines and once worked as a neuroscientist. She's pretty sure that robots will take over someday, and she hopes they'll be nice.
