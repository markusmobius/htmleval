Florida police are searching for a burglar who stole an AR-15 assault rifle with three fully loaded magazines right out of a police car.
He also stole a taser and cartridges, a tactical vest with police markings and a 16-round .45 caliber magazine, according to the Miami-area Pembroke Pines Police Department.
Surveillance video shows the suspect stealing from a marked Opa Locka Police Department patrol vehicle.
In the video, the man walks up to the car, opens the unlocked passenger door and begins taking equipment.
“We believe this suspect is responsible for additional vehicle burglaries which occurred in the area on the same night,” the department said in a statement.
Police describe the suspect as a light-skinned black or Hispanic male, roughly 5-foot-10 and 160 pounds, with a full-sleeve tattoo visible on his right arm.
