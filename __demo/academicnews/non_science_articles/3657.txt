Messi, Suarez strike again as Barcelona advances in Copa del Rey
MADRID (AP) — Goals from Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez guided Barcelona to a 2-0 victory against city rival Espanyol on Thursday and a place in the Copa del Rey semifinals.
Barcelona had lost the first leg 1-0 last week, but quickly evened the series when Suarez headed home less than 10 minutes into the match at Camp Nou. Messi scored the goal that secured a 2-1 win on aggregate midway through the first half.
The match marked the debut of new Barcelona signing Philippe Coutinho, who came off the bench in the second half to replace Andres Iniesta.
Coutinho arrived from Liverpool at the beginning of the month but had been sidelined by a right leg muscle injury. The Brazilian playmaker was signed in a transfer worth up to 160 million euros (then $192 million), making him Barcelona's most expensive player ever.
Barcelona has made it to the Copa semifinals eight seasons in a row and won the title for the last three years.
