Add Holland America to the list of cruise lines with a promotion for Wave Season — the period beginning in January when cruise bookings surge. 
The Seattle-based line's View & Verandah offer brings free upgrades when booking select 2018 and 2019 departures as well as other perks. 
As part of the promotion, customers get up to $150 per person in on-board spending credit when booking a seven- to nine-night sailing. Customers booking longer sailings get up to $250 per person in on-board credit. 
In addition, customers booking during the promotion get up to 10% off select shore excursions, and passengers booking a suite get free pre-paid gratuities. 
The offer is available for new bookings only and is not combinable with other Holland America discounts. Cabins must be booked by Feb. 28.
Other cruise lines that have launched Wave Season promotions in recent weeks include Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises. Celebrity is offering discounted cabins and free perks such as prepaid gratuities. Azamara also is touting discounts.
