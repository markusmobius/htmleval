Benedict Cumberbatch meeting Andy Murray is British, polite and adorable
Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this post misidentified Benedict Cumberbatch’s wife, Sophie Hunter.
Is Wimbledon champion Andy Murray in the CumberCollective? Well he may be now.
In addition to winning a prestigious and storied athletic tournament on Sunday, Murray was also lucky enough to meet the one and only Benedict Cumberbatch and his wife Sophie Hunter. And, as you might imagine, it is an exchange so cute, so lovely and so very, very British it just may melt your heart.
First, we learn they are fans of each other. Obviously. Then Cumberbatch is visibly moved while he compliments Murray's performance on the court. Murray asks what Cumberbatch is up to and he says he's shooting new Sherlock episodes. To which Murray pumps his fist. Because he's a stan just like the rest of us. And, like the rest of us, he is very concerned that the new season only has three episodes. Because the world is better with more Sherlock.
You can watch the whole exchange in the video above, and try to be cool like the woman standing behind them, watching history happen in front of her.
