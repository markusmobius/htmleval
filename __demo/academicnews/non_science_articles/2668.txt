Is a trip to Greenland on your bucket list? There's a new way to get there from the United States without stepping on an airplane. 
Princess Cruises has unveiled a new route that will take vacationers from New York to Greenland and back by ship. 
For now, the California-based line only is offering a single departure of the 16-day itinerary: Aug. 19, 2019.
The voyage will take place on the 3,140-passenger Caribbean Princess and feature calls in Nuuk, Qaqortoq and Nanortalik, Greenland. 
The ship also will make several stops in Canada along the way. It'll visit Halifax and Sydney in Nova Scotia as it heads to Greenland and make a call at St. John's in Newfoundland as it returns to New York.
Fares for the trip start at $2,499 per person, based on double occupancy and not including an additional $220 in taxes, fees and port expenses. 
The Greenland sailing is one of 16 cruises on three ships that Princess recently announced for the fall of 2019 that include stops in Canada and New England. 
The sailings include seven-day trips to Canada and New England out of New York on the line's 3,600-passenger Regal Princess and 10-day Canada and New England voyages between Quebec City and New York on Caribbean Princess.
