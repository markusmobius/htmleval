Kale and Red Cabbage Slaw With Walnuts Recipe
Ingredients
 4 cups stemmed, slivered curly kale 
 Salt to taste 
 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 
 3 cups finely sliced or shredded red cabbage 
 ¼ cup finely chopped walnuts 
 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar 
 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar 
 2 to 3 teaspoons Dijon mustard (to taste) 
 1 small garlic clove, minced or puréed (optional) 
 1 tablespoon walnut oil 
 ¼ cup plain yogurt 
 Freshly ground pepper 
Preparation
Place the slivered kale in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Toss together and massage the leaves with your hands for about 3 minutes. The kale will lose some volume.
Add the cabbage and walnuts to the kale and toss together.
In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the rice vinegar, sherry vinegar, Dijon mustard, optional garlic, walnut oil, yogurt and salt and pepper to taste. Whisk together and toss with the salad. Taste and adjust seasonings. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or longer before serving. Toss again and serve.
 Tip 
Advance preparation: The salad keeps well for a day or two in the refrigerator.
