Brandon Weatherspoon is the younger brother of Mississippi State basketball players Quinndary and Nick Weatherspoon. And after Tuesday’s game, he’ll have bragging rights over his older brothers.
He accomplished something neither of them had in high school: Breaking a backboard.
When Weatherspoon went in for a breakaway dunk, the junior Canton guard took the rim down with him as the backboard glass shattered.

 So yeah. @__bloading__ decided to take the rim with him. He said @IAM_QUINN11 and @Nick_Gotti0 have never done it. Score one for the youngest Weatherspoon brother. pic.twitter.com/nDzJCjBcKx

That dunk was no joke.
Weatherspoon, who could go on to join his brothers in Starkville, has offers from Georgetown, Tennessee and Southern Miss.
