How the election unfolded
A wave of disillusionment and anger — wide and by all appearances intensely felt — secured the presidency Tuesday for Donald Trump.



 A wave of disillusionment and anger — wide and by all appearances intensely felt — secured the presidency Tuesday for Donald Trump. He won by turning out victories in a wide swath of the United States, a base of support broad enough to secure him a strong majority in the Electoral College even though he lost the popular vote.

Republican growth
 He benefited from an eight-year shift toward the Republican Party. Comparing the margin of victory to the 2012 election, we can see that Trump outperformed Mitt Romney heavily in large portions of the country. The places where Hillary Clinton improved on President Obama’s 2012 numbers, while often populous, were insufficient to give her the votes to clinch victory in battleground states.

 Looking back even further, compared to the 2008 election, this trend is even more pronounced, as many counties, even traditionally liberal ones, have moved significantly to the right over the past 8 years. This map shows how Trump improved on John McCain's margins in 2008.
