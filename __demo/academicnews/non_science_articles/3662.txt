 The tarp is finally lifted off the full-scale X-wing model which has been parked on Hollywood Blvd all week. 
Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this report gave an incorrect release year for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The movie arrived in theaters in 2015.
LOS ANGELES — An X-wing landed in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard. And by "landed," we mean it was shipped from the U.K. in containers that were unloaded by a 500-ton crane and assembled over three days.
Ahead of the premiere of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Saturday, the vehicle that appears in the movie was parked outside of Pantages Theater. It blocked traffic and was covered in blue tarp before becoming a photo-op for cast members and fans heading into the screening.
Chas Jellis, a manager in Pinewood Studio's action vehicle department that handles Rogue One and the next two Star Wars movies, said at the Rogue One premiere that the new starfighter is meant to resemble the original X-wings from 1977's Star Wars, but look "100% better, (because) those were rubbish back then." The specific X-wing on display required one year of planning and construction, including six months spent working just to make the dials and switches in the cockpit operational. Eagle-eyed Star Wars fans will notice that the Rogue One model, with its twin engines, differs from those single-engined X-wings featured in 2015's The Force Awakens, which is set after Rogue One.

Rogue One, the first standalone Star Wars movie, opens Friday; previews start Thursday night.
