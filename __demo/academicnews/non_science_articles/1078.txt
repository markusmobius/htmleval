1. You are stronger than you think.
2. Every run is different. You can run the same loop at the same time two days in a row and feel like the queen of the world one day and the scum of the earth the next. It doesn't say anything about you as a person — except that you're normal.
3. There is a fine line between being in pain and being injured. You have to learn where your line is and when to stop.
4. Take rest days.
5. There's something magical and indescribable about a comfortable pace and a good playlist.
6. The runner's high is real, and once you've experienced it, there's no turning back.
7. It's perfectly acceptable to skip happy hour because you were really looking forward to that evening (or tomorrow's early-morning) run.
8. Sometimes cheering for a runner is even better than running.
9. Fancy gadgets and gear are fun, but they don't make you a runner.
10. Running a "real race" is not a prerequisite to calling yourself a runner. But don't be intimidated to try one.
11. Running is all about you. You determine your own goals. For some, that's a marathon. For others, it's making it around the block.
12. Focusing on the horizon can make each step in front of you feel easier.
13. There are meditative powers in clearing your mind and focusing on your breath or the sound of your feet.
14. The best way to explore a new city or learn a new route is on foot.
15. Running is a common denominator. Runners always have something to talk about together.
16. Sometimes the only thing holding you back is your own mind.
