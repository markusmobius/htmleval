Sepang International Circuit: Verstappen makes more history – Max Verstappen celebrates after a superb victory at the Malaysian Grand Prix.

Copenhagen GP plan gets F1 boss' backing
Denmark has never hosted an F1 race
 (CNN)
It is known for a love of two-wheeled pedal power, but could Copenhagen be on the brink of welcoming the world's fastest race cars to its streets? 
That's what a Danish consortium are hoping after getting an enthusiastic thumbs up from Formula One boss Chase Carey for their proposal to stage a Copenhagen Grand Prix. 
Carey, who paid a visit to the Danish capital, Wednesday, said he was "excited" about the prospect.
"We're excited about the opportunity to explore a potential race here in Denmark ... I think Copenhagen represents the type of location that we think can really provide a great platform," Carey told journalists in Copenhagen, Reuters reported. 
"Scandinavia has been a great part of our sport and having local drivers is always a plus," Carey added.
