Left, Right and Center : 700 Billion Bailout, Obama/McCain Debate, Palin on Katie Couric
This week, Matt, Bob, and Arianna discuss what the bail out plan includes and what it's missing (homeowner bail outs, according to Bob), while Tony isn't so sure a bail out is a productive solution. Once again, the four discuss whether or not the crisis was caused by deregulation, with Tony stating that deregulation peaked during the Clinton years. As for tonight's debate, Arianna would like the Democrats to take on the wider debate of the role of government in a modern economy. Matt smells a potential landslide for the Democrats in tonight's debate owing to the financial crisis, Palin's poor appearance on Katie Couric, and Obama's cool demeanor.
