1/16/2016 – Myrtle Beach, South Carolina
More than 200 patriots gathered throughout the night at the Barrel Sports Bar in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina following the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention. The conservative crowd joined Breitbart News’s Political Editor, Matthew Boyle, as well as reporters, Michelle Fields and Alex Swoyer, to discuss the 2016 presidential election.
The in-depth Q and A covered the mainstream media and methods by which to combat the left’s narratives as the 2016 race unfolds.
Boyle said, “The crowd that came out was absolutely amazing. More than 200 hundred people came out and showed they’re concerned about the direction of their country, and the failure of the institution of the mainstream media to do anything about it. This year is about big picture ideas and a paradigm shift in the political process–and the sophisticated Breitbart News readers who came out to The Barrel Bar here reflected that.”
One of the attendees, Ann Ubelis, who hosts Southern Sense Talk Radio, said, “I thought it was absolutely awesome – so many people, so many patriots and just good fun!”
Other Breitbart contributors in attendance included Sonnie Johnson and AWR Hawkins.
