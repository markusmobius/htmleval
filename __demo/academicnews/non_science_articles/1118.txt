Not too long ago, Tiger Woods was the biggest name in golf and the best player in the world. Today, he can’t even get in a group photo. 
Woods is not playing in the Ryder Cup, but he is serving as a vice captain for the U.S. team. When Woods tried to get into the group portrait, he was unceremoniously shooed away. 
Either misunderstanding the order or playfully trying to slip back in, Woods then worked his way into the group on the other side. According to a clip posted by Golf Channel, he was again told to scram.
Everyone, including Woods, laughed. 
”I forgot I wasn’t playing,” Woods joked afterward, per Golf.com.
He was allowed to appear in the larger group picture that included players and vice-captains:

Woods won 14 golf majors in his storied career, second only to the 18 won by Jack Nicklaus. However, Woods' career was derailed both on the course and off, and he hasn’t won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open. 
Sidelined by back injuries, the onetime number one player in the world is currently ranked 754th by the PGA. However, he is preparing to return to action, Fox Sports reported, and will compete next month in the Safeway Open, which kicks off the new PGA season.
