Outdoor Yoga, Where to Go for the Flow
Summer is in full swing, and that means everything from workouts to weddings have been moved outdoors. So why not do the same with your yoga practice? As a follow-up to 5 Reasons to Take Your Practice Outdoors, here is a list of open-air yoga classes offered across the country. From beaches to rooftops, the options are as varied as the practice itself. Slather on the sunscreen, grab your mat, and let's flow!
