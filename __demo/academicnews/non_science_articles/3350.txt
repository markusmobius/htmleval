 SportsPulse: While All-Star captains Lebron James and Steph Curry are entitled to draft their teams however they want, USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick and Jeff Zillgitt have their own thoughts. USA TODAY Sports

The results of the NBA's inaugural All-Star draft were announced Thursday night, revealing that Kyrie Irving and LeBron James will be teammates again — if only for one game.
James and Stephen Curry, the leading fan vote-getters from the Eastern and Western Conference and therefore the team captains for next month's All-Star Game, drafted their teammates, regardless of conference affiliation, on a private conference call Thursday afternoon. 
James had the first pick while Curry chose which color his team will wear for the league's annual event, which will take place in Los Angeles at Staples Center on Feb. 18.
The full rosters are below.
Team Curry
James Harden
DeMar DeRozan
Giannis Antetokounmpo
Joel Embiid
Damian Lillard
Jimmy Butler
Draymond Green
Kyle Lowry
Klay Thompson
Karl-Anthony Towns
Al Horford
Much to the chagrin of many of the league's players and fans, the draft wasn't televised and the order of the picks weren't made public — though that may change soon.
"We’ve had a lot of discussion around that, and obviously there’s a lot of people in favor of watching (the selections) live, and there’s also people that understand the reasoning behind why it’s not this year,” Curry said this week. “I’m sure as this new format unfolds, year after year, that’ll happen, but it won’t be this first time.
“This is a new format. It’s been a certain way for so long … we’ve still got training wheels on it and we’ll figure out how to make it better from here.”
The first eight picks of the draft came from the pool of players voted in as starters (via fans, players and select media members) followed by 14 picks from the pool of reserves (via NBA coaches).
