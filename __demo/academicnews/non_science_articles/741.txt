Michelle Obama Goes On A Hugging Spree At The Invictus Games
Just ask Prince Harry and Morgan Freeman.
Michelle Obama and Prince Harry put their "differences" aside in Orlando Sunday to kick off the Invictus Games, a five-day sporting event for wounded servicemen and women that Harry launched in the U.K. in 2014. 
It was a joyous occasion, complete with an appearance from world's most lovable narrator, Morgan Freeman. So, what happens when you put Michelle Obama, wearing a BCBG top, in a happy, inspiring, and touching situation? Hugging. A lot of hugging. 
Yes, the first lady has a penchant for embrace. Just ask her daughters, any child she has ever met, and even the seemingly un-huggable Queen Elizabeth II. 
She loved up Freeman at the event:

Can we get in there?

And some adorable kids, too:

TOO. CUTE.

But no hug was as charming as the one she gave her dear friend, Prince Harry. 

"Come to FLOTUS."

So many hugs for Prince Harry. 

Squad goals.

Praise these BHFFs (best hugging friends forever).
