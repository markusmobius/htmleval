At least 26 people were killed and 31 others injured in two explosions outside a mosque in Benghazi, Libya, a security official told CNN.
The explosions, believed to be car bombs, happened in the city's east as worshipers left the Al-Radhwan mosque, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Local media said Benghazi authorities were urging residents in the Al-Salmani al-Sharqi neighborhood to assist authorities in finding the perpetrators.
Libya has been hit with a string of attacks since its civil war broke out in 2011 with the Arab Spring.
