Recovered altar boy from the south. Brooklyn resident since 2006. Moved to New York City from New Orleans to attend the School of Visual Arts. Fine Artist turned Filmmaker, but canvases and cameras are both my weapons of choice. Came out of the closet at the ripe age of 23. Have been trying to balance my personal integrity vs. a healthy relationship with the south ever since. ...I also really love hot sauce.
