Bob Costas on why he's out on Super Bowl coverage

Here's a bit of a Super Bowl surprise: Bob Costas won't be on NBC's broadcast of the Patriots-Eagles matchup.
There was speculation that Costas's recent comments at the University of Maryland - back in November, he said at a roundtable that "this game destroys people's brains" - got him taken off the network's coverage.
But in an email to Sports Business Daily, Costas said the decision to leave him out was mutual:
"The decision was mutually agreeable, and not only do I not have a problem with it, I am actually happy about it. I have long had ambivalent feelings about football, so at this point, it's better to leave the hosting to those who are more enthusiastic about it."
As Costas noted, he's been talking about head injuries and football for years, so those comments made in November might not suddenly anger the league or the network:
"I have been making the same points for several years, often on NBC. In halftime commentaries, interviews with Roger Goodell and other prominent NFL figures, appearances on CNN and elsewhere, I have addressed the issue of football and its undeniable connection to brain trauma many times. Why? Because the evidence is overwhelming and the effects are often devastating. It's the elephant in the stadium at every game whether others choose to acknowledge it or not. And it's not going away. So the idea that I am only now finding my voice on this, or that NBC was taken aback by what I said at Maryland is just wrong. It's all simple and straightforward."
