Happy anniversary to Walter and Lisette Kimmel. The pair married on Aug. 18, 1940 and both are 100 years old.
The couple, who met when they were 22, celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary Tuesday at Charlestown Retirement Community. They live at the community located in Catonsville, Md.
The centenarians marked the occasion with a party featuring big band music and a personalized cake from a local bakery, Mel Tansill, a spokesman for the retirement community, told USA TODAY Network in an email.
The party started at exactly 2 p.m., the same time the pair married 75 years ago, according to Tansill.

The Kimmels met at Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Baltimore. Lisette played the organ and Walter sang in the choir.
"After church one day he came up to her to make their first date," Tansill wrote. "It was custom for boys to sit on one side of the church and girls on the other."
Walter worked at Baltimore Gas & Electric and Lisette was a secretary. The Kimmels have two sons, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
