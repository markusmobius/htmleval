A dramatic video is making the rounds on the Internet that shows the rescue of a toddler from rubble in Aleppo, Syria.
Cries of "Allahu akbar," which means "God is great," can be heard as the little boy is pulled alive from underneath the rubble.
The video was uploaded to YouTube by Syrian activists who oppose the regime of Bashar al-Assad, according to the Metro news organization in England.
The child is unconscious at first but then wakes and is seen rubbing dust from his eyes.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 10 people died in the Wednesday bombing aimed at a bus garage. Two children were among the dead.
