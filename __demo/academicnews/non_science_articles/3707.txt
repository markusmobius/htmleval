Washington St LB Pelluer gets another year of eligibility
PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) — Washington State linebacker Peyton Pelluer has been granted a sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA.
Pelluer started the first three games of last season but missed the final 10 with a foot injury. The senior has made 34 starts and has 254 tackles the past four seasons.
He was injured in WSU's victory over Oregon State in September.
Because the injury occurred so early, Pelluer was eligible to petition the NCAA for a medical redshirt waiver to get an extra year of eligibility.
The veteran's return is good news for a team that will have a new defensive coordinator next season and has to replace numerous defensive starters.
Pelluer already has a bachelor's degree in education and is working toward a master's in teaching.
