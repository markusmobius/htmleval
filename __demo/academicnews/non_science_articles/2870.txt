USA examines infamous feud between Notorious B.I.G., Tupac and their 'Unsolved' murders
PASADENA, Calif. — Christopher "Biggie Smalls" Wallace, aka Notorious B.I.G., inspired Wavyy Jonez to become a hip-hop artist. Now, he gets to play the late rap star in USA's Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and The Notorious B.I.G. (Feb. 27). 
At a winter TV press tour panel Tuesday, Jonez called the killings of the two hip-hop legends, Tupac Shakur (Marcc Rose) in 1996 and Wallace in 1997, "a tragedy." 
Jonez, an acting newcomer producers spotted via social media, said he could relate to Wallace's life as a New York hip-hop artist. He reflected on "the things he went through chasing (his) dream, becoming so massive and then to lose your life like that, it's a tragedy."
Rose, who made his big-screen debut playing Tupac in 2015's Straight Outta Compton, said he learned more about the person in researching for the role.

"I'm used to seeing him as an artist and not knowing why he did certain things. Digging deep into (research), I was able to see we relate in so many ways," including a passionate pursuit of their goals, said Rose, who met Tupac's brother and mother.
Unsolved, which could explore other crimes in future installments, looks at separate investigations into Tupac's murder, one that started in 1996 and another from 2007, one led by Detective Russell Poole (Jimmi Simpson) and the other by Detective Greg Kading (Josh Duhamel).

The program also looks at the friendship between Tupac and Wallace that existed before their failing out.
"It meant a lot to me to go back and try to find what could have disconnected these two," Jonez said. "I wanted to go back and find out who Christopher Wallace was, not just The Notorious B.I.G."
