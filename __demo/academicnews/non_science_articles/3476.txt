31-year-old wrestler Eric Arndt, who until Tuesday worked for WWE as Enzo Amore, issued a statement from his legal counsel Tuesday evening.
Arndt was accused of sexual assault by a woman on Twitter earlier this week, which led WWE to initially suspend and later release him from the company. The alleged assault occurred last October, and the Phoenix police department has confirmed that Arndt is the subject of an investigation.
In his statement, Arndt “fully and unequivocally denies” all accusations.

Arndt’s character, Enzo Amore, had been the focus of WWE’s 205 Live program, as he was the current Cruiserweight Champion. WWE’s Daniel Bryan announced on Tuesday night’s episode of 205 Live that the fate of the now vacant title will be announced next week.
