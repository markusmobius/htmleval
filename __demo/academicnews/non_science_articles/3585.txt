The Cleveland Browns rounded out the coaching staff by hiring Freddie Kitchens as the new running backs coach. He replaces Kirby Wilson, who was let go last week by new Browns GM John Dorsey.
Kitchens is a veteran NFL coach who has spent the last 11 years with the Arizona Cardinals. He was only the RB coach for one season after serving as the quarterbacks coach for four seasons and also the tight ends coach for six.
From the Browns press release of his hiring emailed to the Browns media,
“I am so excited to be joining an historic franchise such as the Browns that has demonstrated a willingness and desire to compete for championships,” said Kitchens. “I look forward to the opportunity to work with Hue, John and the whole organization, while we work together to achieve the desired success.”
