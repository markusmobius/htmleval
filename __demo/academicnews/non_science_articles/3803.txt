A shipyard in Europe on Tuesday officially began construction of another giant cruise ship for Royal Caribbean. 
The massive Meyer Werft shipbuilding facility in Papenburg, Germany held a steel-cutting ceremony to mark the beginning of work on Royal Caribbean's new "Quantum Ultra" ship — a new version of the Miam-based line's recent Quantum Class vessels. 
A tradition at some shipyards, steel-cutting ceremonies celebrate the cutting of the first piece of steel for a new vessel. 
As part of the event, Royal Caribbean also revealed the new ship would be called Spectrum of the Seas. 
Scheduled to debut in 2019, the new vessel is being specifically designed for the China and Asia-Pacific region. 
Royal Caribbean hasn't said whether the new ship will be bigger than the line's three existing Quantum Class vessels. But in a press release issued Tuesday it said Spectrum of the Seas would represent an evolution of the class. 
"Spectrum will be another giant leap forward in vessel design and guest experiences that will provide travelers with ample opportunities to create unforgettable memories," Royal Caribbean president and CEO Michael Bayley was quoted as saying in the press release. 
Measuring 168,666 tons a piece, Royal Caribbean's three Quantum Class ships are tied as the fifth largest cruise vessels in the world.
