Now you can have your very own Vox t-shirt or sweatshirt.
Ask and you shall receive.
They're not quite in time for the holidays, but they're pretty close. After Ezra Klein took the Ice Bucket challenge in a Vox shirt, a number of you wanted one too (preferably a dry one). We're happy to finally offer two shirts and a sweatshirt — in both men's and women's fit — featuring the Vox logo and a snazzy highlighter yellow strikethrough. They won't ship until January, but we think you'll like them as much as we do.


This is a limited-time printing, and it will be available until December 22 at 2:00PM EST — so don't wait to order.
