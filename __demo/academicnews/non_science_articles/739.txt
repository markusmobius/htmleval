Williams regularly shares pictures and videos of Olympia, her first child with husband Alexis Ohanian. In a recent interview with Vogue, she opened up about ups and downs she’s faced in motherhood. 
“Sometimes I get really down and feel like, man, I can’t do this,” she revealed. “It’s that same negative attitude I have on the court sometimes. I guess that’s just who I am. No one talks about the low moments ― the pressure you feel, the incredible letdown every time you hear the baby cry.” 
Williams added, “I’ve broken down I don’t know how many times. Or I’ll get angry about the crying, then sad about being angry, and then guilty, like, why do I feel so sad when I have a beautiful baby? The emotions are insane.” 
Williams sits on the board of advisers to Oath, HuffPost’s parent company.
