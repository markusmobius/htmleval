The draft was not televised, but James and Curry spoke to Ernie Johnson in an interview on NBA on TNT about the process and their picks. While the two stars repeatedly refused to reveal who they selected first (though we all know it had to be Kevin Durant), they did share what they thought of their final squads.
When Johnson asked James about his selections, especially the fact that he chose his former Cavs teammate Kyrie Irving, James said:
“I just tried to pick the best available players, and to be able to team back up with Kyrie, it’s always special, along with Kevin Love. For us to have another weekend to bring back some of the memories we had when we were all together. Kyrie was available on the draft board. He’s one of the best point guards that we have in our league, so it was an easy choice for me.
“It was important to have my teammate (Love) alongside me. It’s a great weekend, we get to share another All-Star moment.”

James continued:
“I got a lot of chemistry with my four and five, AD and Boogie. Me and Kyrie got some history and some chemistry as well, and I think Kevin Durant can fit in any system in the world — his ability to do what he do. I got a 7-foot guy playing a two-guard in Kevin Durant, so we got a real good chance.”

James and Curry also said that they believe the draft should have been televised, and hopefully it will be in the near future — like next year.
