Ravens player Humphrey accused of stealing $15 phone charger
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Baltimore Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey has been arrested on a charge of stealing a phone charging cord from an Uber driver.
Court records show the former Alabama player was arrested Thursday on a third-degree robbery charge in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
The 21-year-old Humphrey is free on bond after being held briefly.
The Tuscaloosa News reports that records show an Uber driver claimed Humphrey borrowed a $15 charger on a pre-dawn ride to a University of Alabama campus hotel on Jan. 13 but refused to return it.
A charging document says Humphrey elbowed the driver and balled up a fist.
A Ravens statement says Humphrey told the team there was a misunderstanding over a phone charger he thought was his.
An attorney representing Humphrey didn't immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
