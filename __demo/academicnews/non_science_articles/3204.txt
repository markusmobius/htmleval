In one quick instant, Johnny Manziel went from possibly starting a football comeback to a footnote in Vince McMahon’s new XFL.
The former Cleveland Browns quarterback started tweeting about McMahon bringing back the football league that made headlines for one crazy season in 2001, and it sounded like he wanted in:
 #XFL2020 @VinceMcMahon

He also joked about ESPN’s Darren Rovell being called “Dan” on the air:
 #DanRovell booom…roasted

And then, during McMahon’s initial press conference about the league coming back, he revealed a wrinkle about who would be eligible: Anyone with a criminal record would be ineligible.
More from McMahon in an interview he did with ESPN’s Dan Darren Rovell:
“We are evaluating a player based on many things, including the quality of human being they are,” McMahon said. “If you have any sort of criminal record or commit a crime you aren’t playing in this league.”
Manziel pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in 2013 after being arrested in 2012 and eventually had an assault charge dropped last year after, as USA TODAY Sports wrote, he “met the terms of a conditional dismissal agreement.” It seems like the former would make him ineligible.
