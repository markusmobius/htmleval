WASHINGTON - The productivity of American workers rose in the July-September quarter at the fastest pace in two years, while labor costs slowed.
The Labor Department says that productivity increased at a 3.1% rate in the third quarter, a significant improvement from the previous three quarters when productivity had fallen. Unit labor costs edged up a modest 0.3% in the third quarter, compared to a 3.9% jump in the second quarter.
The rise in productivity was the best showing since a 4.2% gain in the third quarter of 2014. But the rebound was expected to be only a temporary improvement from a worrying broader trend of weak productivity gains since the 2007-2009 recession. Strong gains in productivity are needed to boost Americans’ living standards.
In a separate report, more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but jobless claims remain at levels that suggest most workers enjoy job security.
The Labor Department says claims for unemployment aid rose by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000, highest since early August. Still, claims came in below 300,000 for the 87th straight week, longest such streak since 1970 when the workforce was much smaller.
The less-volatile four-week average rose 4,750 to 257,750.
Overall, 2.03 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks, fewest since June 2000 and down more than 7 percent from a year earlier.
Applications for jobless aid are a proxy for layoffs, and most employers have been holding onto staff. The unemployment rate was 5 percent in September, close to what economists consider full employment.
