 Amira's father was a member of the celebrated Syrian Civil Defense volunteer rescue group, also known as the White Helmets. 
 He was killed five months ago while on a rescue; now Amira lives with her mother and grandparents. 
 While Amira is just a year and a half old, her family says she remembers what her father looked like.
