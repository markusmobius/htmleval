Trump, Clinton end debate with compliments
CLOSE

 In the final question of the second presidential debate, the candidates were asked what they respected about one another. The responses may surprise you. 
Like a movie with a surprise ending, Sunday night's debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ended on a civil, complimentary note.
After 90 minutes of brutal, often sharply personal attacks, the two candidates were asked by a voter at the town-hall debate to mention something they "respect in one another" in the final question of the night, which drew knowing laughs from the crowd.
Clinton called it "very fair and important" question and cited Trump's children.
“I respect his children," she said. "His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.”
Trump said that was a “very nice compliment” and offered up one of his own.
“She doesn’t quit," he said. "She doesn’t give up, I respect that.”
“She’s a fighter," he added, before noting he disagreed "with much of what she’s fighting for.”
