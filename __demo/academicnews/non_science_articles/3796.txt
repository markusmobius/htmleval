Bristol Palin was well compensated for her work with The Candie's Foundation in 2009. 
The most recent data for The Candie's Foundation that's posted online by research firm GuideStar shows compensation at $262,500 for the now-20-year-old daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee.
Bristol Palin was 18 when she was appointed as a teen ambassador for the New York-based foundation in 2009, months after giving birth to son, Tripp. She and the 2-year-old boy's father are no longer together.
Palin family attorney John Tiemessen and foundation officials did not immediately return calls for comment.
Palin is still listed as an ambassador on the foundation's website. The blog Palingates first reported the compensation figure.
