Florida Confirms Three New Non-Travel Zika Cases
Share
 Three new non-travel cases of the Zika virus have been found in Florida, bringing the number of cases confirmed there so far to 28, health officials said. 
 The mosquito-borne virus can cause microcephaly and other birth defects. "Active transmission" is occurring in a one square mile area of the Wynwood arts neighborhood north of downtown Miami, the Florida Department of Health said. 
 Of the three new cases, two are in that one square mile area but one is outside the area but still in Miami-Dade County, the health department said.

 Health officials still believe that active transmission is only occurring in the area north of Miami. 
 "One case does not mean active transmission is taking place,” the department said of the case outside the one square mile area. 
 "The department still believes active transmissions are only taking place within the identified area that is less than one-square mile in Miami-Dade County," the health department said. 
 Home-grown Zika cases didn't begin showing up until July 29, when the first four were confirmed — the first mosquito-to-human transmissions known to have occurred in the United States. 
 Zika had already spread fast already across Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, central America and the Caribbean.
