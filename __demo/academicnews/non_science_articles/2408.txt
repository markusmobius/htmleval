And finally.... the Dow Jones has continued to ‘melt-up’ with aplomb.
The benchmark US stock index gained another 220 points, or 0.88%, to finish the day at 25,295, which is obviously a new all-time high.
The S&P 500 also hit a new closing high, as Wall Street celebrated its best start to a new year since 2006.
Economic optimism, and predictions that US interest rates won’t be hiked too quickly, helped to push shares higher.
Can the bull market continue next week? Come back on Monday to find out :) Until then, goodnight! GW
Hello again. Marketwatch has an interesting explanation for the market rally:
Investors are feeling good about the U.S. stock market. In fact, they haven’t felt this good in years. 
The latest AAII investor sentiment survey, conducted on Jan. 3., indicates that 59.8% of polled investors are bullish on the market, meaning they expect prices will be higher in six months. That’s the highest level in about seven years, since a reading of 63.3% on Dec. 23, 2010, and it is significantly above the 38.5% historical average. The number of bullish investors has gone up by 7.1 percentage points in the past week alone.
There has been a corresponding drop in both bearish and neutral investors. The percentage of market pessimists has dropped to 15.6%, down 5.1 percentage points over the last week, while neutral investors have slid by 2 percentage points to 24.7%. Both are below their historical averages, which is 30.5% for bears and 31% for neutral investors.
Closing summary: Markets at new highs despite jobs and car sales
OK, time for a recap.
The global stock market rally has driven Britain and America’s stock markets to fresh highs today, despite an underwhelming employment report from the US.
The Dow Jones index has pushed further over the 25,000 mark, while in London the FTSE 100 has closed at a new peak over 7,700.
Shares jumped despite the news that America’s economy didn’t create as many jobs in December as expected. The closely-watched Non-Farm Payroll only rose by 148,000, missing forecasts of a 190,000 gain, while wage growth was unexceptional at 2.5% over the last year.
My colleague Dominic Rushe explains:
The headline numbers suggest that the jobs market remains strong. The labor department announced that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% in December, close to a 17-year low.
The US economy has now added more than 2m jobs a year for seven straight years, a run last seen in the 1990s. But the pace of hiring has slowed, the recovery remains uneven, and wages continue to lag behind growth.
FTSE ends at new alltime peak
Boom! The FTSE 100 has ended the week at a new all-time high.
The blue-chip index of the biggest companies listed in London has closed at 7724 - the first time it has finished over the 7700 mark.
That’s a gain of 28 points, or 0.37%.
Energy provider Centrica and water group United Utilities were the biggest risers, up around 3% after an analyst upgrade.
But insurance group Admiral led the fallers, down 3% after figures showed UK car sales fell last year - and may keep falling in 2018. Fewer new cars means less insurance business.
Other European markets also had a strong day, as the first week of 2018 gets off to a strong start. No wonder analysts are talking about a ‘melt-up’....

Just in: German lender Deutsche Bank says Donald Trump’s tax reform package will cost it €1.5bn.
This makes Deutsche Bank the latest in a string of major companies to announce that their deferred tax assets are less valuable, now that America’s corporation tax rate is being cut from 35% to 21%.
Deutsche also says that weak markets have hit its revenues, meaning it will post a small loss for the fourth quarter of the financial year.
This has sent Deutsche’s shares sliding almost 5%.

It’s slightly ironic, as Deutsche Bank has been a major lender to Donald Trump over the years (a relationship that has come under increasing scrutiny).
MSNBC’s Steve Benen have calculated that US job creation slowed last year - the first 12 months of Donald Trump’s presidency.
Benen writes:
Now that we have data for all of the previous calendar year, we can note that the U.S. added 1.84 million jobs in 2011, 2.19 million jobs in 2012, 2.33 million in 2013, 3.11 million in 2014, 2.74 million in 2015, 2.24 million in 2016, and 2.05 million in 2017.
Or put another way, while Donald Trump’s first year as president has been pretty good overall for job creation, Americans nevertheless saw the slowest job growth in six years.
Steve Benen (@stevebenen)Job growth wasn't bad in Trump's 1st year in office, but it did slow to a six-year low. Job totals by year:
2011: 1.84m
2012: 2.19m
2013: 2.33m
2014: 3.11m
2015: 2.74m
2016: 2.24m
2017: 2.05mhttps://t.co/E8dQJwfiRi
Dow Jones hits another record high
Boom! The US stock market has hit fresh record highs (yet again) at the start of trading in New York.
Traders are shrugging off the news that America’s job creation slowed last month.
The Dow Jones continued its march upwards, gaining 70 points to 25,145. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are also pushing higher, as the bull market shows no inclination to fizzle out.

But while shares rise, the US dollar has dropped.
Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, explains:
“Surprisingly, Wall Street shook off the lower than expected jobs data and rose still higher, although the Dollar fell 0.3% versus the Euro and 0.26% versus the Pound on the news.
“December’s Non-Farm Payrolls data does not fit the current narrative of booming US growth. The initial reaction from the market is to ignore. That could be perilous.
“It’s also possible markets have decided the recent harsh weather contributed to the slowdown in jobs
