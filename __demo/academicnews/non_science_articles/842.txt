Will Foot Fetishists Foot The Bill For NSFW New Toy?
560 
A new sex toy hopes to get a toe hold in the crowded field by putting an imitation female sex organ in a replica of a human foot.
The aptly-named "Vajankle" looks like a human foot made of silicon -- except for the fake vagina on top of the ankle.
The product is the brainchild of Sinthetics, a Los Angeles-based company that specializes in sex dolls that cost more than $6,000 each.
Footing the bill for the "Vajankle" is comparatively cheaper. It's only $179, and a shoppers can customize it in every shade from "cream" to "espresso." They can choose red nail polish, a French manicure or a custom polish on the toes.
