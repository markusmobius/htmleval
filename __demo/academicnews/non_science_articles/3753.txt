College football: Projecting the 2017 records of all 130 FBS teams

 USA TODAY Sports released its projections for all 130 FBS teams and here are some highlights. USA TODAY Sports

There are only two factors preventing an individual team from finishing undefeated in the Football Bowl Subdivision.
One is statistics: The odds of perfection decrease as more games get added to the road to the national championship — and as illustrated by Alabama in 2016, the last game is always the hardest.
The second is history. In the past decade, just four Power Five teams have completed a perfect season: Alabama in 2009, Auburn in 2010, Ohio State in 2012 and Florida State in 2014.
But finishing the regular season unbeaten? Maybe that’s another story.
USA TODAY Sports’ preseason projections for the upcoming regular season finds one team exiting November without a loss: Ohio State, which will be led by a senior quarterback in J.T. Barrett, one of the elite coaches in the sport in Urban Meyer and a top offensive coordinator in Kevin Wilson, who comes over from Indiana with the goal of rebuilding the Buckeyes’ explosive offense.
Though Ohio State is the only unbeaten team in our projections, others will flirt with regular-season perfection. Across the Power Five leagues, we’re pegging another four teams to finish with just one loss: Florida State, Alabama, Wisconsin and Southern California.
The tightest divisional and conference races can be found in the ACC Atlantic, between Florida State and Clemson; in the Big 12, where rivals Oklahoma and Oklahoma State are set for bedlam; between Boise State, Wyoming and Colorado State in the Mountain West’s Mountain Division; and in the Pac-12 North, where Stanford stands to upend Washington’s hope for a repeat.
Here’s the full list of our conference projections:
