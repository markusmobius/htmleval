'Lady Bird,' 'Call Me by Your Name' land GLAAD media nominations
LOS ANGELES — Five feature films including Golden Globe winner Lady Bird and Call Me By Your Name have been nominated for GLAAD Media Awards, one year after it found only two films to honor for gay-inclusive storylines and characters.
The other wide-release films nominated Friday are Battle of the Sexes, The Shape of Water and Professor Marston and the Wonder Women. 
Last year's nomination of only two films by the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender advocacy group was its fewest nominations for major releases since 2003. It is the 29th year GLAAD has bestowed awards for projects that provide "fair, accurate and multi-dimensional" depictions of LGBTQ characters.
GLAAD also nominates work in various other media, including television, music, journalism and comic books. Winner announcements are spread between two ceremonies: April 12 in Los Angeles and May 5 in New York.
Netflix led television nominees with seven nods. The networks ABC, CBS and NBC each received six nominations.
Miley Cyrus, Halsey, Kesha and Sam Smith are among 10 nominees for outstanding music artist.

Jay Z's song and music video Smile, which featured his mother coming out as a lesbian, were singled out for a special honor.
GLAAD is also for the first time honoring children and family shows featuring inclusive programming, announcing nominations for episodes of the Disney Channel's Andi Mack" and Doc McStuffins as well as Amazon's Danger & Eggs, Nickelodeon's The Loud House and Cartoon Network's Steven Universe.
"What people see in the media has a powerful impact on how they treat others and the GLAAD Media Awards raise the bar for media to tell LGBTQ stories that accelerate acceptance," GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis wrote in a statement.
