Chipper Jones spent his entire MLB career with the Atlanta Braves, and, in turn, 19 years tormenting the New York Mets.
New York always liked to troll Chipper — err, Larry — and the Braves star would return the favor in one of the better city-opponent rivalries we’ll see. So, when Jones got the nod for the Hall of Fame on Wednesday, it just wouldn’t have felt right if New York didn’t give Jones the “Larry” treatment for old times’ sake.
This was how the New York Daily News congratulated Jones on his achievement.

“Go to Hall, Larry!”
OK, that was good.
Jones would also take notice to the cover. He was a fan.

“19 years of Met killing” did indeed pay off.
