The New Orleans Saints will have a large contingent of players and coaches at this year’s 2018 NFL Pro Bowl. Right guard Larry Warford will join six other teammates in Orlando, upon replacing Philadelphia Eagles lineman Brandon Brooks after his team’s advancement to Super Bowl LII.
His addition to the NFC roster brings the Saints total number of players to seven, which ties the franchise record for the most participants from the team named to a single Pro Bowl. Warford will suit up alongside quarterback Drew Brees, running back Mark Ingram, RB Alvin Kamara, defensive end Cameron Jordan, wide receiver Michael Thomas and cornerback Marshon Lattimore.
Warford was New Orleans’ top free agent acquisition last year after it made improving the rush offense a top priority. He was signed away from the Detroit Lions, who drafted him in the third-round in 2013 after the big lineman agreed to a four-year, $34 million-dollar contract with the Saints.
He appeared in 14-of-16 regular-season games and started both postseason games for New Orleans. Warford, along with outstanding rookie right tackle Ryan Ramczyk, helped pave the way on the right side of the offensive line and were vital in helping both Ingram and Kamara eclipse 1,500 scrimmage yards. The Saints finished with the fifth-best ground game in the league, averaging 129.4 yards per game.
