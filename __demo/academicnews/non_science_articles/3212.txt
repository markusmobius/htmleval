Here are the senators who served as a clue on Jeopardy
Which senators were a Final Jeopardy clue?





Did you know that the last names of two senators — one from Massachusetts and one from Virginia — are anagrams of each other?
We didn't, either, until Wednesday night, when Jeopardy threw the fact at its contestants in the final round.
The Final Jeopardy clue: "The last names of these 2 current senators, one from Virginia & one from Massachusetts, are anagrams of each other."
So, what's the correct response?
Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mark Warner of Virginia.
No one got the answer right. Two of the contestants identified Warren, but Warner remained a mystery. The third contestant went for the other Virginia Democratic senator, Tim Kaine, and named a Sen. Aiken, who does not currently exist. (The contestant may have been thinking of Sen. George Aiken, a New England senator from Vermont who served from 1941 to 1975.)
But we're not judging: We're not sure we'd be able to think that quickly with the Jeopardy theme song playing, either.
