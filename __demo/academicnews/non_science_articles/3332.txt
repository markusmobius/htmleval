Reds fire manager Dusty Baker
Dusty Baker is out as manager after six seasons with the Reds, a team source has confirmed.
Baker, 64, had a year remaining on his contract. He led the Reds to a 90-win season. They lost in the Wild Card game on Tuesday.
Reds general manager Walt Jocketty said in the aftermath of the 6-2 loss to Pittsburgh Pirates Tuesday that he "thinks" Baker will be back.
Baker was at Great American Ball Park on Wednesday. He did not reply to message left through an Reds employee Thursday.
The final decision Baker was up to owner Bob Castellini. Castellini did not return messages Wednesday or Thursday.
Baker led the Reds to playoffs three of the last four years, but they lost in the first round each year. They year, they closed with a six-game losing streak. He finishes his tenure as Reds manager 509-454.
He is only the Reds manager to lead the team to the postseason more than once. He ranks third on all-time on the Reds win list behind Hall of Famers Sparky Anderson and Bill McKechnie.
POSTSEASON POWER RANKINGS: Who's No. 1?
Baker was named National League Manager of the Year three times, including once with the Reds.
Baker was clearly disappointed this year that the Reds' front office did not provide any help at the trade deadline. The Pirates added outfielder Marlon Byrd and Justin Morneau.
Byrd played in a key role in the season-ending sweep of the Reds and hit a home run to get the scoring started in Tuesday's win.
Baker and Jocketty clashed sometimes on player issues. Baker said this season he had to fight to get top prospect Billy Hamilton added to the roster.
The top in-house candidates to replace Baker are pitching coach Bryan Price and Triple-A manager Jim Riggleman. Riggleman managed Washington Nationals (2009-2011), the Seattle Mariners (2008), the Chicago Cubs (1995-99) and the San Diego Padres (1992-94).

The Reds hired Riggleman as Double-A manager in 2012 after Riggleman walked away from Nationals job in the 2011 in contract dispute.
Baker took over the Reds in 2008 after previously managing the San Francisco Giants and the Chicago Cubs. He was 60th manager in the club history.
Baker led the Reds to a 74-88 record in '08 and a 78-84 record in '09. In 2010, the Reds went 91-71 and National League Central breaking a drought of 10 straight losing season.
The Reds fell back to 79-83 in 2011.
In 2012, the club went 97-64 and won the NL Central again. Baker missed part of September after being hospitalized in Chicago with an irregular heart beat. He later suffered a ministroke. He returned for National League Division Series. The Reds won the first two games of the series, but lost the last three at home to be eliminated.
