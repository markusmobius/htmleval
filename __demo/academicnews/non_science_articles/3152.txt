After missing the entire 2017 season, New York Mets third baseman David Wright admits that he isn't sure what his future holds.
"It really hurts to say this, but I obviously can't be relied on to go out there and do what I've done throughout my career," Wright said Friday, per MLB.com. "That is a tough thing to say."
Wright, a seven-time All-Star, hasn't played in the majors since May 2016 and has appeared in only 75 games total over the past three seasons.

In 2015, Wright was diagnosed with spinal stenosis and missed the majority of the season, but returned in August and played in the postseason as New York reached the World Series. In 2016, Wright had surgery to repair a herniated disc in his neck.
Wright underwent two more operations in 2017, one to repair his rotator cuff and another to remove bone spurs, a ligament and a herniated disc in his lower back.
"The surgeries are obviously serious stuff, but it just kind of plays with your mind mentally, where you don't know how your body's going to hold up," Wright said.
The Mets owe the 35-year-old $47 million over the next three seasons. He is the club's all-time leader in hits, runs and RBI.
"I don't want to have regrets," Wright said. "If I can't play? Then I'll be able to say I gave it my best shot, I really did. And if I can play, which obviously is the goal, then that's great as well. And that's ideal.
"I just don't want to have any regrets when it's all said and done that if I would have just put in some more work, or if I would have just concentrated a little more on the rehab program, I might have been able to do it."
