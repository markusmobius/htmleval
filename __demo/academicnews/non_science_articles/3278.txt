 President Trump's announced ban on transgendered individuals in the military has sparked backlash for Ivanka Trump. Buzz60
Twitter never forgets.
On the same day her father announced a ban on transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, Ivanka Trump is taking heat for a tweet sent more than a month ago expressing her support for the LGBTQ community.
In June, Ivanka Trump tweeted, "I am proud to support my LGBTQ friends and the LGBTQ Americans who have made immense contributions to our society and economy."
The tweet received some initial backlash when Twitter users called Ivanka Trump out for supporting "the most anti-LGBTQ+ presidential ticket in recent times," as one Twitter user put it, adding, "Your words mean nothing to us."
I am proud to support my LGBTQ friends and the LGBTQ Americans who have made immense contributions to our society and economy.

You openly supported and campaigned for the most anti-LGBTQ+ presidential ticket in recent times. Your words mean nothing to us.

After President Trump announced the transgender military ban Wednesday, his daughter's statement faced even more scrutiny for what some saw as hollow words.
Words without actions mean nothing. https://t.co/40WZm0p6N0

Your father is trying to keep trans folk from making immense contributions to our society and economy. You want to be an ally, DO something. https://t.co/k03j1esvbw

President Trump faced backlash of his own for the ban, which was announced on the same day as the anniversary of former president Harry Truman desegregating the armed services, and many active transgender service members expressed dismay over the decision.
