When it comes to his spending, LeBron James has one regret.
Or at least, an easy choice when asked about the worst financial decision he’s made.
He bought a house in Vegas in 2005.
“Oh my god,” he said in an interview with Maverick Carter for the website Uninterrupted.
James said that he decided to make the ill-advised purchase early in his career because his team’s training camp was in Vegas.
“I’m young, I don’t know. I’m having a ball there playing. Also having a good time. I’m 21, 22. My family’s coming out, they love it. Let’s buy a house! Who buys a house in Vegas?” he said, laughing.
His best decision?
“Signing with Nike and getting down with Beats,” he said.
