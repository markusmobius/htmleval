Arianna On 'Situation Room': Don't Bother To Pass Weak Financial Reform (VIDEO)
Arianna appeared on "The Situation Room" Wednesday evening along with CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen to discuss financial reform.
She said that the Senate shouldn't bother to pass a financial reform bill if it weakens the proposed consumer financial protection agency by putting it within the Fed. Arianna accused the White House of wasting time on financial reform in an effort to court GOP votes that could never have been gained. In their push for bipartisan interest, Arianna said that the White House lost control of the narrative on financial reform.
