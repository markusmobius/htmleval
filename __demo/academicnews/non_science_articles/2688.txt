Blue Jackets sign veteran forward Gerbe to 2-way deal
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The Columbus Blue Jackets have signed forward Nathan Gerbe to a one-year, two-way contract.
The 30-year-old last played in the NHL during the 2015-16 season, when he was with Carolina. He has played the last two seasons in Switzerland.
General Manager Jarmo Kekalainen said Wednesday that Gerbe will be placed on waivers for the purpose of assignment to the Cleveland Monsters, Columbus' AHL affiliate.
Gerbe had 58 goals and 80 assists for 138 points in 394 career NHL games with the Buffalo Sabres and Carolina Hurricanes.
He posted four seasons of 25 or more points, including setting career highs with 16 goals and 15 assists in 64 contests with Buffalo in 2010-11.
The Blue Jackets can use the help at forward, with Cam Atkinson, Brandon Dubinsky and Sonny Milano sidelined with injuries.
