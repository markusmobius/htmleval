1.9k Shares 




James Corden and Neil Patrick Harris have a lot in common. They both love Broadway. They've both hosted the Tonys. And they've both won a Tony (although, as NPH will note, Corden's was for a non-singing role). So when these two Broadway bros get together, you just know they're going to sing some showtunes. And if you ever wondered who would win between these two in a Broadway-off, they've happily obliged you.
In a "Broadway riff-off" Harris and Corden trade singing Broadway songs, accompanied by a cappella group The Filharmonic. They go for classic Broadway songs, ballads, sexy songs, and, of course, a song from Hamilton.
Watch the whole performance below.
And in case you're wondering, here are all the songs they cover:
Corden: Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat from Guys & Dolls
Harris: Everything's Coming Up Roses from Gypsy
Harris: Being Alive from Company
Corden: On My Own from Les Miserables
Corden: All That Jazz from Chicago
Harris: Sugar Daddy from Hedwig and the Angry Inch (Harris won a Tony for playing the title role in this musical)
Both: My Shot from Hamilton
