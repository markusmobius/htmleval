Third time's the charm.

Former "Teen Mom"-turned-adult entertainer Farrah Abraham has gone under the knife yet again.
The 24-year-old -- who's already had two breast augmentations in addition to a nose job, and underwent procedures for a chin implant, cheek fillers and several rounds of lip injections -- has now had a third boob job.
In an interview with the Daily Mail, Abraham revealed she'd be back on the operating table on Oct. 16, as her previous surgeries apparently left her with painful scar tissue. 
''I'm thankful to have the best reconstructive breast surgeon in the Beverly Hills area fix the burning and pain issues that were horrible," Abraham said. "I was happy to learn about new incision placement for better results as opposed to under the breast for my paining and burning to stop.'
No word on how the surgery went, but Abraham was back on Twitter Monday, promoting her appearance on "Botched: Post Op," which airs after the E! reality show "Botched" on Oct. 20.
