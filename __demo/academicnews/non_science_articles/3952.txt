 None 
 No. 11: Disney Dream Class.   Peter Knego 

 None 
 No. 11: Disney Dream Class. The two giant, black-topped crimson funnels certainly have their share of “Normandie-ness” but one wonders why Disney’s architects didn’t just give the Dream and Fantasy three stacks to achieve the ultimate effect. Peter Knego 

 None 
 No. 11: Disney Dream Class.  Even something as incidental as the tubing on the AquaDuck lends itself to close scrutiny. Clearly, no expense was spared in building these ships. Peter Knego

 None 
 No. 7: Star Flyer Class. Although their sails are augmented with Caterpillar diesels in order to maintain a set schedule, in every other aspect, these are true tall ships. Peter Knego 

 None 
 No. 7: Star Flyer Class. As with the Royal Clipper, Star Flyer and Star Clipper guests have access to a long bowsprit where they can dangle over a swelling sea. Guests can also climb to the mast platform. Peter Knego

 None 
 No. 6: Nordstjernen.   Peter Knego Collection

 No. 2: Queen Mary 2.   Peter Knego 

 None 
 No. 2: Queen Mary 2. Following the ship’s refurbishment or “remastering,” the interiors look better than ever. Passengers embark the QM2 via the Grand Lobby, which was given new carpeting and a more open floor plan after the removal of a pair of panoramic elevators. Peter Knego

 None 
 No. 1: Sea Cloud. There may be bigger sea-going accommodations but few can rival the Sea Cloud’s two top suites, which feature carved oak paneling, marble fireplaces and brass fittings. Sea Cloud Cruises
