Hilton Garden Inn sees rapid growth in 2017
Hilton Garden Inn will close out 2017 with more than 750 hotels worldwide.
The upscale brand averaged nearly one opening per week this year, with about one-third of the properties opening internationally.
The brand now has properties in 35 countries and territories. Six openings have occurred this month alone in locations such as Oklahoma City, India and Malaysia.
“These properties offer both business and leisure guests upscale yet affordable accommodations, while also providing best-in-class offerings for a brighter and more comfortable stay,” says John Greenleaf, global head of Hilton Garden Inn.
Hilton Garden Inn has gone through a refresh, including a healthier menu with small plates such as hummus with vegetables and flatbreads.
The strongest growth occurred in the southern USA. Texas and North Carolina accounted for eight openings collectively.
The brand also introduced properties in two Manhattan locations: Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South and Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center/Manhattan Downtown.

Internationally, Hilton Garden Inn debuted several new properties in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Europe.
Noteworthy international openings from the past year included:
China: Hilton Garden Inn Shanghai Hongqiao
Malaysia: Hilton Garden Inn Kuala Lumpur Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman
Mexico: Hilton Garden Inn Merida
Russia: Hilton Garden Inn Moscow Krasnoselskaya
Singapore: Hilton Garden Inn Singapore Serangoon
